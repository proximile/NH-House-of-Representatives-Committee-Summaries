00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 align:start position:0%
9 30. I'm going to go ahead and start
 
00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:04.160 align:start position:0%
the work session
 
00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 align:start position:0%
is not going to be the most well
 
00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 align:start position:0%
organized and from the exterior
 
00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
professionally polished meetings you've
 
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 align:start position:0%
ever seen what we're going to generally
 
00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:23.960 align:start position:0%
try to do
 
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
is work through all of our hb2 items and
 
00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 align:start position:0%
put them into buckets the items that we
 
00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 align:start position:0%
think we you know can agree to agree on
 
00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 align:start position:0%
that we can just accept I'd like to go
 
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 align:start position:0%
ahead and vote on them and and and
 
00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 align:start position:0%
have them categorized then if there are
 
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 align:start position:0%
still some hb2 items that we have you
 
00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 align:start position:0%
know further discussion and caucuses on
 
00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 align:start position:0%
you know we'll identify those and then
 
00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
if there are some ones that we've agreed
 
00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
to that need some changes then we'll
 
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 align:start position:0%
we'll do that as well so we'll I'd like
 
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 align:start position:0%
to have us as a goal for today to get
 
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 align:start position:0%
through all of the hb2 items and put
 
00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 align:start position:0%
them in into one of these three buckets
 
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:41.330 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.069 align:start position:0%
 
now

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 align:start position:0%
I I see people from the Department here
 
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:47.929 align:start position:0%
I I see people from the Department here
today

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 align:start position:0%
uh are you here for the whole day or are
 
00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 align:start position:0%
you here for specific items that we
 
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 align:start position:0%
good morning Nathan white Chief
 
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 align:start position:0%
Financial Officer Department of Health
 
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 align:start position:0%
and Human Services
 
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 align:start position:0%
um I I had I had asked Henry Littman to
 
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
come here this morning to address the
 
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
rate questions around the Medicaid rates
 
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 align:start position:0%
and then Katya Fox is here to speak to
 
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 align:start position:0%
some of the appropriations of the
 
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 align:start position:0%
governor's commission and one of our one
 
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
of our prioritized needs as well
 
00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
concerning dvh
 
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 align:start position:0%
and our associate commissioner Ann
 
00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
Landry is here as well to answer
 
00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.030 align:start position:0%
Landry is here as well to answer
questions

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:34.670 align:start position:0%
okay so
um

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 align:start position:0%
so it's good because with Miss Fox here
 
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
and Mr lippman those those were two
 
00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 align:start position:0%
early things I wanted to bring up anyway
 
00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 align:start position:0%
so that that dovetails nicely
 
00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 align:start position:0%
or when when Mr Ripple is ready
 
00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:55.379 align:start position:0%
um I I think I'd like to start
 
00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:56.270 align:start position:0%
um I I think I'd like to start
um

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 align:start position:0%
I I don't know if we're going to be able
 
00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 align:start position:0%
to come to any conclusions on this but
 
00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 align:start position:0%
I'd like to start with the alcohol and
 
00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 align:start position:0%
drug abuse prevention treatment and
 
00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 align:start position:0%
Recovery commission issues there are two
 
00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 align:start position:0%
hb2 items in there that we've discussed
 
00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 align:start position:0%
in previous hearings section 89 section
 
00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 align:start position:0%
99 and
 
00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
um and and then there would be related
 
00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 align:start position:0%
actions that we would take on hb1 Miss
 
00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 align:start position:0%
Ripple has put together a package for us
 
00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
with the summary sheet and then there
 
00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 align:start position:0%
are some specific amendments that we
 
00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 align:start position:0%
could we could vote on so go you want to
 
00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879 align:start position:0%
start us off sure and so I'll actually
 
00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
start not with the summary sheet but
 
00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 align:start position:0%
with the First Amendment the house bill
 
00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 align:start position:0%
and this is sort of a complicated
 
00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 align:start position:0%
Amendment but the goal is simple the
 
00:03:54.649 --> 00:03:54.659 align:start position:0%
goal is to keep the five percent of
 
00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 align:start position:0%
liquor revenues in the alcohol fund and
 
00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
prevent them from being transferred to
 
00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 align:start position:0%
the granted Advantage Program to help
 
00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
so I'll go through this section by
 
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.130 align:start position:0%
so I'll go through this section by
section

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 align:start position:0%
but I'm not can I just come back and say
 
00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 align:start position:0%
why we're doing this sure okay I I in in
 
00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
my view what I'd like to have us trying
 
00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
to do is to protect the alcohol and drug
 
00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 align:start position:0%
commissions money the five percent that
 
00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 align:start position:0%
they get from the alcohol
 
00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 align:start position:0%
or from the alcohol fund and those
 
00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 align:start position:0%
monies have periodically been tapped
 
00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 align:start position:0%
into and used for other purposes of the
 
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
state and then we've found some ways to
 
00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 align:start position:0%
backfill them and so I'd like to just
 
00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
get that all cleaned up Let the alcohol
 
00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 align:start position:0%
commission have their money uh if it was
 
00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
five percent was committed and so so
 
00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
what what I asked Mr Ripple to do was to
 
00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 align:start position:0%
make it clear that that we want to
 
00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
protect that five percent so that later
 
00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 align:start position:0%
we can come back and clean up the
 
00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 align:start position:0%
dysfunctional things we were doing
 
00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 align:start position:0%
trying to to get access to some cash so
 
00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 align:start position:0%
so that's that's what I think this bill
 
00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
does do you want to go through the
 
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:18.110 align:start position:0%
does do you want to go through the
sure

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 align:start position:0%
I'll actually start with Section Five of
 
00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 align:start position:0%
the amendment which repeals certain
 
00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 align:start position:0%
statutory Provisions relative to
 
00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
transfers from the alcohol fund so these
 
00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
are the statutes that require that that
 
00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 align:start position:0%
five percent of liquor revenues be
 
00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 align:start position:0%
transferred from the alcohol fund to
 
00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
granted Advantage so those would be
 
00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 align:start position:0%
going back to section one that section
 
00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:45.539 align:start position:0%
would likewise
 
00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:47.900 align:start position:0%
repeal a provision in existing statute
 
00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 align:start position:0%
that refers to the transfer of alcohol
 
00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:51.650 align:start position:0%
that refers to the transfer of alcohol
funds

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:51.660 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
of liquor funds rather from the alcohol
 
00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:55.320 align:start position:0%
fund to granted Advantage so this is
 
00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180 align:start position:0%
just statutory cleanup to accomplish
 
00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
what representative Edwards wanted to
 
00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.210 align:start position:0%
what representative Edwards wanted to
accomplish

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:02.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 align:start position:0%
section two
 
00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:07.259 align:start position:0%
is in recognition of the fact that New
 
00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:08.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's hospitals are still
 
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:10.320 align:start position:0%
committed to
 
00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:13.199 align:start position:0%
one last five million dollar voluntary
 
00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
donation which I believe is scheduled to
 
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:16.860 align:start position:0%
take place at the end of this calendar
 
00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.290 align:start position:0%
take place at the end of this calendar
year

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:18.300 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:22.380 align:start position:0%
so section 2 would reduce the transfers
 
00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:25.259 align:start position:0%
from liquor to the alcohol fund by the
 
00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.060 align:start position:0%
amount of that donation so in other
 
00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.150 align:start position:0%
amount of that donation so in other
words

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:29.160 align:start position:0%
words
 
00:06:31.249 --> 00:06:31.259 align:start position:0%
if five percent of liquor revenues
 
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.240 align:start position:0%
equals 11 million dollars
 
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:35.580 align:start position:0%
and the hospitals give a five million
 
00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:38.039 align:start position:0%
dollar donation the alcohol fund would
 
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
be kept whole at 11 million dollars but
 
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:42.060 align:start position:0%
six of it would come from liquor and
 
00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:43.500 align:start position:0%
five million of it would come from the
 
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:44.629 align:start position:0%
five million of it would come from the
donations

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:44.639 align:start position:0%
donations
 
00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:47.220 align:start position:0%
otherwise absent this section
 
00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:49.020 align:start position:0%
the governor's commission and the
 
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
alcohol fund would get 11 million plus
 
00:06:59.570 --> 00:06:59.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
sections three and four
 
00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
are more statutory cleanup that relate
 
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
to the granted Advantage Program so I'm
 
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:09.720 align:start position:0%
going to try not to go into this in too
 
00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:11.580 align:start position:0%
much detail but granted Advantage is
 
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:13.080 align:start position:0%
currently funded from a variety of
 
00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:15.060 align:start position:0%
funding sources one of which is this
 
00:07:17.809 --> 00:07:17.819 align:start position:0%
transfer from the alcohol fund if that
 
00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:19.560 align:start position:0%
transfer from the alcohol fund is
 
00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:22.740 align:start position:0%
removed then it disrupts other pieces of
 
00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:24.660 align:start position:0%
the funding scheme
 
00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
so three and four are designed to remedy
 
00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:29.220 align:start position:0%
that and this language was taken
 
00:07:32.029 --> 00:07:32.039 align:start position:0%
directly from Senate Bill 263 which is
 
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:33.720 align:start position:0%
the Senate bill that reauthorizes the
 
00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:36.360 align:start position:0%
granted Advantage Program however
 
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:39.240 align:start position:0%
since this amendment
 
00:07:41.629 --> 00:07:41.639 align:start position:0%
is not intended to reauthorize granted
 
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:43.740 align:start position:0%
Advantage you'll notice that there is
 
00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:46.740 align:start position:0%
contingency language
 
00:07:50.809 --> 00:07:50.819 align:start position:0%
on page two lines 14 through 16 that say
 
00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:52.500 align:start position:0%
the sections three and four shall only
 
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
take effect if the granted Advantage
 
00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
Program is reauthorized
 
00:07:58.850 --> 00:07:58.860 align:start position:0%
so the other sections of this bill will
 
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
take effect no matter what three and
 
00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
four only take effect if granted
 
00:08:05.809 --> 00:08:05.819 align:start position:0%
Advantage is reauthorized I realize that
 
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
may have been a little bit convoluted so
 
00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:09.300 align:start position:0%
if anybody has any questions please let
 
00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:11.460 align:start position:0%
me know you know the fact that it's
 
00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:13.860 align:start position:0%
convoluted I think it makes the point
 
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:16.380 align:start position:0%
that if we're going to try to clean this
 
00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:17.940 align:start position:0%
up and provide everyone with
 
00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:20.220 align:start position:0%
transparency and maintenance of
 
00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:23.460 align:start position:0%
principles we've we've gotten it muddied
 
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
up and messed up and this is trying to
 
00:08:27.589 --> 00:08:27.599 align:start position:0%
deconflict it so in the future we know
 
00:08:29.749 --> 00:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
what we're doing and we you know know
 
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
how to talk about what we're doing so so
 
00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
do you have go ahead representative
 
00:08:37.969 --> 00:08:37.979 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm wondering if you could
 
00:08:39.829 --> 00:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
give me an idea of how much money we're
 
00:08:41.269 --> 00:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
talking about here that's being
 
00:08:42.829 --> 00:08:42.839 align:start position:0%
transferred from the fund to Grant
 
00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:44.580 align:start position:0%
Advantage Program it's about 11 million
 
00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:46.980 align:start position:0%
per year 11
 
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
. in in that summary sheet that was on
 
00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:52.440 align:start position:0%
the top of it that does kind of help in
 
00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:53.700 align:start position:0%
that regard
 
00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
representative Wallner
 
00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:03.660 align:start position:0%
thank you I wonder if we could have
 
00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:06.180 align:start position:0%
um Mr lippman talk just for a minute
 
00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:08.700 align:start position:0%
about how all of this affects the
 
00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:10.740 align:start position:0%
granite Advantage Program
 
00:09:29.329 --> 00:09:29.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:31.800 align:start position:0%
good morning for the record uh Henry in
 
00:09:34.009 --> 00:09:34.019 align:start position:0%
the state's Medicaid director thank you
 
00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:36.660 align:start position:0%
for the question
 
00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:37.550 align:start position:0%
for the question
um

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
I think that
 
00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:43.320 align:start position:0%
the the expectation of how things were
 
00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:45.660 align:start position:0%
going to potentially transition
 
00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:46.670 align:start position:0%
going to potentially transition
um

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:49.320 align:start position:0%
in what Kevin Ripple has provided to you
 
00:09:53.329 --> 00:09:53.339 align:start position:0%
is something that I've vetted with with
 
00:09:53.339 --> 00:09:54.290 align:start position:0%
is something that I've vetted with with
him

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:54.300 align:start position:0%
him
 
00:09:58.370 --> 00:09:58.380 align:start position:0%
um so in terms of what we expect is that
 
00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
the provision that was passed as part of
 
00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:04.700 align:start position:0%
hb4 in 2019 that allows
 
00:10:10.329 --> 00:10:10.339 align:start position:0%
Granite Advantage Program to tap into
 
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
a different liquor account if you will
 
00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:17.820 align:start position:0%
to take to get to fill in any Gap that's
 
00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:19.620 align:start position:0%
necessary that doesn't come through the
 
00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:21.180 align:start position:0%
other funding sources
 
00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
and that's that's a fixed amount
 
00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:25.790 align:start position:0%
and that's that's a fixed amount
predicted

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
predicted
 
00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:26.630 align:start position:0%
predicted
um

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
uh in Senate Bill 263 based on roughly
 
00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
the number that's in here with a with an
 
00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:36.180 align:start position:0%
inflation Factor so I think this all as
 
00:10:38.329 --> 00:10:38.339 align:start position:0%
kept Kevin has explained it all holds
 
00:10:38.339 --> 00:10:39.590 align:start position:0%
kept Kevin has explained it all holds
together

00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
that if granted Advantage is
 
00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:44.700 align:start position:0%
reauthorized that there is
 
00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:45.590 align:start position:0%
reauthorized that there is
um

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:48.120 align:start position:0%
all the pieces that stack up to provide
 
00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:51.660 align:start position:0%
the non-federal share are there to uh to
 
00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
support it if in fact it is reauthorized
 
00:10:58.970 --> 00:10:58.980 align:start position:0%
it and if it helps represent walner one
 
00:11:01.009 --> 00:11:01.019 align:start position:0%
one of the things I can tell you is it
 
00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
feels to me like the GOP caucus is
 
00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
leaning towards reauthorization of the
 
00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:09.320 align:start position:0%
of the Granite State Advantage Program
 
00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:12.180 align:start position:0%
the this the distinction we may have
 
00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:14.700 align:start position:0%
with the Senate is we might rather than
 
00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
make it permanent want to go ahead and
 
00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:19.860 align:start position:0%
just come up with another grandfather or
 
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
Sunset date in the future so that that
 
00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:24.060 align:start position:0%
that's the only debating Point not
 
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:32.870 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:34.860 align:start position:0%
I just want a minute to take a look at
 
00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:41.569 align:start position:0%
I just want a minute to take a look at
this

00:11:41.569 --> 00:11:41.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:41.579 --> 00:11:45.610 align:start position:0%
 
hmm

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:45.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:48.060 align:start position:0%
so if you're ready I can move on to the
 
00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:50.700 align:start position:0%
next sheet I I think you're you're ready
 
00:11:57.829 --> 00:11:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:00.060 align:start position:0%
I can move on to the house bill one
 
00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:11.870 align:start position:0%
I can move on to the house bill one
Amendment

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:13.620 align:start position:0%
so as you can see from the description
 
00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:15.420 align:start position:0%
uh this amendment does a couple things
 
00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:17.700 align:start position:0%
it assumes that five percent of gross
 
00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:19.260 align:start position:0%
liquor profits will remain in the
 
00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:21.060 align:start position:0%
alcohol fund and not be transferred to
 
00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:22.980 align:start position:0%
granted advantage that's consistent with
 
00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:24.360 align:start position:0%
the house bill 2 amendment that you just
 
00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:25.730 align:start position:0%
the house bill 2 amendment that you just
saw

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:25.740 align:start position:0%
saw
 
00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:27.540 align:start position:0%
it also assumes that five percent of
 
00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:29.700 align:start position:0%
gross liquor profits won't be the
 
00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:31.260 align:start position:0%
roughly 10 million dollars that was in
 
00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:33.420 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget but rather 11.1
 
00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:35.820 align:start position:0%
million and 24 and 11 million in fiscal
 
00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:39.060 align:start position:0%
25. excuse me that's consistent with the
 
00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:40.500 align:start position:0%
revenue estimates that were adopted by
 
00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:42.300 align:start position:0%
house Ways and Means
 
00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:44.820 align:start position:0%
I I assume that you're talking
 
00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
specifically to uh or what are you
 
00:12:50.509 --> 00:12:50.519 align:start position:0%
talking to I'm talking to the one that
 
00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:52.820 align:start position:0%
looks like a spreadsheet here
 
00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:59.389 --> 00:12:59.399 align:start position:0%
and finally it assumes one final five
 
00:13:01.129 --> 00:13:01.139 align:start position:0%
million dollar donations will be made by
 
00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:03.420 align:start position:0%
the hospitals in 24.
 
00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:05.220 align:start position:0%
and that the transfer from liquor
 
00:13:07.269 --> 00:13:07.279 align:start position:0%
revenues will be reduced accordingly
 
00:13:09.829 --> 00:13:09.839 align:start position:0%
excuse me and again that's consistent
 
00:13:11.329 --> 00:13:11.339 align:start position:0%
with section two of the House Bill 2
 
00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:17.700 align:start position:0%
so if you go down to the bottom of this
 
00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:21.660 align:start position:0%
in the change column for fiscal 24
 
00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
down below where it says source of funds
 
00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
005 private local funds that five
 
00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:29.220 align:start position:0%
million dollars reflects reflects the
 
00:13:32.389 --> 00:13:32.399 align:start position:0%
transfer from the hospitals or the
 
00:13:35.329 --> 00:13:35.339 align:start position:0%
donation from the hospitals
 
00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
and where you go down to the total under
 
00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:40.260 align:start position:0%
revised budget it says 11.1 million and
 
00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:43.740 align:start position:0%
twenty four and 11 million and 25 that
 
00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:46.680 align:start position:0%
reflects the the total amount that the
 
00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:48.540 align:start position:0%
alcohol fund would receive and those
 
00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:50.820 align:start position:0%
amounts equate to an estimated five
 
00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
percent of gross liquor profits in each
 
00:13:52.680 --> 00:14:11.110 align:start position:0%
percent of gross liquor profits in each
year

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:14.940 align:start position:0%
I'm waiting for questions or body
 
00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:21.829 --> 00:14:21.839 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
representable I have a 10 o'clock Bill
 
00:14:27.769 --> 00:14:27.779 align:start position:0%
introduction in division two that I will
 
00:14:32.449 --> 00:14:32.459 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:34.009 --> 00:14:34.019 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
said Kevin could can you address the
 
00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:41.220 align:start position:0%
change the 389 the 3.8 million in the
 
00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
change column
 
00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
talk again about that that is the
 
00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
reduction in agency income that agency
 
00:14:48.829 --> 00:14:48.839 align:start position:0%
income refers to
 
00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
what would now be the term the transfer
 
00:14:54.129 --> 00:14:54.139 align:start position:0%
from liquor so that's going down because
 
00:14:56.689 --> 00:14:56.699 align:start position:0%
this amendment assumes the 5 million
 
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:05.569 --> 00:15:05.579 align:start position:0%
can I just ask is that
 
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
is that something the hospitals
 
00:15:11.629 --> 00:15:11.639 align:start position:0%
have verified with us
 
00:15:11.639 --> 00:15:14.930 align:start position:0%
have verified with us
yes

00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:14.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:19.129 --> 00:15:19.139 align:start position:0%
um it's actually their CMS in terms of
 
00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:22.260 align:start position:0%
viewing our funding for granted
 
00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:23.290 align:start position:0%
viewing our funding for granted
Advantage

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:23.300 align:start position:0%
Advantage
 
00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:25.740 align:start position:0%
came back with
 
00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
change in administrations that that that
 
00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:30.540 align:start position:0%
that that source of funding because
 
00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:32.760 align:start position:0%
there's a connection between
 
00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:36.060 align:start position:0%
um the people being covered that they
 
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
didn't want that to be in place and they
 
00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:41.820 align:start position:0%
gave us uh the chance to unwind if you
 
00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:45.540 align:start position:0%
will the uh the timing of it with the
 
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
last donation that was agreed to and so
 
00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:51.620 align:start position:0%
that is something that uh We've
 
00:15:53.509 --> 00:15:53.519 align:start position:0%
acknowledged with them that we would
 
00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
comply with
 
00:15:57.889 --> 00:15:57.899 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
to to the follow-up to that I think is
 
00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:03.540 align:start position:0%
was that yes we have confirmed that the
 
00:16:05.449 --> 00:16:05.459 align:start position:0%
hospitals are committed to the 5 million
 
00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:07.380 align:start position:0%
I think what you just said was CMS
 
00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
understands what we're doing and they're
 
00:16:11.509 --> 00:16:11.519 align:start position:0%
okay with that unwind but it's the are
 
00:16:14.449 --> 00:16:14.459 align:start position:0%
the hospitals committed I don't have any
 
00:16:15.949 --> 00:16:15.959 align:start position:0%
indication that I don't have a direct
 
00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:19.260 align:start position:0%
indication that they aren't
 
00:16:21.769 --> 00:16:21.779 align:start position:0%
um and we can double check with them if
 
00:16:23.629 --> 00:16:23.639 align:start position:0%
you'd like haven't asked the question
 
00:16:26.889 --> 00:16:26.899 align:start position:0%
they've complied they've you know
 
00:16:29.329 --> 00:16:29.339 align:start position:0%
complied with their commitment
 
00:16:31.069 --> 00:16:31.079 align:start position:0%
um all the other times so I have no
 
00:16:32.569 --> 00:16:32.579 align:start position:0%
reason to believe that they won't all
 
00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:36.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
so just to go back to that 24 change
 
00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:41.220 align:start position:0%
column the reason you see that negative
 
00:16:44.509 --> 00:16:44.519 align:start position:0%
3.9 million figure is because the
 
00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
appropriation goes up by 1.1 million
 
00:16:50.449 --> 00:16:50.459 align:start position:0%
to reflect that five percent of liquor
 
00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:52.980 align:start position:0%
revenues will equal 11.1 rather than 10
 
00:16:54.949 --> 00:16:54.959 align:start position:0%
is in the governor's budget
 
00:16:56.449 --> 00:16:56.459 align:start position:0%
but then
 
00:16:58.910 --> 00:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
the transfer from liquor revenues goes
 
00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:01.009 align:start position:0%
the transfer from liquor revenues goes
down

00:17:01.009 --> 00:17:01.019 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:17:03.769 --> 00:17:03.779 align:start position:0%
by 5 million from that because of the
 
00:17:05.329 --> 00:17:05.339 align:start position:0%
hospital's donation so there's a net
 
00:17:07.549 --> 00:17:07.559 align:start position:0%
reduction in agency income of 3.9
 
00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:15.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
sorry to be I mean this is the first
 
00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:22.380 align:start position:0%
time I've seen this morning so
 
00:17:25.189 --> 00:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
something I'm not that familiar with so
 
00:17:28.429 --> 00:17:28.439 align:start position:0%
in the second year in 2025
 
00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:31.860 align:start position:0%
you're anticipating no hospital donation
 
00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:34.620 align:start position:0%
correct the last one will occur on or
 
00:17:38.029 --> 00:17:38.039 align:start position:0%
before December 31st of this year and it
 
00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
will all come out of the liquor fund yes
 
00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:42.470 align:start position:0%
will all come out of the liquor fund yes
and

00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
the the liquor fund has produced
 
00:17:46.549 --> 00:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:49.980 align:start position:0%
over 10 million in each of the most
 
00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:51.780 align:start position:0%
recent years so
 
00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:57.830 align:start position:0%
recent years so
um

00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:00.110 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
right Mike please get it quote yeah
 
00:18:10.669 --> 00:18:10.679 align:start position:0%
looks like
 
00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:13.140 align:start position:0%
looks like in his comments to make he
 
00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:16.740 align:start position:0%
keeps almost touching his microphone I'm
 
00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
I'm just ready to go in case I need to
 
00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:20.940 align:start position:0%
be that's all
 
00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
okay you're sure okay
 
00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:26.510 align:start position:0%
okay you're sure okay
sorry

00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:29.580 align:start position:0%
okay all right so go ahead so if you
 
00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:31.380 align:start position:0%
move on to the next two pages these are
 
00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:34.340 align:start position:0%
much more straightforward Amendment
 
00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:38.940 align:start position:0%
0958h delete section 89
 
00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:42.900 align:start position:0%
and 90 of the trailer bill
 
00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
and that's a two million 54 000
 
00:18:47.029 --> 00:18:47.039 align:start position:0%
appropriation for the recovery friendly
 
00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:52.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:55.620 align:start position:0%
so we've discussed those two deletions
 
00:18:57.970 --> 00:18:57.980 align:start position:0%
in the past as we've gone through hb2
 
00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
saying if if we could clean up the way
 
00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:04.740 align:start position:0%
the liquor fund money is flowing and the
 
00:19:06.409 --> 00:19:06.419 align:start position:0%
way we're funding the granite state
 
00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
Advantage Program have that transparent
 
00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:12.360 align:start position:0%
then these two hb2 items become
 
00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:14.150 align:start position:0%
then these two hb2 items become
redundant

00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
redundant
 
00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:17.590 align:start position:0%
redundant
so

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
so that completes the packet doesn't it
 
00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:23.820 align:start position:0%
the the final amendment is 0.960h which
 
00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:26.940 align:start position:0%
deletes section 99 which is 1.5 million
 
00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:29.460 align:start position:0%
per year I believe
 
00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:31.500 align:start position:0%
yes for Student Assistance programming
 
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
which is also an appropriation to the
 
00:19:34.789 --> 00:19:34.799 align:start position:0%
governor's Commission
 
00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:37.860 align:start position:0%
so now that you've seen those I would
 
00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
now go back to the summary sheets on
 
00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
page one unless there are questions do
 
00:19:43.909 --> 00:19:43.919 align:start position:0%
you have a question here
 
00:19:47.029 --> 00:19:47.039 align:start position:0%
what is the Student Assistance Program
 
00:19:47.039 --> 00:19:48.770 align:start position:0%
what is the Student Assistance Program
Ming

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:48.780 align:start position:0%
Ming
 
00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:50.220 align:start position:0%
is the question what is it what is it
 
00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
what is the student assistance program
 
00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:53.160 align:start position:0%
that is now losing one and a half
 
00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
million per year I I would ask the
 
00:20:06.049 --> 00:20:06.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:08.340 align:start position:0%
good morning for the record I'm Katya
 
00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:10.020 align:start position:0%
Fox I'm the director of the division for
 
00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:11.940 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health
 
00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:13.860 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:17.100 align:start position:0%
if it's okay Mr chair I'd like to just
 
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
make a clarification on the
 
00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:21.660 align:start position:0%
recommendations and the amendment that
 
00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
deletes those provisions of hb2 just
 
00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
because I want to point out that those
 
00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:31.860 align:start position:0%
are with State fiscal year 23 funds so
 
00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:34.260 align:start position:0%
we'll do that okay let's let's answer
 
00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
representative I just I hit the floor
 
00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:38.460 align:start position:0%
and I I wanted to take advantage of it
 
00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:41.820 align:start position:0%
so I will be more direct
 
00:20:46.549 --> 00:20:46.559 align:start position:0%
is a program that provides counselors in
 
00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:49.740 align:start position:0%
schools to address substance misuse
 
00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:52.620 align:start position:0%
among the student body but and it's
 
00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:55.140 align:start position:0%
really considered to be primary
 
00:20:57.710 --> 00:20:57.720 align:start position:0%
prevention so available to the whole
 
00:21:00.409 --> 00:21:00.419 align:start position:0%
school but also for individual
 
00:21:00.419 --> 00:21:02.450 align:start position:0%
school but also for individual
situations

00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:02.460 align:start position:0%
situations
 
00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:02.990 align:start position:0%
situations
um

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
and it has been adopted across the state
 
00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:07.980 align:start position:0%
by school districts they participate
 
00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:10.580 align:start position:0%
they have a financial contribution
 
00:21:13.789 --> 00:21:13.799 align:start position:0%
and make a local decision by their
 
00:21:15.409 --> 00:21:15.419 align:start position:0%
school board to participate in the
 
00:21:15.419 --> 00:21:16.750 align:start position:0%
school board to participate in the
program

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
and it I can get a list of schools but
 
00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
so the schools have teeth in the game
 
00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
here to participate and to maximize
 
00:21:34.669 --> 00:21:34.679 align:start position:0%
their benefit of the program yes is it a
 
00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:38.220 align:start position:0%
50 50 match or I believe it's 25 and
 
00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:40.440 align:start position:0%
there are some circumstances if a school
 
00:21:43.909 --> 00:21:43.919 align:start position:0%
district wants to join the program that
 
00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:47.220 align:start position:0%
we consider that an available funding
 
00:21:51.169 --> 00:21:51.179 align:start position:0%
so it may be lesson thank you
 
00:21:54.049 --> 00:21:54.059 align:start position:0%
could I ask her
 
00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:21:57.470 --> 00:21:57.480 align:start position:0%
so how long has this program been in
 
00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:58.730 align:start position:0%
so how long has this program been in
existence

00:21:58.730 --> 00:21:58.740 align:start position:0%
existence
 
00:22:00.529 --> 00:22:00.539 align:start position:0%
I would need to get back to you on that
 
00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:02.280 align:start position:0%
it's been
 
00:22:04.669 --> 00:22:04.679 align:start position:0%
again I don't know the exact year it
 
00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:07.320 align:start position:0%
started but it's a number of years and
 
00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't it have shown up in the
 
00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:09.890 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't it have shown up in the
budget

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:09.900 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
so it is has been funded through the
 
00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:17.400 align:start position:0%
governor's commission and you wouldn't
 
00:22:19.669 --> 00:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
normally see Appropriations to specific
 
00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:22.380 align:start position:0%
programming you would just it would be
 
00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
the governor's commission line in our
 
00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
budget and they've made the decision to
 
00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
support that program we also use block
 
00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:32.460 align:start position:0%
grant so Federal block grant money
 
00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:35.640 align:start position:0%
towards the program
 
00:22:37.669 --> 00:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
so what does it mean if this program is
 
00:22:37.679 --> 00:22:38.930 align:start position:0%
so what does it mean if this program is
deleted

00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:38.940 align:start position:0%
deleted
 
00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:43.020 align:start position:0%
so this particular appropriation
 
00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
um I just want to double check it and
 
00:22:47.149 --> 00:22:47.159 align:start position:0%
may need to have
 
00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:49.700 align:start position:0%
okay I'm going to try to answer that
 
00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:52.860 align:start position:0%
I think what we wouldn't be deleting the
 
00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:55.320 align:start position:0%
program we'd be deleting the hb2 item
 
00:22:57.950 --> 00:22:57.960 align:start position:0%
that funds the program directly from the
 
00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
the commission unentangled from these
 
00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
other items the commission can do what
 
00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:10.200 align:start position:0%
they've done in the past which is to
 
00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
fund the program
 
00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
because we've been borrowing money from
 
00:23:16.789 --> 00:23:16.799 align:start position:0%
them we've
 
00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:20.820 align:start position:0%
this hp2 item was there to replace some
 
00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:22.260 align:start position:0%
of the money that we've been borrowing
 
00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
from them for the granite state
 
00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:26.220 align:start position:0%
Advantage Program
 
00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:29.220 align:start position:0%
is that correct is that close
 
00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:31.140 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure about the mechanics of that
 
00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:34.260 align:start position:0%
but yes it does not change the funding
 
00:23:36.409 --> 00:23:36.419 align:start position:0%
available to the program based on
 
00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
Governor's commission actions and the
 
00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:41.820 align:start position:0%
votes that they have taken this would
 
00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:44.100 align:start position:0%
have been additive and it would have
 
00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:47.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:49.669 --> 00:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
so it's currently the commission
 
00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:53.700 align:start position:0%
recently voted for its 20 State fiscal
 
00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:55.280 align:start position:0%
year 24
 
00:23:58.250 --> 00:23:58.260 align:start position:0%
Appropriations and it continues to
 
00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:01.860 align:start position:0%
support this program at level funding
 
00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:07.500 align:start position:0%
um and again this particular item won't
 
00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:10.020 align:start position:0%
delete the program or eliminate the
 
00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:11.820 align:start position:0%
program across the state it would have
 
00:24:13.669 --> 00:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
expanded the program so that we could
 
00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:16.500 align:start position:0%
Target middle schools as part of this
 
00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:18.649 align:start position:0%
Target middle schools as part of this
program

00:24:18.649 --> 00:24:18.659 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:21.720 align:start position:0%
and and what is level funding
 
00:24:24.409 --> 00:24:24.419 align:start position:0%
I do not have that right in front of me
 
00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:27.780 align:start position:0%
um I I can get that back for you
 
00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:31.260 align:start position:0%
it's multiple sources of funds so we
 
00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:32.940 align:start position:0%
would need to go to the contract to find
 
00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
to get that information
 
00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:38.340 align:start position:0%
would this if we kept this wouldn't this
 
00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:40.740 align:start position:0%
be the setting a precedent of being the
 
00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
first time that we've used General funds
 
00:24:46.789 --> 00:24:46.799 align:start position:0%
to basically pay for the Liquor
 
00:24:49.549 --> 00:24:49.559 align:start position:0%
Commission programs or the alcohol and
 
00:24:52.149 --> 00:24:52.159 align:start position:0%
drug abuse commission programs
 
00:24:55.789 --> 00:24:55.799 align:start position:0%
I can't say whether or not it would be
 
00:24:58.070 --> 00:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
the first time I think that funds were
 
00:24:59.870 --> 00:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
General funds were appropriated to the
 
00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
governor's commission versus the other
 
00:25:05.029 --> 00:25:05.039 align:start position:0%
funds the from the liquor through the
 
00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:06.360 align:start position:0%
alcohol so that's what I'm trying to
 
00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:08.940 align:start position:0%
avoid is setting a new precedent that
 
00:25:10.789 --> 00:25:10.799 align:start position:0%
and I would rather let the commission
 
00:25:13.789 --> 00:25:13.799 align:start position:0%
have their all of their money the whole
 
00:25:15.529 --> 00:25:15.539 align:start position:0%
five percent that they haven't been
 
00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:17.580 align:start position:0%
getting and just let them make their
 
00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:19.500 align:start position:0%
decisions on what their priorities are
 
00:25:24.409 --> 00:25:24.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:26.940 align:start position:0%
representative thank you
 
00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:28.500 align:start position:0%
um I was going to ask before we got to
 
00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:31.620 align:start position:0%
that question about the um the ages of
 
00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:33.480 align:start position:0%
the students who received this plan so
 
00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:34.980 align:start position:0%
just to make sure I understand what you
 
00:25:36.289 --> 00:25:36.299 align:start position:0%
just said
 
00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
um without this the plan would not be
 
00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
able to expand to the Middle School
 
00:25:42.049 --> 00:25:42.059 align:start position:0%
level there
 
00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:43.980 align:start position:0%
um thank you for that question there are
 
00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
some schools that have it in the middle
 
00:25:50.029 --> 00:25:50.039 align:start position:0%
school now this would allow us to
 
00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
provide more support for additional
 
00:25:54.049 --> 00:25:54.059 align:start position:0%
middle schools
 
00:25:59.690 --> 00:25:59.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:01.909 --> 00:26:01.919 align:start position:0%
could could the commission come back and
 
00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:04.140 align:start position:0%
because we're giving them more of their
 
00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:05.700 align:start position:0%
five percent
 
00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:08.700 align:start position:0%
okay pay for the program expansion to
 
00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:13.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
it's a decision they would make as a
 
00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:17.100 align:start position:0%
group that would be up to the commission
 
00:26:19.549 --> 00:26:19.559 align:start position:0%
right bacon they can choose but we're
 
00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:20.820 align:start position:0%
trying to make sure they have the
 
00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:22.620 align:start position:0%
additional resources so they can run
 
00:26:25.549 --> 00:26:25.559 align:start position:0%
their programs that that that's that's
 
00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:33.289 --> 00:26:33.299 align:start position:0%
I guess not knowing a whole lot about
 
00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:36.360 align:start position:0%
how the commission works is there
 
00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:38.580 align:start position:0%
availability and flexibility in the
 
00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
commission's budget to be able to
 
00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:43.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:46.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for that because that does
 
00:26:49.909 --> 00:26:49.919 align:start position:0%
point out that the commission has been
 
00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:52.380 align:start position:0%
appropriated 10 million dollars with the
 
00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:54.500 align:start position:0%
donations over the last several years
 
00:26:57.789 --> 00:26:57.799 align:start position:0%
and the change to the five percent
 
00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:02.100 align:start position:0%
as indicated by the LBA that's expected
 
00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:04.020 align:start position:0%
to bump up the amount of available
 
00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
dollars right now the commission has
 
00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:11.340 align:start position:0%
been pretty diligent about appropriating
 
00:27:15.289 --> 00:27:15.299 align:start position:0%
um and taking votes to fully expend the
 
00:27:16.789 --> 00:27:16.799 align:start position:0%
amount of dollars they have it's a
 
00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:19.140 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing account
 
00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:23.400 align:start position:0%
um so they will have some flexibility on
 
00:27:37.669 --> 00:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:41.220 align:start position:0%
to representative I'm I'm on that
 
00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
commission as is Miss Fox and there it
 
00:27:48.049 --> 00:27:48.059 align:start position:0%
feels like there's at least 30 if not 40
 
00:27:49.669 --> 00:27:49.679 align:start position:0%
people representing a broad
 
00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:51.720 align:start position:0%
cross-section of stakeholders throughout
 
00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
the state all of them looking at the
 
00:27:57.169 --> 00:27:57.179 align:start position:0%
Strategic function of the commission
 
00:27:59.049 --> 00:27:59.059 align:start position:0%
which is to
 
00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:04.440 align:start position:0%
prevent uh treat and support in any of
 
00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:07.320 align:start position:0%
the negative consequences of alcohol or
 
00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:09.480 align:start position:0%
drug abuse and so they've broken them
 
00:28:12.529 --> 00:28:12.539 align:start position:0%
down into task forces the task forces
 
00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:14.820 align:start position:0%
look at their areas and they come back
 
00:28:16.610 --> 00:28:16.620 align:start position:0%
with budget recommendations so the
 
00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
commission has a fairly disciplined
 
00:28:23.570 --> 00:28:23.580 align:start position:0%
budget process within itself spending
 
00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:25.740 align:start position:0%
their own money I I don't know if that's
 
00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:28.140 align:start position:0%
more information than you wanted but if
 
00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:29.460 align:start position:0%
you didn't know what the commission was
 
00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
it should be a little more no that's
 
00:28:33.649 --> 00:28:33.659 align:start position:0%
fine I just I have an interest in this
 
00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:35.220 align:start position:0%
because of um
 
00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:37.140 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Coalition of New
 
00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:38.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire prevention Coalition had
 
00:28:40.549 --> 00:28:40.559 align:start position:0%
reached out to me about some funding
 
00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:43.980 align:start position:0%
that they had presented to the
 
00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
governor's budget office that they
 
00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:47.820 align:start position:0%
didn't receive and I intend to
 
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
um submit an amendment to try to assist
 
00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
those programs so I guess I'm trying to
 
00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:52.620 align:start position:0%
wrap my brain around the big picture of
 
00:28:54.409 --> 00:28:54.419 align:start position:0%
of where those resources are being
 
00:28:54.419 --> 00:28:57.350 align:start position:0%
of where those resources are being
expended

00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:01.380 align:start position:0%
are we through with the this package
 
00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
well I did want to go through the rest
 
00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:04.620 align:start position:0%
of the summary sheet
 
00:29:06.529 --> 00:29:06.539 align:start position:0%
um go ahead so the first two lines on
 
00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:08.520 align:start position:0%
the summary sheet are clear they
 
00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
reference the amounts that will be saved
 
00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:11.220 align:start position:0%
by deleting those two House Bill 2
 
00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:12.529 align:start position:0%
by deleting those two House Bill 2
sections

00:29:12.529 --> 00:29:12.539 align:start position:0%
sections
 
00:29:15.529 --> 00:29:15.539 align:start position:0%
the third line uh reflects what would be
 
00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:17.640 align:start position:0%
a surplus statement adjustment on the
 
00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:19.500 align:start position:0%
legislature Surplus statement
 
00:29:21.049 --> 00:29:21.059 align:start position:0%
that would reflect a five million dollar
 
00:29:24.610 --> 00:29:24.620 align:start position:0%
savings in fiscal 24 by assuming that
 
00:29:27.169 --> 00:29:27.179 align:start position:0%
the hospital's contribution would reduce
 
00:29:29.269 --> 00:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
the transfer from liquor by five million
 
00:29:29.279 --> 00:29:30.590 align:start position:0%
the transfer from liquor by five million
dollars

00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:32.090 align:start position:0%
dollars
finally

00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:32.100 align:start position:0%
finally
 
00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:34.850 align:start position:0%
finally
because

00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:34.860 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:29:36.889 --> 00:29:36.899 align:start position:0%
granted Advantage would no longer
 
00:29:39.649 --> 00:29:39.659 align:start position:0%
receive liquor funds through the alcohol
 
00:29:42.289 --> 00:29:42.299 align:start position:0%
fund that that program would need a
 
00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:44.460 align:start position:0%
direct injection of liquor funds
 
00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:46.260 align:start position:0%
so that would be reflected on the
 
00:29:48.049 --> 00:29:48.059 align:start position:0%
Surplus statement as an 11 million
 
00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:50.820 align:start position:0%
dollar cost in fiscal 24. the reason
 
00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:52.740 align:start position:0%
we're only showing that in 24 is because
 
00:29:55.549 --> 00:29:55.559 align:start position:0%
as you know as of now granted Advantage
 
00:29:57.409 --> 00:29:57.419 align:start position:0%
is only real is only authorized through
 
00:29:59.389 --> 00:29:59.399 align:start position:0%
the end of this fiscal year if it were
 
00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:01.320 align:start position:0%
reauthorized there would need to be
 
00:30:03.889 --> 00:30:03.899 align:start position:0%
another 11 million dollar cost on the
 
00:30:06.169 --> 00:30:06.179 align:start position:0%
Surplus statement in fiscal 25. but for
 
00:30:08.330 --> 00:30:08.340 align:start position:0%
The house's current purposes it would be
 
00:30:10.909 --> 00:30:10.919 align:start position:0%
a single 11 million dollar hit
 
00:30:13.549 --> 00:30:13.559 align:start position:0%
so the net result if the committee were
 
00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
to adopt all of these changes would be a
 
00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:17.460 align:start position:0%
cost of roughly a million dollars over
 
00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
okay so this is too much to digest in
 
00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:29.340 align:start position:0%
just one thing so I I propose that
 
00:30:32.930 --> 00:30:32.940 align:start position:0%
um we we caucus on this in that we come
 
00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
back and we vote on the package and if
 
00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
the package doesn't succeed then we
 
00:30:40.549 --> 00:30:40.559 align:start position:0%
figure out which are the components that
 
00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
we can support
 
00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:49.010 --> 00:30:49.020 align:start position:0%
representative norgren okay one question
 
00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:52.260 align:start position:0%
uh representative Stringham um the the
 
00:30:54.409 --> 00:30:54.419 align:start position:0%
um no longer funding Granite State
 
00:30:57.409 --> 00:30:57.419 align:start position:0%
advantage through the alcohol fund
 
00:30:59.389 --> 00:30:59.399 align:start position:0%
um does that revert back if it's
 
00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
reinstated or is this meant to be a
 
00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
permanent change
 
00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.310 align:start position:0%
permanent change
and

00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:31:06.169 --> 00:31:06.179 align:start position:0%
this is meant to be a permanent change
 
00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
but granted Advantage would still be any
 
00:31:10.669 --> 00:31:10.679 align:start position:0%
shortfall in granted Advantage would
 
00:31:12.529 --> 00:31:12.539 align:start position:0%
still be funded with liquor funds that's
 
00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
current law so they just wouldn't pass
 
00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:16.860 align:start position:0%
through the governor's commission first
 
00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
so instead go to the general fund and
 
00:31:21.769 --> 00:31:21.779 align:start position:0%
then transfer over is that uh liquor
 
00:31:23.149 --> 00:31:23.159 align:start position:0%
funds would transfer to granted
 
00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
Advantage before going into the general
 
00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:28.140 align:start position:0%
fund thank you it also depends
 
00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
on what happens with the Bradley Bill to
 
00:31:33.769 --> 00:31:33.779 align:start position:0%
do Granite State Advantage extension
 
00:31:36.409 --> 00:31:36.419 align:start position:0%
right he's got three sources of funds
 
00:31:39.169 --> 00:31:39.179 align:start position:0%
that open up the transparency for
 
00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
funding the the that Medicaid expansion
 
00:31:45.049 --> 00:31:45.059 align:start position:0%
program so if that law passes then I
 
00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:46.440 align:start position:0%
think the answer is a little different
 
00:31:48.889 --> 00:31:48.899 align:start position:0%
than the one Mr Ripple just gave it's
 
00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:51.240 align:start position:0%
actually the same because Senate Bill
 
00:31:53.630 --> 00:31:53.640 align:start position:0%
263 has amended by the Senate actually
 
00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:55.370 align:start position:0%
263 has amended by the Senate actually
does

00:31:55.370 --> 00:31:55.380 align:start position:0%
does
 
00:31:58.010 --> 00:31:58.020 align:start position:0%
what you're trying to do here in 0974h
 
00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
it allows the alcohol fund to keep that
 
00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
five percent of liquor profits without
 
00:32:08.649 --> 00:32:08.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:16.250 --> 00:32:16.260 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
let's talk about Medicaid
 
00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
um is there do we have a sheet that
 
00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:22.260 align:start position:0%
shows us
 
00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:23.830 align:start position:0%
shows us
um

00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
recommendations on medic targeted
 
00:32:29.570 --> 00:32:29.580 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rates we there we got one from
 
00:32:31.789 --> 00:32:31.799 align:start position:0%
Mr Monahan
 
00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:34.020 align:start position:0%
um what what what did you intend for us
 
00:32:37.549 --> 00:32:37.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:39.409 --> 00:32:39.419 align:start position:0%
I have not printed out that sheet but I
 
00:32:41.029 --> 00:32:41.039 align:start position:0%
can I can do so if you'd like to talk
 
00:32:43.909 --> 00:32:43.919 align:start position:0%
about that now well I I think that's why
 
00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:45.720 align:start position:0%
Mr Lipman is here he's still here to
 
00:32:48.169 --> 00:32:48.179 align:start position:0%
talk about Medicaid I believe and if we
 
00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:51.480 align:start position:0%
can front load these discussions so that
 
00:32:53.690 --> 00:32:53.700 align:start position:0%
he feels comfortable even if he needs to
 
00:33:00.549 --> 00:33:00.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:03.889 --> 00:33:03.899 align:start position:0%
Miss Horgan does does that have that
 
00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:07.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:23.810 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:23.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:27.589 --> 00:34:27.599 align:start position:0%
okay so while he's making the copies I'm
 
00:34:30.349 --> 00:34:30.359 align:start position:0%
I'm going to tell the back story on on
 
00:34:33.109 --> 00:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
on some of what's been taking place
 
00:34:36.169 --> 00:34:36.179 align:start position:0%
everyone here knows that the governor is
 
00:34:38.889 --> 00:34:38.899 align:start position:0%
supporting a 3.1 percent Medicaid
 
00:34:42.730 --> 00:34:42.740 align:start position:0%
reimbursement increase across the board
 
00:34:46.669 --> 00:34:46.679 align:start position:0%
there's a 17 million dollar line item
 
00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:51.200 align:start position:0%
that that feeds that 3.1 percent
 
00:34:55.869 --> 00:34:55.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:55.879 --> 00:34:57.730 align:start position:0%
 
simultaneously

00:34:57.730 --> 00:34:57.740 align:start position:0%
simultaneously
 
00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
dealing with the bill introduced
 
00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
initially by Senator Rosenwald that said
 
00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:07.800 align:start position:0%
that that 17 million isn't enough we
 
00:35:10.609 --> 00:35:10.619 align:start position:0%
need to come up with 145 million more
 
00:35:13.609 --> 00:35:13.619 align:start position:0%
over the two years
 
00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:16.020 align:start position:0%
there was the senator Bradley amendment
 
00:35:18.829 --> 00:35:18.839 align:start position:0%
to that and what appears to be in strong
 
00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
position in the Senate
 
00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:26.220 align:start position:0%
is a proposal to spend 40 in each of the
 
00:35:29.450 --> 00:35:29.460 align:start position:0%
two years so instead of 145 I think the
 
00:35:33.589 --> 00:35:33.599 align:start position:0%
Bradley proposals at 80. for the two
 
00:35:33.599 --> 00:35:34.730 align:start position:0%
Bradley proposals at 80. for the two
years

00:35:34.730 --> 00:35:34.740 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:36.050 align:start position:0%
years
so

00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:36.060 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:38.700 align:start position:0%
that's what's going on there what what
 
00:35:43.609 --> 00:35:43.619 align:start position:0%
Mr Moynihan has done for us is he's
 
00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
coordinated with a number of
 
00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
stakeholders throughout our community
 
00:35:52.210 --> 00:35:52.220 align:start position:0%
rely on Medicaid reimbursement rates
 
00:35:57.349 --> 00:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
and uh he asked them uh I guess these
 
00:35:59.750 --> 00:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
were interactive meetings but he asked
 
00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:02.480 align:start position:0%
them to
 
00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:06.540 align:start position:0%
identify a targeted rate increase it
 
00:36:08.690 --> 00:36:08.700 align:start position:0%
wasn't a rate increase but a targeted
 
00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
amount of money that would keep them
 
00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
whole that that would keep them from
 
00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
basically shutting down in the next two
 
00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:19.320 align:start position:0%
years is the proposal is meant to be a
 
00:36:22.490 --> 00:36:22.500 align:start position:0%
minimum essential need request to sort
 
00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:25.020 align:start position:0%
of keep them going and if I say this
 
00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:27.720 align:start position:0%
wrong Miss Horgan you you're you know we
 
00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:31.140 align:start position:0%
have my permission to correct me am I
 
00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
right so far
 
00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:36.420 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so uh so what this
 
00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:39.480 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet does is it it takes sort of
 
00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
a collective wisdom of our Medicaid
 
00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:47.640 align:start position:0%
providers and informs us what they think
 
00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
they need to basically stay in business
 
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
so in the long-term care area the
 
00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
nursing homes the the notes talk about a
 
00:36:58.609 --> 00:36:58.619 align:start position:0%
15 rate increase
 
00:37:02.089 --> 00:37:02.099 align:start position:0%
and that translates into 16.5 million
 
00:37:05.329 --> 00:37:05.339 align:start position:0%
dollars in each of the two years that so
 
00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:07.800 align:start position:0%
that that's that's kind of an overall
 
00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
explanation of this spreadsheet and then
 
00:37:13.569 --> 00:37:13.579 align:start position:0%
that process and the notes are repeated
 
00:37:16.849 --> 00:37:16.859 align:start position:0%
throughout this spreadsheet
 
00:37:20.329 --> 00:37:20.339 align:start position:0%
um and they get to the bottom line
 
00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:23.640 align:start position:0%
which they uh it's basically a hundred
 
00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
hundred and technically it's a hundred
 
00:37:28.510 --> 00:37:28.520 align:start position:0%
Point fifty five and
 
00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
98.95 for the two years but it's easier
 
00:37:33.770 --> 00:37:33.780 align:start position:0%
for me to think of it as a hundred
 
00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:35.030 align:start position:0%
for me to think of it as a hundred
hundred

00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
hundred
 
00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:36.660 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
um and so so this is their re this is
 
00:37:42.050 --> 00:37:42.060 align:start position:0%
their request
 
00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:44.760 align:start position:0%
I think we've been open to the idea of
 
00:37:47.089 --> 00:37:47.099 align:start position:0%
providing some additional assistance to
 
00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
our to our Medicaid providers
 
00:37:53.089 --> 00:37:53.099 align:start position:0%
um the but the but this begins to make
 
00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
us think about exactly how much and
 
00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:00.180 align:start position:0%
where and how and so so this this will
 
00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
be the first time I think we've had this
 
00:38:05.089 --> 00:38:05.099 align:start position:0%
level of conversation but I think so far
 
00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
we've been aligned on the idea that we
 
00:38:09.589 --> 00:38:09.599 align:start position:0%
need to do something
 
00:38:11.569 --> 00:38:11.579 align:start position:0%
does does anyone disagree with that
 
00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
summary there that we have to do
 
00:38:15.890 --> 00:38:15.900 align:start position:0%
something right the question is how much
 
00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
and where
 
00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:18.720 align:start position:0%
representative norgren do you have a
 
00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
comment there or representative Waller
 
00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:32.290 align:start position:0%
comment there or representative Waller
Wallner

00:38:32.290 --> 00:38:32.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
this and and thank you and I'm so sorry
 
00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:38.460 align:start position:0%
had we not had that snowstorm you you'd
 
00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:40.980 align:start position:0%
already been out in front on this well I
 
00:38:42.770 --> 00:38:42.780 align:start position:0%
I was glad to spend a lot of time on
 
00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:45.480 align:start position:0%
this chart the day we were we were
 
00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
getting snowed in so uh and although
 
00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:51.290 align:start position:0%
getting snowed in so uh and although
um

00:38:51.290 --> 00:38:51.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:53.820 align:start position:0%
we could spend months digging into the
 
00:38:57.349 --> 00:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
details but before kind of going into
 
00:38:59.210 --> 00:38:59.220 align:start position:0%
um you know which which areas might have
 
00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
higher priority I think I think it might
 
00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:04.380 align:start position:0%
be useful just to talk about where the
 
00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
3.1 percent came from
 
00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
and um uh and why that's uh not an
 
00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
adequate number and maybe
 
00:39:16.069 --> 00:39:16.079 align:start position:0%
um we could uh you know win the 3.1
 
00:39:18.890 --> 00:39:18.900 align:start position:0%
percent was originally developed uh a
 
00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:21.240 align:start position:0%
lot of the current inflation figures
 
00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:23.460 align:start position:0%
weren't available and
 
00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:24.050 align:start position:0%
weren't available and
um

00:39:24.050 --> 00:39:24.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
um you know maybe we could just kind of
 
00:39:28.730 --> 00:39:28.740 align:start position:0%
start with that but if we just did
 
00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:31.980 align:start position:0%
inflation itself do you want to start
 
00:39:33.770 --> 00:39:33.780 align:start position:0%
with it or do you want Mr lippman to do
 
00:39:35.450 --> 00:39:35.460 align:start position:0%
that I would love Mr lippman to do it
 
00:39:37.609 --> 00:39:37.619 align:start position:0%
and then I could comment on it do you
 
00:39:39.109 --> 00:39:39.119 align:start position:0%
understand the request give us the
 
00:39:42.829 --> 00:39:42.839 align:start position:0%
history on the 3.1 yes we had a very
 
00:39:45.290 --> 00:39:45.300 align:start position:0%
brief conversation ahead of the meeting
 
00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
here uh you know in terms of the budget
 
00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:49.190 align:start position:0%
here uh you know in terms of the budget
process

00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:39:52.130 --> 00:39:52.140 align:start position:0%
we're almost like a year prior to you
 
00:39:54.530 --> 00:39:54.540 align:start position:0%
starting to really hone in on
 
00:39:55.849 --> 00:39:55.859 align:start position:0%
information when we're sort of
 
00:39:57.589 --> 00:39:57.599 align:start position:0%
developing our numbers and I think
 
00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:00.180 align:start position:0%
inflation has taken off the Staffing
 
00:40:03.410 --> 00:40:03.420 align:start position:0%
situations that Health Care Providers as
 
00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:04.849 align:start position:0%
situations that Health Care Providers as
uh

00:40:04.849 --> 00:40:04.859 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
Gone Gone worse not better you know the
 
00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
the length of time which
 
00:40:14.109 --> 00:40:14.119 align:start position:0%
hospitals and other home care
 
00:40:17.450 --> 00:40:17.460 align:start position:0%
agencies and the like nursing homes have
 
00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:19.800 align:start position:0%
had to to deal with uh the the
 
00:40:22.310 --> 00:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
consequences of working through the the
 
00:40:24.650 --> 00:40:24.660 align:start position:0%
infection issues that have affected us
 
00:40:27.470 --> 00:40:27.480 align:start position:0%
and the impacts on that
 
00:40:30.770 --> 00:40:30.780 align:start position:0%
um I think we were swamped by by that
 
00:40:32.930 --> 00:40:32.940 align:start position:0%
and what we did in developing our budget
 
00:40:36.109 --> 00:40:36.119 align:start position:0%
was to look at trying to be at the time
 
00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
be reasonable based on what something
 
00:40:40.370 --> 00:40:40.380 align:start position:0%
that the legislature previously had an
 
00:40:43.069 --> 00:40:43.079 align:start position:0%
appetite to to support and that was the
 
00:40:45.349 --> 00:40:45.359 align:start position:0%
the 3.1 percent
 
00:40:45.359 --> 00:40:45.950 align:start position:0%
the 3.1 percent
um

00:40:45.950 --> 00:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:48.109 --> 00:40:48.119 align:start position:0%
came from and that was consistent with
 
00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:51.240 align:start position:0%
what was done in 20 uh January of 20 and
 
00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:53.030 align:start position:0%
what was done in 20 uh January of 20 and
21.

00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
21.
 
00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
but I think you know we I think factors
 
00:40:58.010 --> 00:40:58.020 align:start position:0%
have swamped us since then
 
00:41:00.109 --> 00:41:00.119 align:start position:0%
yeah and I think you you uh you you
 
00:41:02.569 --> 00:41:02.579 align:start position:0%
mentioned that uh a couple of times the
 
00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
inflation index have been
 
00:41:07.730 --> 00:41:07.740 align:start position:0%
um revised at least your perception of
 
00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
that since since the 3.1 percent was
 
00:41:14.089 --> 00:41:14.099 align:start position:0%
done right and um and that the 145
 
00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:17.880 align:start position:0%
million uh increase was based on what 11
 
00:41:20.890 --> 00:41:20.900 align:start position:0%
was that correct
 
00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
representative could you please bring
 
00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
your microphone closer and talk into it
 
00:41:28.609 --> 00:41:28.619 align:start position:0%
I think people yeah I'll I'll try to eat
 
00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
it so the um uh I think the
 
00:41:37.849 --> 00:41:37.859 align:start position:0%
um my my question was the um uh the uh
 
00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:40.260 align:start position:0%
instead of the 34 million if you used a
 
00:41:42.010 --> 00:41:42.020 align:start position:0%
rate of 11
 
00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
uh you were dealing with something
 
00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:48.060 align:start position:0%
closer to 145 or 150 million is that
 
00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:51.480 align:start position:0%
correct from the Rosenwald uh bill
 
00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 86 as introduced at 145
 
00:41:56.510 --> 00:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
million over the biennium and that
 
00:42:01.010 --> 00:42:01.020 align:start position:0%
equated using 22 numbers to 11 increase
 
00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:05.400 align:start position:0%
on on services so applying that all
 
00:42:07.849 --> 00:42:07.859 align:start position:0%
those dollars to Services resulted in 11
 
00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:10.680 align:start position:0%
increase and that was a number we
 
00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:13.140 align:start position:0%
developed with our actuary
 
00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
foreign okay so is it fair to assume uh
 
00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:18.349 align:start position:0%
foreign okay so is it fair to assume uh
that

00:42:18.349 --> 00:42:18.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:42:21.589 --> 00:42:21.599 align:start position:0%
um uh if we provided the same mix of
 
00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
services and all the service codes
 
00:42:27.650 --> 00:42:27.660 align:start position:0%
and used two years ago as a base and
 
00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:30.900 align:start position:0%
then to now whether we used 11 no change
 
00:42:33.589 --> 00:42:33.599 align:start position:0%
in in service mix
 
00:42:36.410 --> 00:42:36.420 align:start position:0%
um that uh you know basically all those
 
00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:40.200 align:start position:0%
Services would be similarly uh stressed
 
00:42:44.089 --> 00:42:44.099 align:start position:0%
or or provided
 
00:42:45.890 --> 00:42:45.900 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I followed you all the way
 
00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
through I apologize um
 
00:42:51.410 --> 00:42:51.420 align:start position:0%
if you could just pass that out just a
 
00:42:53.450 --> 00:42:53.460 align:start position:0%
little bit more well I I guess I'm just
 
00:42:56.089 --> 00:42:56.099 align:start position:0%
saying with an 11 11 increase based on
 
00:42:58.069 --> 00:42:58.079 align:start position:0%
these new numbers right
 
00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:00.780 align:start position:0%
um and that uh
 
00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:03.240 align:start position:0%
uh and I'm not saying that whether those
 
00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
amount of funding is adequate or not
 
00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:09.240 align:start position:0%
adequate or overly adequate but we would
 
00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:12.900 align:start position:0%
just have kind of the same balance of
 
00:43:16.490 --> 00:43:16.500 align:start position:0%
um uh at that at that point we would be
 
00:43:18.609 --> 00:43:18.619 align:start position:0%
providing the same number of services
 
00:43:22.010 --> 00:43:22.020 align:start position:0%
within each of the benefit categories
 
00:43:24.770 --> 00:43:24.780 align:start position:0%
and so on and I hope that's helpful I
 
00:43:27.410 --> 00:43:27.420 align:start position:0%
think I think that's
 
00:43:31.210 --> 00:43:31.220 align:start position:0%
I think in using 22 right we have
 
00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
enrollment that's elevated currently
 
00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
using 22 numbers so I think that uh on a
 
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
net basis we we might expect and we
 
00:43:43.309 --> 00:43:43.319 align:start position:0%
would hope that some of the care that's
 
00:43:45.410 --> 00:43:45.420 align:start position:0%
not being delivered as a function of not
 
00:43:47.809 --> 00:43:47.819 align:start position:0%
having enough staff would probably
 
00:43:50.510 --> 00:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
come into play but the fact that we'd
 
00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:52.140 align:start position:0%
have lower enrollment would make that
 
00:43:55.130 --> 00:43:55.140 align:start position:0%
that adequate I mean not adequate but
 
00:43:56.750 --> 00:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
fall within that number
 
00:43:58.370 --> 00:43:58.380 align:start position:0%
and so you're saying you're going to
 
00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
have lower enrollment in the next two
 
00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:02.220 align:start position:0%
years than you've had in these two years
 
00:44:04.370 --> 00:44:04.380 align:start position:0%
correct because of the end of continuous
 
00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:07.309 align:start position:0%
correct because of the end of continuous
enrollment

00:44:07.309 --> 00:44:07.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:09.470 --> 00:44:09.480 align:start position:0%
and and what's the rough you have a
 
00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
rough figure for that yes so
 
00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:13.430 align:start position:0%
rough figure for that yes so
um

00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:14.930 align:start position:0%
um
pre

00:44:14.930 --> 00:44:14.940 align:start position:0%
pre
 
00:44:19.250 --> 00:44:19.260 align:start position:0%
um Federal action we're at about 178 000
 
00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:21.540 align:start position:0%
total enrollment today we're just over
 
00:44:26.690 --> 00:44:26.700 align:start position:0%
250 000. we are estimating based on our
 
00:44:30.770 --> 00:44:30.780 align:start position:0%
um on unwind uh plan that that will
 
00:44:33.710 --> 00:44:33.720 align:start position:0%
generate just itself approximately 60
 
00:44:36.349 --> 00:44:36.359 align:start position:0%
000 reduction and then sort of just the
 
00:44:39.290 --> 00:44:39.300 align:start position:0%
normal course of over the the next
 
00:44:41.870 --> 00:44:41.880 align:start position:0%
following year we expect to start to
 
00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:43.130 align:start position:0%
following year we expect to start to
approach

00:44:43.130 --> 00:44:43.140 align:start position:0%
approach
 
00:44:44.809 --> 00:44:44.819 align:start position:0%
um you know where we were you know
 
00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
economic circumstances I think somewhere
 
00:44:50.030 --> 00:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
between 178 and 190 is probably you know
 
00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
a pretty reasonable settling Point based
 
00:44:54.170 --> 00:44:54.180 align:start position:0%
on what we understand
 
00:44:56.870 --> 00:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
so when you were providing some of this
 
00:44:59.410 --> 00:44:59.420 align:start position:0%
summary tables and I think was roughly
 
00:45:02.690 --> 00:45:02.700 align:start position:0%
555 million of
 
00:45:05.329 --> 00:45:05.339 align:start position:0%
uh funds from the general funds to fund
 
00:45:08.089 --> 00:45:08.099 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid Program you were basing
 
00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
that on 2018 and the reason for that is
 
00:45:13.370 --> 00:45:13.380 align:start position:0%
is that related to this because you
 
00:45:15.530 --> 00:45:15.540 align:start position:0%
think the numbers are more equivalent to
 
00:45:19.309 --> 00:45:19.319 align:start position:0%
where we were in 2000 I think it was 18.
 
00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
um so when we
 
00:45:23.930 --> 00:45:23.940 align:start position:0%
we were doing the sort of the fiscal
 
00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
analysis for
 
00:45:29.630 --> 00:45:29.640 align:start position:0%
um the the proposed 145 million over the
 
00:45:31.370 --> 00:45:31.380 align:start position:0%
biennium we looked at two years we
 
00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
looked at calendar 19 because that was a
 
00:45:38.210 --> 00:45:38.220 align:start position:0%
year that was completed before any covid
 
00:45:40.670 --> 00:45:40.680 align:start position:0%
considerations would have to be made and
 
00:45:43.730 --> 00:45:43.740 align:start position:0%
then we looked at 22 our state fiscal
 
00:45:46.309 --> 00:45:46.319 align:start position:0%
year 22. so we kind of developed sort of
 
00:45:48.170 --> 00:45:48.180 align:start position:0%
a range and they're within two percent
 
00:45:50.750 --> 00:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
of each other in terms of what the the
 
00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
expectation is you know certain services
 
00:45:57.470 --> 00:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
have suppressed other services you know
 
00:45:57.480 --> 00:45:58.130 align:start position:0%
have suppressed other services you know
um

00:45:58.130 --> 00:45:58.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:00.710 --> 00:46:00.720 align:start position:0%
have continued so it's it's seeing those
 
00:46:04.250 --> 00:46:04.260 align:start position:0%
services that come back that uh
 
00:46:06.349 --> 00:46:06.359 align:start position:0%
um you know our budget numbers also
 
00:46:06.359 --> 00:46:07.849 align:start position:0%
um you know our budget numbers also
reflect

00:46:07.849 --> 00:46:07.859 align:start position:0%
reflect
 
00:46:09.770 --> 00:46:09.780 align:start position:0%
um you know medical inflation of three
 
00:46:13.309 --> 00:46:13.319 align:start position:0%
percent in in what we propose to you in
 
00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:15.240 align:start position:0%
the um the agency and I think the
 
00:46:17.390 --> 00:46:17.400 align:start position:0%
governor's phase there
 
00:46:19.609 --> 00:46:19.619 align:start position:0%
I just want to do a time check here
 
00:46:21.349 --> 00:46:21.359 align:start position:0%
because I've been told that the
 
00:46:23.210 --> 00:46:23.220 align:start position:0%
Democrats have a caucus at some point
 
00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
that's coming up very soon
 
00:46:29.329 --> 00:46:29.339 align:start position:0%
at noon okay all right keep going
 
00:46:32.210 --> 00:46:32.220 align:start position:0%
so by three percent medical inflation is
 
00:46:33.950 --> 00:46:33.960 align:start position:0%
that uh Could you
 
00:46:36.770 --> 00:46:36.780 align:start position:0%
um Define that for us so that would be
 
00:46:38.569 --> 00:46:38.579 align:start position:0%
things like new
 
00:46:38.579 --> 00:46:39.730 align:start position:0%
things like new
um

00:46:39.730 --> 00:46:39.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:42.730 --> 00:46:42.740 align:start position:0%
drugs or therapies
 
00:46:45.230 --> 00:46:45.240 align:start position:0%
that would reflect
 
00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:45.890 align:start position:0%
that would reflect
um

00:46:45.890 --> 00:46:45.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:48.190 --> 00:46:48.200 align:start position:0%
you know we're going to see potentially
 
00:46:50.589 --> 00:46:50.599 align:start position:0%
the people who will leave the program
 
00:46:54.290 --> 00:46:54.300 align:start position:0%
will be generally have lower lower
 
00:46:56.210 --> 00:46:56.220 align:start position:0%
Acuity or will have lower Acuity than
 
00:46:58.309 --> 00:46:58.319 align:start position:0%
those that remain and so there's a
 
00:47:01.010 --> 00:47:01.020 align:start position:0%
factor there you know basically
 
00:47:04.910 --> 00:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
um we've been able to manage the program
 
00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:07.190 align:start position:0%
um we've been able to manage the program
with

00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:07.849 align:start position:0%
with
um

00:47:07.849 --> 00:47:07.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:10.190 --> 00:47:10.200 align:start position:0%
focusing on quality and utilization to
 
00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:12.720 align:start position:0%
kind of be beat inflation if you will in
 
00:47:14.510 --> 00:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
terms of medical inflation anyways but
 
00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
that's you know we do we do practically
 
00:47:18.829 --> 00:47:18.839 align:start position:0%
do see some that we can't overcome
 
00:47:20.450 --> 00:47:20.460 align:start position:0%
through those factors each year so
 
00:47:22.010 --> 00:47:22.020 align:start position:0%
that's that's where the three percent
 
00:47:24.050 --> 00:47:24.060 align:start position:0%
comes from
 
00:47:26.809 --> 00:47:26.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
so I I just want to go back to my my my
 
00:47:34.730 --> 00:47:34.740 align:start position:0%
planning boundary conditions around this
 
00:47:37.010 --> 00:47:37.020 align:start position:0%
so that people know where I'm coming
 
00:47:39.589 --> 00:47:39.599 align:start position:0%
from and they can just disagree or agree
 
00:47:42.050 --> 00:47:42.060 align:start position:0%
with this direction
 
00:47:46.970 --> 00:47:46.980 align:start position:0%
what I think we ought to do is just take
 
00:47:50.329 --> 00:47:50.339 align:start position:0%
the 3.1 percent as the floor the the
 
00:47:50.339 --> 00:47:51.530 align:start position:0%
the 3.1 percent as the floor the the
base

00:47:51.530 --> 00:47:51.540 align:start position:0%
base
 
00:47:55.790 --> 00:47:55.800 align:start position:0%
and then do a targeted rate increase
 
00:47:58.609 --> 00:47:58.619 align:start position:0%
and then the question is questions
 
00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
become how much
 
00:48:03.290 --> 00:48:03.300 align:start position:0%
I've answered that question by saying 40
 
00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
million per year because that's
 
00:48:07.730 --> 00:48:07.740 align:start position:0%
consistent with what the Senate seems to
 
00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:11.400 align:start position:0%
be coming up with and I I just soon aim
 
00:48:13.490 --> 00:48:13.500 align:start position:0%
at what they may be aiming at
 
00:48:18.290 --> 00:48:18.300 align:start position:0%
and then this proposal from Monahan
 
00:48:21.470 --> 00:48:21.480 align:start position:0%
um and the and the community is an
 
00:48:24.109 --> 00:48:24.119 align:start position:0%
opportunity for us to discuss how to
 
00:48:26.809 --> 00:48:26.819 align:start position:0%
allocate it or spread it now you and I
 
00:48:29.390 --> 00:48:29.400 align:start position:0%
have not had an opportunity to discuss
 
00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:30.589 align:start position:0%
have not had an opportunity to discuss
this

00:48:30.589 --> 00:48:30.599 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:32.640 align:start position:0%
because I I don't know what sort of work
 
00:48:34.309 --> 00:48:34.319 align:start position:0%
product that you may have been
 
00:48:35.930 --> 00:48:35.940 align:start position:0%
developing for us because you've been
 
00:48:38.450 --> 00:48:38.460 align:start position:0%
working this project for a while to
 
00:48:42.530 --> 00:48:42.540 align:start position:0%
recommend targeted rate increases and so
 
00:48:45.770 --> 00:48:45.780 align:start position:0%
I I'm just curious if this sheet from Mr
 
00:48:49.069 --> 00:48:49.079 align:start position:0%
Monahan is useful to what you were
 
00:48:50.809 --> 00:48:50.819 align:start position:0%
working on or do you have something
 
00:48:54.890 --> 00:48:54.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:57.290 --> 00:48:57.300 align:start position:0%
um first of all I do think it's it's
 
00:48:58.970 --> 00:48:58.980 align:start position:0%
very useful
 
00:49:01.069 --> 00:49:01.079 align:start position:0%
um I do think I do agree that the issue
 
00:49:02.510 --> 00:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
of how much
 
00:49:05.329 --> 00:49:05.339 align:start position:0%
how much needs to go for overall
 
00:49:05.339 --> 00:49:05.930 align:start position:0%
how much needs to go for overall
um

00:49:05.930 --> 00:49:05.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:09.050 --> 00:49:09.060 align:start position:0%
uh you know to the Medicaid Program from
 
00:49:12.109 --> 00:49:12.119 align:start position:0%
General funds uh is an issue
 
00:49:13.730 --> 00:49:13.740 align:start position:0%
um you know where I am based on what
 
00:49:15.290 --> 00:49:15.300 align:start position:0%
I've seen
 
00:49:19.250 --> 00:49:19.260 align:start position:0%
um 17 and 40 per year is not enough
 
00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:20.630 align:start position:0%
um 17 and 40 per year is not enough
so

00:49:20.630 --> 00:49:20.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
um this sheet that minahan provided
 
00:49:25.550 --> 00:49:25.560 align:start position:0%
still doesn't cover durable medical
 
00:49:28.250 --> 00:49:28.260 align:start position:0%
equipment or Pharmacy which are two
 
00:49:30.589 --> 00:49:30.599 align:start position:0%
additional benefit categories that
 
00:49:32.990 --> 00:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
probably are going to need something
 
00:49:35.569 --> 00:49:35.579 align:start position:0%
and um uh
 
00:49:37.790 --> 00:49:37.800 align:start position:0%
and you know I think I think even even
 
00:49:40.970 --> 00:49:40.980 align:start position:0%
114 doesn't get us a system
 
00:49:43.250 --> 00:49:43.260 align:start position:0%
delivering the same
 
00:49:47.809 --> 00:49:47.819 align:start position:0%
uh same amount as we are right now I do
 
00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
think these allocations and you know I
 
00:49:52.190 --> 00:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
think the governor challenged us to
 
00:49:55.010 --> 00:49:55.020 align:start position:0%
maybe have priorities that's that's kind
 
00:49:58.670 --> 00:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
of a separate discussion but um uh you
 
00:50:02.569 --> 00:50:02.579 align:start position:0%
know I I think targeting 200 is is a a
 
00:50:05.450 --> 00:50:05.460 align:start position:0%
better way to go is probably going to
 
00:50:08.510 --> 00:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
get us uh some some better services for
 
00:50:11.569 --> 00:50:11.579 align:start position:0%
for our citizens okay so
 
00:50:14.870 --> 00:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
um I just want to clean up a a a a a a
 
00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:16.970 align:start position:0%
um I just want to clean up a a a a a a
factoid

00:50:16.970 --> 00:50:16.980 align:start position:0%
factoid
 
00:50:20.809 --> 00:50:20.819 align:start position:0%
the 17 million is the base this 40 would
 
00:50:22.970 --> 00:50:22.980 align:start position:0%
be on top of it so if we did both it
 
00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
would be 57. 114 for two years
 
00:50:30.109 --> 00:50:30.119 align:start position:0%
114 for two years right
 
00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
57 and 57. yeah so so
 
00:50:38.210 --> 00:50:38.220 align:start position:0%
um so maybe
 
00:50:41.450 --> 00:50:41.460 align:start position:0%
maybe rather than discussing the
 
00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
debating the dollar amount whether it
 
00:50:48.829 --> 00:50:48.839 align:start position:0%
should be this 57 per year or 145 or 200
 
00:50:51.950 --> 00:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
rather than debating that right now
 
00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
would we make any progress if we could
 
00:50:58.190 --> 00:50:58.200 align:start position:0%
at least identify
 
00:51:00.290 --> 00:51:00.300 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:51:02.870 --> 00:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
those items that we would want to Target
 
00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
within increases would you would you
 
00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
would you think that we should continue
 
00:51:10.970 --> 00:51:10.980 align:start position:0%
to Target or attempt to Target or
 
00:51:13.790 --> 00:51:13.800 align:start position:0%
would you just take your 200 for example
 
00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:18.720 align:start position:0%
and continue to spread it evenly
 
00:51:20.930 --> 00:51:20.940 align:start position:0%
well I I think it's important to look at
 
00:51:25.390 --> 00:51:25.400 align:start position:0%
the line items so that we understand why
 
00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:28.200 align:start position:0%
the need is there
 
00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:30.290 align:start position:0%
the need is there
um

00:51:30.290 --> 00:51:30.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:33.900 align:start position:0%
you know I I don't know how how much uh
 
00:51:36.410 --> 00:51:36.420 align:start position:0%
as a group will want to direct
 
00:51:40.370 --> 00:51:40.380 align:start position:0%
um the department uh to specific uh
 
00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
codes and and benefit categories
 
00:51:46.069 --> 00:51:46.079 align:start position:0%
um but I do think it's important for us
 
00:51:49.849 --> 00:51:49.859 align:start position:0%
to discuss why some of them may have
 
00:51:52.790 --> 00:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
more impact on our citizen citizenry
 
00:51:55.010 --> 00:51:55.020 align:start position:0%
than others but
 
00:51:58.970 --> 00:51:58.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:04.130 --> 00:52:04.140 align:start position:0%
well I really think we should use the um
 
00:52:06.589 --> 00:52:06.599 align:start position:0%
information that was provided to us by
 
00:52:09.109 --> 00:52:09.119 align:start position:0%
the provider groups I mean they know
 
00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:11.880 align:start position:0%
their services and they know
 
00:52:15.650 --> 00:52:15.660 align:start position:0%
better than we do what what they need in
 
00:52:18.290 --> 00:52:18.300 align:start position:0%
order to stay viable
 
00:52:20.809 --> 00:52:20.819 align:start position:0%
um and so I would want to use this as as
 
00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
a guide guide for how we do it I
 
00:52:28.609 --> 00:52:28.619 align:start position:0%
um don't have any way of myself making
 
00:52:31.790 --> 00:52:31.800 align:start position:0%
decisions about whether one
 
00:52:34.910 --> 00:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
service is worthy more than another
 
00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:37.010 align:start position:0%
service is worthy more than another
service

00:52:37.010 --> 00:52:37.020 align:start position:0%
service
 
00:52:39.829 --> 00:52:39.839 align:start position:0%
but it seems to me that
 
00:52:42.109 --> 00:52:42.119 align:start position:0%
you know the three percent is just way
 
00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:45.480 align:start position:0%
too low that that just does not work
 
00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:46.190 align:start position:0%
too low that that just does not work
um

00:52:46.190 --> 00:52:46.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:48.370 --> 00:52:48.380 align:start position:0%
the 11 percent
 
00:52:55.309 --> 00:52:55.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:55.319 --> 00:52:57.290 align:start position:0%
 
is

00:52:57.290 --> 00:52:57.300 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
you know even even from the time that we
 
00:53:03.349 --> 00:53:03.359 align:start position:0%
filed legislation
 
00:53:05.210 --> 00:53:05.220 align:start position:0%
a lot has happened
 
00:53:08.270 --> 00:53:08.280 align:start position:0%
and I think the providers have provided
 
00:53:10.549 --> 00:53:10.559 align:start position:0%
us with the information of what they
 
00:53:12.829 --> 00:53:12.839 align:start position:0%
really feel they need
 
00:53:15.250 --> 00:53:15.260 align:start position:0%
and I would use that as my guidance
 
00:53:18.170 --> 00:53:18.180 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler
 
00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
I might have missed something at the
 
00:53:23.390 --> 00:53:23.400 align:start position:0%
beginning but is this a proposal we're
 
00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
looking at all new money or Does it
 
00:53:28.309 --> 00:53:28.319 align:start position:0%
include present rates or Does it include
 
00:53:32.150 --> 00:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
the 3.1 percent or what is it all just
 
00:53:34.849 --> 00:53:34.859 align:start position:0%
I'm going to look to miss Horgan to
 
00:53:37.970 --> 00:53:37.980 align:start position:0%
shake her head I I think this is uh
 
00:53:40.490 --> 00:53:40.500 align:start position:0%
incremental money assuming the 3.1
 
00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
percent is uh is implemented
 
00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:46.010 align:start position:0%
percent is uh is implemented
yes

00:53:46.010 --> 00:53:46.020 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:53:47.450 --> 00:53:47.460 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:53:51.170 --> 00:53:51.180 align:start position:0%
representative I just wanted to add that
 
00:53:54.170 --> 00:53:54.180 align:start position:0%
um I found this document extremely
 
00:53:56.089 --> 00:53:56.099 align:start position:0%
um educational
 
00:53:56.099 --> 00:53:57.650 align:start position:0%
um educational
and

00:53:57.650 --> 00:53:57.660 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:54:01.130 --> 00:54:01.140 align:start position:0%
um the fact that the hospitals
 
00:54:05.930 --> 00:54:05.940 align:start position:0%
are seeing the value of passing at
 
00:54:08.450 --> 00:54:08.460 align:start position:0%
minimum their three percent
 
00:54:12.650 --> 00:54:12.660 align:start position:0%
on to others uh in particular Community
 
00:54:15.410 --> 00:54:15.420 align:start position:0%
providers with emphasis on long-term
 
00:54:17.569 --> 00:54:17.579 align:start position:0%
care and mental health I think that
 
00:54:21.530 --> 00:54:21.540 align:start position:0%
speaks volumes to the task at hand here
 
00:54:21.540 --> 00:54:23.390 align:start position:0%
speaks volumes to the task at hand here
that

00:54:23.390 --> 00:54:23.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:54:27.290 --> 00:54:27.300 align:start position:0%
not everything is equal it's not Apples
 
00:54:30.410 --> 00:54:30.420 align:start position:0%
to Apples and the the industry and the
 
00:54:33.170 --> 00:54:33.180 align:start position:0%
players have identified that and so I
 
00:54:34.970 --> 00:54:34.980 align:start position:0%
would hope that we could take that as
 
00:54:37.910 --> 00:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
guidance and invest in the areas that
 
00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:39.049 align:start position:0%
guidance and invest in the areas that
will

00:54:39.049 --> 00:54:39.059 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:54:41.030 --> 00:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
um also benefit
 
00:54:43.309 --> 00:54:43.319 align:start position:0%
um the hospitals and and other people
 
00:54:45.829 --> 00:54:45.839 align:start position:0%
who have decided to or have
 
00:54:48.109 --> 00:54:48.119 align:start position:0%
suggested that we forgo their three
 
00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
percent or more I'm gonna Echo your
 
00:54:53.089 --> 00:54:53.099 align:start position:0%
compliment to the hospital Association
 
00:54:56.809 --> 00:54:56.819 align:start position:0%
but I just want to clarify a granular
 
00:54:59.630 --> 00:54:59.640 align:start position:0%
element of it and that is
 
00:55:02.270 --> 00:55:02.280 align:start position:0%
um since this document is meant to be
 
00:55:05.270 --> 00:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
incremental above the 3.1 percent I I
 
00:55:07.790 --> 00:55:07.800 align:start position:0%
think there the hospital is is expecting
 
00:55:09.890 --> 00:55:09.900 align:start position:0%
their 3.1 percent
 
00:55:12.410 --> 00:55:12.420 align:start position:0%
but this would be so they don't even
 
00:55:16.849 --> 00:55:16.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:19.069 --> 00:55:19.079 align:start position:0%
so so when we first said this was all
 
00:55:21.829 --> 00:55:21.839 align:start position:0%
incremental assuming the 3.1 percent was
 
00:55:23.809 --> 00:55:23.819 align:start position:0%
implemented this is actually an
 
00:55:28.849 --> 00:55:28.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:33.170 --> 00:55:33.180 align:start position:0%
well okay so so my question there is
 
00:55:36.470 --> 00:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
of the hospital allocation of the 3.1
 
00:55:39.849 --> 00:55:39.859 align:start position:0%
percent how many dollars is that
 
00:55:42.670 --> 00:55:42.680 align:start position:0%
go ahead Nathan I want to know right now
 
00:55:47.150 --> 00:55:47.160 align:start position:0%
what what is 3.1 percent of the hospital
 
00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:48.609 align:start position:0%
what what is 3.1 percent of the hospital
share

00:55:48.609 --> 00:55:48.619 align:start position:0%
share
 
00:55:51.290 --> 00:55:51.300 align:start position:0%
uh in dollar amounts
 
00:55:53.329 --> 00:55:53.339 align:start position:0%
I I know that's going to take his time
 
00:55:55.730 --> 00:55:55.740 align:start position:0%
I'm just joking a little bit but but
 
00:55:58.069 --> 00:55:58.079 align:start position:0%
thank you because I I didn't assume that
 
00:56:00.349 --> 00:56:00.359 align:start position:0%
I I thought it was Noble that they were
 
00:56:02.569 --> 00:56:02.579 align:start position:0%
looking to spread the wealth but go
 
00:56:04.430 --> 00:56:04.440 align:start position:0%
ahead well I I understood when I looked
 
00:56:06.290 --> 00:56:06.300 align:start position:0%
at this they were looking to spread the
 
00:56:09.049 --> 00:56:09.059 align:start position:0%
wealth of their 3.1 percent that was
 
00:56:10.730 --> 00:56:10.740 align:start position:0%
being allocated to them and you were
 
00:56:12.710 --> 00:56:12.720 align:start position:0%
right I I just have never known any
 
00:56:15.710 --> 00:56:15.720 align:start position:0%
entity ever forgo money and that is why
 
00:56:18.049 --> 00:56:18.059 align:start position:0%
I wanted to point it out was that
 
00:56:20.630 --> 00:56:20.640 align:start position:0%
they're looking at the big picture and
 
00:56:22.010 --> 00:56:22.020 align:start position:0%
the overall
 
00:56:24.170 --> 00:56:24.180 align:start position:0%
um the whole environment of Health Care
 
00:56:25.849 --> 00:56:25.859 align:start position:0%
here in the state and how to better
 
00:56:27.470 --> 00:56:27.480 align:start position:0%
provide care
 
00:56:29.569 --> 00:56:29.579 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman go ahead representative
 
00:56:32.690 --> 00:56:32.700 align:start position:0%
according to page uh I think it's 50
 
00:56:35.390 --> 00:56:35.400 align:start position:0%
from last page of our division of
 
00:56:38.329 --> 00:56:38.339 align:start position:0%
Medicaid services hospital inpatient was
 
00:56:42.589 --> 00:56:42.599 align:start position:0%
130 million including Granite State on
 
00:56:46.010 --> 00:56:46.020 align:start position:0%
Hospital outpatient is 213 million for a
 
00:56:49.130 --> 00:56:49.140 align:start position:0%
total of 343 million
 
00:56:52.549 --> 00:56:52.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:56.030 --> 00:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
6.1 percent would be about 9 million uh
 
00:56:57.710 --> 00:56:57.720 align:start position:0%
I believe so um so that's fee for
 
00:56:59.870 --> 00:56:59.880 align:start position:0%
service and Managed Care Medicare I'm
 
00:57:02.049 --> 00:57:02.059 align:start position:0%
sorry those were those
 
00:57:05.030 --> 00:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
out of about you know roughly 2 billion
 
00:57:07.490 --> 00:57:07.500 align:start position:0%
of totals I think we have and the answer
 
00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:10.190 align:start position:0%
of totals I think we have and the answer
is

00:57:10.190 --> 00:57:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:15.190 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:57:15.190 --> 00:57:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:17.470 --> 00:57:17.480 align:start position:0%
confirming representative bringham
 
00:57:21.109 --> 00:57:21.119 align:start position:0%
strength sorry is the 130 and the 213
 
00:57:23.809 --> 00:57:23.819 align:start position:0%
was was the correct numbers for
 
00:57:26.569 --> 00:57:26.579 align:start position:0%
um 2022 2022
 
00:57:29.329 --> 00:57:29.339 align:start position:0%
and so um I'll just do the 3.1 percent
 
00:57:31.790 --> 00:57:31.800 align:start position:0%
on that in a second here
 
00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:32.990 align:start position:0%
on that in a second here
so

00:57:32.990 --> 00:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:57:34.790 --> 00:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
um you know the hospitals aren't being
 
00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:36.890 align:start position:0%
um you know the hospitals aren't being
entirely

00:57:36.890 --> 00:57:36.900 align:start position:0%
entirely
 
00:57:39.309 --> 00:57:39.319 align:start position:0%
um uh generous
 
00:57:42.710 --> 00:57:42.720 align:start position:0%
just just just to be nice or to make the
 
00:57:45.109 --> 00:57:45.119 align:start position:0%
system work better they're they're being
 
00:57:45.119 --> 00:57:46.910 align:start position:0%
system work better they're they're being
financially

00:57:46.910 --> 00:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
financially
 
00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:50.640 align:start position:0%
um damaged by having to have patients
 
00:57:54.230 --> 00:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
stay in the hospital use up a bed get no
 
00:57:57.170 --> 00:57:57.180 align:start position:0%
money for it virtually and not be able
 
00:57:59.030 --> 00:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
to bring in a paying patient
 
00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:00.589 align:start position:0%
to bring in a paying patient
so

00:58:00.589 --> 00:58:00.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:58:04.250 --> 00:58:04.260 align:start position:0%
um uh because uh in particular I think
 
00:58:06.530 --> 00:58:06.540 align:start position:0%
their testimony was that that two other
 
00:58:09.170 --> 00:58:09.180 align:start position:0%
systems the nursing home system and the
 
00:58:11.450 --> 00:58:11.460 align:start position:0%
Home Health Care home health aid type
 
00:58:15.290 --> 00:58:15.300 align:start position:0%
systems weren't robust enough for them
 
00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
to operate at full efficiency so they're
 
00:58:20.329 --> 00:58:20.339 align:start position:0%
saying uh
 
00:58:22.430 --> 00:58:22.440 align:start position:0%
um if you help them you'll be helping us
 
00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:24.530 align:start position:0%
um if you help them you'll be helping us
and

00:58:24.530 --> 00:58:24.540 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:58:26.690 --> 00:58:26.700 align:start position:0%
um why that why any money that would be
 
00:58:29.030 --> 00:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
available to them would still come to
 
00:58:30.710 --> 00:58:30.720 align:start position:0%
them if you give it to these other
 
00:58:33.049 --> 00:58:33.059 align:start position:0%
sources so
 
00:58:33.059 --> 00:58:33.770 align:start position:0%
sources so
um

00:58:33.770 --> 00:58:33.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:33.780 --> 00:58:35.089 align:start position:0%
um
uh

00:58:35.089 --> 00:58:35.099 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:58:37.609 --> 00:58:37.619 align:start position:0%
you know with with the uh amount of
 
00:58:40.309 --> 00:58:40.319 align:start position:0%
funds that we have about available uh
 
00:58:41.930 --> 00:58:41.940 align:start position:0%
you know they've done a great service to
 
00:58:44.210 --> 00:58:44.220 align:start position:0%
point us in the in those directions
 
00:58:44.220 --> 00:58:45.650 align:start position:0%
point us in the in those directions
so

00:58:45.650 --> 00:58:45.660 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:58:47.690 --> 00:58:47.700 align:start position:0%
I I preferred the fantasy they were
 
00:58:50.450 --> 00:58:50.460 align:start position:0%
being Noble but thank you for reality uh
 
00:58:52.730 --> 00:58:52.740 align:start position:0%
Mr Lemon do you have a number four 10.6
 
00:58:56.510 --> 00:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
million 10.6 million 10.6
 
00:58:58.250 --> 00:58:58.260 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
00:59:00.710 --> 00:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
so just just to keep my numbers
 
00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:02.569 align:start position:0%
so just just to keep my numbers
consistent

00:59:02.569 --> 00:59:02.579 align:start position:0%
consistent
 
00:59:06.710 --> 00:59:06.720 align:start position:0%
per year if if they're with that 10.6
 
00:59:08.990 --> 00:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
plus the 40 million
 
00:59:13.069 --> 00:59:13.079 align:start position:0%
then just the add-on I think that we
 
00:59:15.890 --> 00:59:15.900 align:start position:0%
could do within this spreadsheet I I
 
00:59:17.470 --> 00:59:17.480 align:start position:0%
would aim at
 
00:59:21.170 --> 00:59:21.180 align:start position:0%
50.6 million and and you're
 
00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:24.180 align:start position:0%
probably four times greater than that so
 
00:59:26.750 --> 00:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
but but I just I just wanted to at least
 
00:59:29.930 --> 00:59:29.940 align:start position:0%
tell you what that did to my numbers
 
00:59:34.130 --> 00:59:34.140 align:start position:0%
no no I I'm I would still I would add
 
00:59:37.849 --> 00:59:37.859 align:start position:0%
the 17 million to that 50.6 million I'm
 
00:59:40.069 --> 00:59:40.079 align:start position:0%
not I haven't been adding it okay I'm
 
00:59:42.170 --> 00:59:42.180 align:start position:0%
not interested in adding it really
 
00:59:44.150 --> 00:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
because the 17 million is already
 
00:59:46.130 --> 00:59:46.140 align:start position:0%
assumed to be in there we're not we're
 
00:59:47.329 --> 00:59:47.339 align:start position:0%
not debating
 
00:59:51.950 --> 00:59:51.960 align:start position:0%
the 17's in there unless well wait a
 
00:59:55.490 --> 00:59:55.500 align:start position:0%
second let me let me the let me tell you
 
00:59:59.589 --> 00:59:59.599 align:start position:0%
what we would have to take the hospitals
 
01:00:03.170 --> 01:00:03.180 align:start position:0%
go ahead if if we had 100 million per
 
01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:04.250 align:start position:0%
go ahead if if we had 100 million per
year

01:00:04.250 --> 01:00:04.260 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:00:06.950 --> 01:00:06.960 align:start position:0%
with 17 million would come from the
 
01:00:09.230 --> 01:00:09.240 align:start position:0%
amount that's already in hb2
 
01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
so we have another 40 million this is
 
01:00:13.849 --> 01:00:13.859 align:start position:0%
another 10. so we're looking for another
 
01:00:22.370 --> 01:00:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:24.170 --> 01:00:24.180 align:start position:0%
well you wouldn't have the seven total
 
01:00:26.569 --> 01:00:26.579 align:start position:0%
17 if you're other if you double time
 
01:00:29.569 --> 01:00:29.579 align:start position:0%
the 10.6 you have the 17 as well right
 
01:00:31.730 --> 01:00:31.740 align:start position:0%
the 10.6 subtracts from the 17 doesn't
 
01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:34.549 align:start position:0%
the 10.6 subtracts from the 17 doesn't
it

01:00:34.549 --> 01:00:34.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:36.829 --> 01:00:36.839 align:start position:0%
I think what I'm trying to explore is if
 
01:00:40.130 --> 01:00:40.140 align:start position:0%
that 10.6 from the hospital would is
 
01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
part of that 17 million
 
01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:46.319 align:start position:0%
right and so Mr Ripple shaking has said
 
01:00:46.319 --> 01:00:49.069 align:start position:0%
right and so Mr Ripple shaking has said
yes

01:00:49.069 --> 01:00:49.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:51.049 --> 01:00:51.059 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding I think if you
 
01:00:53.450 --> 01:00:53.460 align:start position:0%
were to take out the 10.6 million for my
 
01:00:55.190 --> 01:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the 10.6 million
 
01:00:57.410 --> 01:00:57.420 align:start position:0%
is included in that 17 figure so if you
 
01:00:59.089 --> 01:00:59.099 align:start position:0%
did not want to provide the 3.1 percent
 
01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
to hospitals that 17 could come down to
 
01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:05.870 align:start position:0%
to hospitals that 17 could come down to
6.4

01:01:05.870 --> 01:01:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:08.809 --> 01:01:08.819 align:start position:0%
go ahead Mr lippman
 
01:01:11.089 --> 01:01:11.099 align:start position:0%
so I guess one other
 
01:01:14.990 --> 01:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
um tweak here is that the while the 130
 
01:01:17.210 --> 01:01:17.220 align:start position:0%
and the 213 is correct the the granite
 
01:01:20.329 --> 01:01:20.339 align:start position:0%
Advantage component wouldn't be in that
 
01:01:20.339 --> 01:01:21.289 align:start position:0%
Advantage component wouldn't be in that
that

01:01:21.289 --> 01:01:21.299 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:01:24.349 --> 01:01:24.359 align:start position:0%
um that's another sub-calculation that
 
01:01:26.089 --> 01:01:26.099 align:start position:0%
we need to make here
 
01:01:27.589 --> 01:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
and just to confirm since I'm not
 
01:01:29.089 --> 01:01:29.099 align:start position:0%
looking at that page in the handout I
 
01:01:30.289 --> 01:01:30.299 align:start position:0%
don't have it up in front of me that
 
01:01:32.809 --> 01:01:32.819 align:start position:0%
combined 343 million from which you got
 
01:01:35.210 --> 01:01:35.220 align:start position:0%
the 10.6 that's all General funds that
 
01:01:37.069 --> 01:01:37.079 align:start position:0%
that was just basing it off the total
 
01:01:39.349 --> 01:01:39.359 align:start position:0%
you know going back to my sheet
 
01:01:43.309 --> 01:01:43.319 align:start position:0%
clicked in we also have to factor that
 
01:01:43.319 --> 01:01:44.870 align:start position:0%
clicked in we also have to factor that
the

01:01:44.870 --> 01:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:01:46.549 --> 01:01:46.559 align:start position:0%
I should give you a different run
 
01:01:48.349 --> 01:01:48.359 align:start position:0%
another number here while I'm sitting
 
01:01:50.750 --> 01:01:50.760 align:start position:0%
here that that takes into account that
 
01:01:52.849 --> 01:01:52.859 align:start position:0%
that would be funded through the other
 
01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
mechanism was considered earlier today
 
01:01:58.930 --> 01:01:58.940 align:start position:0%
which is the the different sources okay
 
01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
representative walner thank you this is
 
01:02:03.410 --> 01:02:03.420 align:start position:0%
sort of a question that takes me at
 
01:02:05.470 --> 01:02:05.480 align:start position:0%
least back to square one
 
01:02:08.630 --> 01:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
how much total
 
01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
general fund is spent
 
01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
on Medicaid providers the total of
 
01:02:16.130 --> 01:02:16.140 align:start position:0%
General funds
 
01:02:21.950 --> 01:02:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:26.390 --> 01:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:28.490 --> 01:02:28.500 align:start position:0%
my answer would come from a an email
 
01:02:30.589 --> 01:02:30.599 align:start position:0%
that Mr Littman provided I can try to
 
01:02:31.970 --> 01:02:31.980 align:start position:0%
find that and print that out for the
 
01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:33.190 align:start position:0%
find that and print that out for the
committee

01:02:33.190 --> 01:02:33.200 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:02:37.010 --> 01:02:37.020 align:start position:0%
I think he is using go just I think
 
01:02:39.530 --> 01:02:39.540 align:start position:0%
adjusting for the fact that granted
 
01:02:41.870 --> 01:02:41.880 align:start position:0%
Advantage funding for those Services
 
01:02:43.849 --> 01:02:43.859 align:start position:0%
would come through the other funding
 
01:02:46.370 --> 01:02:46.380 align:start position:0%
mechanism it's probably closer to 5
 
01:02:48.710 --> 01:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
million that would be the
 
01:02:51.170 --> 01:02:51.180 align:start position:0%
um the impact on this the 17 because
 
01:02:53.510 --> 01:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
none of that 17 was funding
 
01:02:56.930 --> 01:02:56.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:59.390 --> 01:02:59.400 align:start position:0%
so could I go back maybe Mr lichmann's
 
01:03:01.730 --> 01:03:01.740 align:start position:0%
got the figure
 
01:03:04.910 --> 01:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
how much General funds
 
01:03:07.970 --> 01:03:07.980 align:start position:0%
is used for Medicaid
 
01:03:10.670 --> 01:03:10.680 align:start position:0%
providers total
 
01:03:12.410 --> 01:03:12.420 align:start position:0%
all providers
 
01:03:16.130 --> 01:03:16.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:18.829 --> 01:03:18.839 align:start position:0%
sure so what we have included in the
 
01:03:21.410 --> 01:03:21.420 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended budget
 
01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
um in for standard Medicaid 7940a class
 
01:03:28.069 --> 01:03:28.079 align:start position:0%
101 is approximately 751 million in the
 
01:03:32.930 --> 01:03:32.940 align:start position:0%
first year and 760 million dollars total
 
01:03:36.589 --> 01:03:36.599 align:start position:0%
funds in the second year
 
01:03:40.730 --> 01:03:40.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:45.250 --> 01:03:45.260 align:start position:0%
um there is also the uh the chip program
 
01:04:12.109 --> 01:04:12.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:18.470 --> 01:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:23.510 --> 01:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
and that total is 113 roughly 113
 
01:04:26.170 --> 01:04:26.180 align:start position:0%
million and say fiscal year 24 and
 
01:04:29.390 --> 01:04:29.400 align:start position:0%
114.5 million in state fiscal year 25
 
01:04:32.089 --> 01:04:32.099 align:start position:0%
total funds
 
01:04:34.849 --> 01:04:34.859 align:start position:0%
now each of those standard Medicaid has
 
01:04:38.569 --> 01:04:38.579 align:start position:0%
50 50 chip is 65 35 so there's there's
 
01:04:40.730 --> 01:04:40.740 align:start position:0%
differentials on on the federal and
 
01:04:43.329 --> 01:04:43.339 align:start position:0%
general fund amounts
 
01:04:45.470 --> 01:04:45.480 align:start position:0%
and are the figures you're giving me
 
01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:47.569 align:start position:0%
and are the figures you're giving me
including

01:04:47.569 --> 01:04:47.579 align:start position:0%
including
 
01:04:51.650 --> 01:04:51.660 align:start position:0%
nursing homes home health aide all of
 
01:04:54.230 --> 01:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid all of the Medicaid
 
01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:55.609 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid all of the Medicaid
services

01:04:55.609 --> 01:04:55.619 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:04:58.309 --> 01:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
so that's that's a you know there's an
 
01:05:00.470 --> 01:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
additional number here and Kevin has a
 
01:05:03.230 --> 01:05:03.240 align:start position:0%
copy of what we had provided to him
 
01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:04.010 align:start position:0%
copy of what we had provided to him
um

01:05:04.010 --> 01:05:04.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:06.230 --> 01:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
in 22
 
01:05:07.970 --> 01:05:07.980 align:start position:0%
the state share
 
01:05:11.870 --> 01:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
was 658 million
 
01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:12.829 align:start position:0%
was 658 million
um

01:05:12.829 --> 01:05:12.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:12.839 --> 01:05:14.349 align:start position:0%
um
for

01:05:14.349 --> 01:05:14.359 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:05:17.349 --> 01:05:17.359 align:start position:0%
excluding granted advantage
 
01:05:20.930 --> 01:05:20.940 align:start position:0%
and the state share with granted
 
01:05:22.430 --> 01:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
advantage in 22
 
01:05:25.670 --> 01:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
excuse me the non-federal share in 22
 
01:05:28.309 --> 01:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
for granted Advantage was 36
 
01:05:31.309 --> 01:05:31.319 align:start position:0%
million and I think Kevin just went out
 
01:05:32.390 --> 01:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
to print
 
01:05:34.970 --> 01:05:34.980 align:start position:0%
that page for you great thank you but
 
01:05:37.849 --> 01:05:37.859 align:start position:0%
but representative Wallner just to
 
01:05:37.859 --> 01:05:39.049 align:start position:0%
but representative Wallner just to
clarify

01:05:39.049 --> 01:05:39.059 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
01:05:40.970 --> 01:05:40.980 align:start position:0%
um what's not included in those numbers
 
01:05:49.430 --> 01:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:52.870 --> 01:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
total General funds
 
01:05:56.569 --> 01:05:56.579 align:start position:0%
used as the match for all Medicaid
 
01:05:56.579 --> 01:05:57.829 align:start position:0%
used as the match for all Medicaid
services

01:05:57.829 --> 01:05:57.839 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:06:01.069 --> 01:06:01.079 align:start position:0%
and maybe um maybe I'm stating stating
 
01:06:03.650 --> 01:06:03.660 align:start position:0%
it incorrectly but that's I'm looking
 
01:06:07.250 --> 01:06:07.260 align:start position:0%
for what are we totally using of General
 
01:06:11.150 --> 01:06:11.160 align:start position:0%
funds to match all Medicaid services so
 
01:06:15.950 --> 01:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
the number I mentions the 658 includes
 
01:06:18.470 --> 01:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
all services not just what's in the
 
01:06:20.150 --> 01:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
division that provides the health
 
01:06:22.190 --> 01:06:22.200 align:start position:0%
insurance component includes the waivers
 
01:06:24.770 --> 01:06:24.780 align:start position:0%
and everything everything
 
01:07:08.710 --> 01:07:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:11.630 --> 01:07:11.640 align:start position:0%
if I could uh just um
 
01:07:14.510 --> 01:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
in we work with our actuary on those
 
01:07:16.490 --> 01:07:16.500 align:start position:0%
numbers and because of the time that the
 
01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:17.990 align:start position:0%
numbers and because of the time that the
governor's

01:07:17.990 --> 01:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
governor's
 
01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:18.829 align:start position:0%
governor's
um

01:07:18.829 --> 01:07:18.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:22.430 --> 01:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
talked about uh funding Services it does
 
01:07:25.430 --> 01:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
the number I just gave you looking at
 
01:07:27.910 --> 01:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
the footnote from the actuary excludes
 
01:07:31.250 --> 01:07:31.260 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy and and DME so that would be an
 
01:07:33.109 --> 01:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
additional piece I'd have to get to add
 
01:07:35.210 --> 01:07:35.220 align:start position:0%
to that that number
 
01:07:37.270 --> 01:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
say again the two things that excluded
 
01:07:39.710 --> 01:07:39.720 align:start position:0%
and if you could just get them pull the
 
01:07:45.730 --> 01:07:45.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:48.950 --> 01:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
so the
 
01:07:51.410 --> 01:07:51.420 align:start position:0%
um when we ran the numbers that I just
 
01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
quoted they excluded things that weren't
 
01:07:57.049 --> 01:07:57.059 align:start position:0%
Services durable medical equipment is a
 
01:08:01.490 --> 01:08:01.500 align:start position:0%
is a good if you will and Pharmacy is a
 
01:08:03.609 --> 01:08:03.619 align:start position:0%
is a good so we had not
 
01:08:07.130 --> 01:08:07.140 align:start position:0%
included those and and so the number
 
01:08:09.710 --> 01:08:09.720 align:start position:0%
that Kevin just passed out you'll see on
 
01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:10.849 align:start position:0%
that Kevin just passed out you'll see on
that

01:08:10.849 --> 01:08:10.859 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:08:13.069 --> 01:08:13.079 align:start position:0%
so unfortunately the printer is not
 
01:08:16.729 --> 01:08:16.739 align:start position:0%
working I did I did send this to em this
 
01:08:18.530 --> 01:08:18.540 align:start position:0%
email to everyone if they have access to
 
01:08:20.809 --> 01:08:20.819 align:start position:0%
email so otherwise it might be a might
 
01:08:22.370 --> 01:08:22.380 align:start position:0%
be a couple more a couple minutes before
 
01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
I can hand that out do you have an
 
01:08:26.030 --> 01:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
estimate representative stream since
 
01:08:27.709 --> 01:08:27.719 align:start position:0%
you've been playing with Pharmacy and
 
01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:29.699 align:start position:0%
durable goods you you think you know a
 
01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
ballpark for either of those the
 
01:08:35.630 --> 01:08:35.640 align:start position:0%
ballpark for DME is 23 million 230 38
 
01:08:39.169 --> 01:08:39.179 align:start position:0%
and 959 no just do round numbers you
 
01:08:43.010 --> 01:08:43.020 align:start position:0%
break my brain If you 23 million and 290
 
01:08:46.550 --> 01:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
million for pharmacy DME 23 million so
 
01:08:50.209 --> 01:08:50.219 align:start position:0%
an extra 323 million between those two
 
01:08:54.229 --> 01:08:54.239 align:start position:0%
items about plus 658 so we're tickling a
 
01:08:56.630 --> 01:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
billion I'm sorry those are full
 
01:08:58.610 --> 01:08:58.620 align:start position:0%
expenditures I could cut those in half
 
01:08:58.620 --> 01:09:00.590 align:start position:0%
expenditures I could cut those in half
okay

01:09:00.590 --> 01:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:09:03.410 --> 01:09:03.420 align:start position:0%
um so that's so we're like 8.75 General
 
01:09:06.050 --> 01:09:06.060 align:start position:0%
funds somewhere in that neighborhood I
 
01:09:07.309 --> 01:09:07.319 align:start position:0%
think that's what we're trying to answer
 
01:09:09.910 --> 01:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
your question with representative walner
 
01:09:13.189 --> 01:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
875 in that neighborhood
 
01:09:14.809 --> 01:09:14.819 align:start position:0%
it'd be nice to have all this in writing
 
01:09:17.269 --> 01:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
it it would it would and I don't think
 
01:09:19.130 --> 01:09:19.140 align:start position:0%
we're going to vote on this today I I
 
01:09:20.689 --> 01:09:20.699 align:start position:0%
get that but I would like to see it all
 
01:09:23.390 --> 01:09:23.400 align:start position:0%
in writing yeah yeah Kevin did send it
 
01:09:27.110 --> 01:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
an email I just got it an email
 
01:09:29.570 --> 01:09:29.580 align:start position:0%
so what was the real answer just the
 
01:09:32.570 --> 01:09:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:34.970 --> 01:09:34.980 align:start position:0%
well the answer I've been out in and out
 
01:09:36.530 --> 01:09:36.540 align:start position:0%
of the room but I think I heard Mr
 
01:09:38.030 --> 01:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
Lipman mentioned the two numbers that
 
01:09:39.650 --> 01:09:39.660 align:start position:0%
are shown here at the low end based on
 
01:09:43.010 --> 01:09:43.020 align:start position:0%
calendar year 19 uh the state share of
 
01:09:44.749 --> 01:09:44.759 align:start position:0%
Medicaid costs for providers was about
 
01:09:47.630 --> 01:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
556 million and at the high end based on
 
01:09:50.930 --> 01:09:50.940 align:start position:0%
fiscal 22 it was 658 million
 
01:09:54.770 --> 01:09:54.780 align:start position:0%
Plus Pharmacy Plus DME correct okay so
 
01:09:58.430 --> 01:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
so does your email add those
 
01:10:02.689 --> 01:10:02.699 align:start position:0%
it does not okay all right
 
01:10:02.699 --> 01:10:04.790 align:start position:0%
it does not okay all right
okay

01:10:04.790 --> 01:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:10:07.070 --> 01:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
so I assume that you wanted to know the
 
01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
875 number or whatever it is 850 880
 
01:10:12.530 --> 01:10:12.540 align:start position:0%
whatever that number is you're looking
 
01:10:12.540 --> 01:10:14.810 align:start position:0%
whatever that number is you're looking
to

01:10:14.810 --> 01:10:14.820 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:10:17.630 --> 01:10:17.640 align:start position:0%
um Baseline how much additional you
 
01:10:19.790 --> 01:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
think we ought to be doing is that the
 
01:10:21.649 --> 01:10:21.659 align:start position:0%
purpose of that number for you
 
01:10:23.930 --> 01:10:23.940 align:start position:0%
well I just hit heard you saying that
 
01:10:25.790 --> 01:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
you thought the bill that Senator
 
01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
Rosenwald brought brought in was around
 
01:10:31.189 --> 01:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
11 and I just wanted to see and I see
 
01:10:31.199 --> 01:10:32.090 align:start position:0%
11 and I just wanted to see and I see
that

01:10:32.090 --> 01:10:32.100 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:10:33.890 --> 01:10:33.900 align:start position:0%
um Kevin actually sent us some of that
 
01:10:40.729 --> 01:10:40.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:43.250 --> 01:10:43.260 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
01:10:46.189 --> 01:10:46.199 align:start position:0%
um I think we got going back to what
 
01:10:49.790 --> 01:10:49.800 align:start position:0%
items that we want to Target I think we
 
01:10:52.729 --> 01:10:52.739 align:start position:0%
may have agreement that the sheet that
 
01:10:55.070 --> 01:10:55.080 align:start position:0%
Mr Moynihan provided
 
01:10:58.070 --> 01:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
um is a good list of line items for us
 
01:11:02.209 --> 01:11:02.219 align:start position:0%
to consider and with the addition of two
 
01:11:04.149 --> 01:11:04.159 align:start position:0%
other line items I've heard
 
01:11:06.169 --> 01:11:06.179 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham say that
 
01:11:08.090 --> 01:11:08.100 align:start position:0%
there's nothing about Pharmacy and we
 
01:11:09.890 --> 01:11:09.900 align:start position:0%
ought to consider Pharmacy as well as
 
01:11:12.890 --> 01:11:12.900 align:start position:0%
the durable medical items that maybe
 
01:11:15.110 --> 01:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
some money needs to be allocated to that
 
01:11:18.410 --> 01:11:18.420 align:start position:0%
as well okay so so I'd kind of like to
 
01:11:21.709 --> 01:11:21.719 align:start position:0%
go through an exercise where we where we
 
01:11:24.590 --> 01:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
talk about these uh line items
 
01:11:28.370 --> 01:11:28.380 align:start position:0%
sort of in a kind of relative context to
 
01:11:29.570 --> 01:11:29.580 align:start position:0%
each other
 
01:11:32.450 --> 01:11:32.460 align:start position:0%
and I don't know I don't know how we're
 
01:11:34.070 --> 01:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
going to end up voting on this on Monday
 
01:11:36.350 --> 01:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
but but I do think there's a discussion
 
01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
that we can have on these items
 
01:11:41.930 --> 01:11:41.940 align:start position:0%
um the the
 
01:11:44.750 --> 01:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
I I'll I'll start by saying what I think
 
01:11:47.090 --> 01:11:47.100 align:start position:0%
the critical problem is that we must
 
01:11:49.669 --> 01:11:49.679 align:start position:0%
solve in this budget or at least try to
 
01:11:52.669 --> 01:11:52.679 align:start position:0%
mitigate to a very large extent and that
 
01:11:55.490 --> 01:11:55.500 align:start position:0%
is we have to give the hospitals an
 
01:11:59.090 --> 01:11:59.100 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have capacity that they
 
01:12:00.770 --> 01:12:00.780 align:start position:0%
can discharge into
 
01:12:04.370 --> 01:12:04.380 align:start position:0%
so of the items on here that I would
 
01:12:07.490 --> 01:12:07.500 align:start position:0%
prioritize my first priority would be
 
01:12:11.630 --> 01:12:11.640 align:start position:0%
any capacity beyond the hospital walls
 
01:12:15.490 --> 01:12:15.500 align:start position:0%
that would support their ability to
 
01:12:18.050 --> 01:12:18.060 align:start position:0%
discharge and and have that patient
 
01:12:20.950 --> 01:12:20.960 align:start position:0%
received properly so that would increase
 
01:12:23.870 --> 01:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
funding for things like the long-term
 
01:12:29.090 --> 01:12:29.100 align:start position:0%
care line the CFI home line
 
01:12:29.100 --> 01:12:37.669 align:start position:0%
care line the CFI home line
um

01:12:37.669 --> 01:12:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:39.590 --> 01:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
and those are those would be the two
 
01:12:42.709 --> 01:12:42.719 align:start position:0%
primary lines I see for creating
 
01:12:45.350 --> 01:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
capacity for discharge
 
01:12:48.530 --> 01:12:48.540 align:start position:0%
we could talk about input also to reduce
 
01:12:51.110 --> 01:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
the number of admissions but first I'd
 
01:12:52.669 --> 01:12:52.679 align:start position:0%
solve the discharge problem
 
01:12:55.310 --> 01:12:55.320 align:start position:0%
representative tolersky I just had a
 
01:12:56.930 --> 01:12:56.940 align:start position:0%
question and I appreciate going line by
 
01:12:58.669 --> 01:12:58.679 align:start position:0%
line but I think Ms Horgan might be able
 
01:13:01.490 --> 01:13:01.500 align:start position:0%
to help I'm a little concerned about the
 
01:13:03.649 --> 01:13:03.659 align:start position:0%
um to be announced next to home health
 
01:13:03.659 --> 01:13:05.510 align:start position:0%
um to be announced next to home health
aids

01:13:05.510 --> 01:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
aids
 
01:13:07.490 --> 01:13:07.500 align:start position:0%
um because I see that as a as a way to
 
01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:08.750 align:start position:0%
um because I see that as a as a way to
discharge

01:13:08.750 --> 01:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
discharge
 
01:13:11.390 --> 01:13:11.400 align:start position:0%
um people also is to have that
 
01:13:13.610 --> 01:13:13.620 align:start position:0%
that service and I don't know if there's
 
01:13:18.169 --> 01:13:18.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:18.179 --> 01:13:21.229 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:13:21.229 --> 01:13:21.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:22.970 --> 01:13:22.980 align:start position:0%
you have something you should be saying
 
01:13:24.470 --> 01:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
into a microphone
 
01:13:26.149 --> 01:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
do you have something we should repeat
 
01:13:27.590 --> 01:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
for you then
 
01:13:29.209 --> 01:13:29.219 align:start position:0%
what did what did you just said that
 
01:13:30.770 --> 01:13:30.780 align:start position:0%
they she does not have any information
 
01:13:33.350 --> 01:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
yet on home health aids and what that
 
01:13:36.649 --> 01:13:36.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:38.810 --> 01:13:38.820 align:start position:0%
oh so you're you're looking under the
 
01:13:41.630 --> 01:13:41.640 align:start position:0%
big category of state plan home health
 
01:13:44.030 --> 01:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
and then the Top Line home health aids
 
01:13:47.209 --> 01:13:47.219 align:start position:0%
under detailed requests TBA you want to
 
01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
know more detail I just I picture that
 
01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
as a way to discharge patients also to a
 
01:13:54.709 --> 01:13:54.719 align:start position:0%
home situation and to be able to have
 
01:13:56.450 --> 01:13:56.460 align:start position:0%
that kind of assistance at home so I was
 
01:13:59.330 --> 01:13:59.340 align:start position:0%
wondering what that number was in a
 
01:14:01.430 --> 01:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
general Factor since it's a zero right
 
01:14:03.169 --> 01:14:03.179 align:start position:0%
now I think I agree with you and that's
 
01:14:04.850 --> 01:14:04.860 align:start position:0%
an excellent question
 
01:14:08.209 --> 01:14:08.219 align:start position:0%
thank you so without without input from
 
01:14:13.010 --> 01:14:13.020 align:start position:0%
from a provider I would suggest if we
 
01:14:15.110 --> 01:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
end up digging into the line that we use
 
01:14:18.050 --> 01:14:18.060 align:start position:0%
what the existing budget is uh case
 
01:14:21.350 --> 01:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
management loads and see what
 
01:14:24.890 --> 01:14:24.900 align:start position:0%
um you know 12 increase would would
 
01:14:28.550 --> 01:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
bring it to if it's or maybe 15 since
 
01:14:31.370 --> 01:14:31.380 align:start position:0%
it's similar to nursing homes so I just
 
01:14:33.649 --> 01:14:33.659 align:start position:0%
want to remind us of where we are in the
 
01:14:37.189 --> 01:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
space-time Continuum we we have to vote
 
01:14:41.689 --> 01:14:41.699 align:start position:0%
on a a documented amendment to hb1 and
 
01:14:45.290 --> 01:14:45.300 align:start position:0%
hb2 those votes ought to be done what no
 
01:14:48.110 --> 01:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
later than Tuesday Mr Ripple
 
01:14:51.530 --> 01:14:51.540 align:start position:0%
Tuesday yes so so anytime we say we have
 
01:14:53.390 --> 01:14:53.400 align:start position:0%
some homework or we have another person
 
01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
we need to bring in or anything like
 
01:14:58.430 --> 01:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
that it we start to run into the the
 
01:15:01.970 --> 01:15:01.980 align:start position:0%
wall of impracticality that that so so
 
01:15:05.450 --> 01:15:05.460 align:start position:0%
so so so let's let's say representative
 
01:15:08.450 --> 01:15:08.460 align:start position:0%
100 right and it would be wise to
 
01:15:10.910 --> 01:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
support the home health aids number
 
01:15:13.669 --> 01:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
in the in the in the lack of in the
 
01:15:16.850 --> 01:15:16.860 align:start position:0%
absence of some kind of of better
 
01:15:16.860 --> 01:15:18.430 align:start position:0%
absence of some kind of of better
information

01:15:18.430 --> 01:15:18.440 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:15:21.649 --> 01:15:21.659 align:start position:0%
I've gotten really comfortable in a
 
01:15:25.370 --> 01:15:25.380 align:start position:0%
budgeting cycle of using Wags our best
 
01:15:28.729 --> 01:15:28.739 align:start position:0%
wild ass to to get into the ballpark
 
01:15:31.490 --> 01:15:31.500 align:start position:0%
right and as long as we're using some
 
01:15:34.850 --> 01:15:34.860 align:start position:0%
judgment and and all we we would do
 
01:15:38.270 --> 01:15:38.280 align:start position:0%
better than just doing nothing so zero
 
01:15:40.910 --> 01:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
percent of a TBA is too low so we ought
 
01:15:42.410 --> 01:15:42.420 align:start position:0%
to do I just want to make sure that we
 
01:15:44.030 --> 01:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
don't it doesn't get lost in the shuffle
 
01:15:46.430 --> 01:15:46.440 align:start position:0%
and I wanted to clarify that we had no
 
01:15:47.930 --> 01:15:47.940 align:start position:0%
more information at this point so that
 
01:15:51.350 --> 01:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
we can take a somewhat I that's your
 
01:15:53.750 --> 01:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
term sir yeah yeah go ahead represent
 
01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:54.950 align:start position:0%
term sir yeah yeah go ahead represent
Weiler

01:15:54.950 --> 01:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
Weiler
 
01:16:01.669 --> 01:16:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:03.950 --> 01:16:03.960 align:start position:0%
I I would have to go back to the numbers
 
01:16:05.570 --> 01:16:05.580 align:start position:0%
to determine that amount but I can get
 
01:16:08.270 --> 01:16:08.280 align:start position:0%
that for you but but I think to the
 
01:16:10.910 --> 01:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
broader Point these are distinct we have
 
01:16:13.430 --> 01:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
CFI and then we have a different issue
 
01:16:15.950 --> 01:16:15.960 align:start position:0%
related to the stone estate plan Home
 
01:16:18.470 --> 01:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
Health with home health aids they are
 
01:16:21.229 --> 01:16:21.239 align:start position:0%
not the same yes right
 
01:16:23.090 --> 01:16:23.100 align:start position:0%
right but we just don't know the dollar
 
01:16:23.100 --> 01:16:24.110 align:start position:0%
right but we just don't know the dollar
amount

01:16:24.110 --> 01:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
amount
 
01:16:26.390 --> 01:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
yeah I I think we would need to go back
 
01:16:27.770 --> 01:16:27.780 align:start position:0%
and look at the details because because
 
01:16:29.810 --> 01:16:29.820 align:start position:0%
we're really talking about a lot of very
 
01:16:32.570 --> 01:16:32.580 align:start position:0%
detailed things here and in Broad ways
 
01:16:34.729 --> 01:16:34.739 align:start position:0%
and I I think if we can maybe just kind
 
01:16:35.930 --> 01:16:35.940 align:start position:0%
of step back and get some detail
 
01:16:37.550 --> 01:16:37.560 align:start position:0%
together that may be best for the
 
01:16:38.930 --> 01:16:38.940 align:start position:0%
committee just to have informed
 
01:16:38.940 --> 01:16:47.750 align:start position:0%
committee just to have informed
discussions

01:16:47.750 --> 01:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:51.530 --> 01:16:51.540 align:start position:0%
oh okay so so that's my first proposal
 
01:16:54.729 --> 01:16:54.739 align:start position:0%
just in as a principle is that we fund
 
01:16:57.770 --> 01:16:57.780 align:start position:0%
discharge capacity
 
01:17:01.070 --> 01:17:01.080 align:start position:0%
so then the other end of that systems
 
01:17:04.209 --> 01:17:04.219 align:start position:0%
view is what can we do to reduce
 
01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
the inputs the patients flowing into the
 
01:17:10.970 --> 01:17:10.980 align:start position:0%
hospitals that would be kind of my
 
01:17:15.110 --> 01:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
secondary investment priority to try to
 
01:17:18.350 --> 01:17:18.360 align:start position:0%
do the things we can in the community to
 
01:17:22.490 --> 01:17:22.500 align:start position:0%
preclude or to to mitigate the number of
 
01:17:25.729 --> 01:17:25.739 align:start position:0%
admissions that are taking place
 
01:17:30.050 --> 01:17:30.060 align:start position:0%
so and so in that line
 
01:17:33.350 --> 01:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
uh things like the community health
 
01:17:40.070 --> 01:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:42.709 --> 01:17:42.719 align:start position:0%
outpatient services might have already
 
01:17:46.550 --> 01:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
been needed but but so so those
 
01:17:50.750 --> 01:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
Community Health Center Services would
 
01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
get a priority for me for trying to
 
01:17:56.510 --> 01:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
reduce the amount of inpatients that go
 
01:17:58.910 --> 01:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
to the hospital to begin with is there
 
01:18:04.090 --> 01:18:04.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:06.830 --> 01:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
I saw a thumbs up representative norgren
 
01:18:08.990 --> 01:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
you like the principles so far we got
 
01:18:12.229 --> 01:18:12.239 align:start position:0%
priority one priority two representative
 
01:18:12.239 --> 01:18:15.229 align:start position:0%
priority one priority two representative
walner

01:18:15.229 --> 01:18:15.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:17.030 --> 01:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
well I think there are other things that
 
01:18:18.770 --> 01:18:18.780 align:start position:0%
I mean
 
01:18:21.290 --> 01:18:21.300 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder I mean
 
01:18:23.930 --> 01:18:23.940 align:start position:0%
opioid treatment programs I mean if we
 
01:18:27.229 --> 01:18:27.239 align:start position:0%
treat people before they end up with
 
01:18:30.169 --> 01:18:30.179 align:start position:0%
serious health issues
 
01:18:31.790 --> 01:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
going to keep them out of the hospitals
 
01:18:35.090 --> 01:18:35.100 align:start position:0%
and if that's your I mean to me
 
01:18:37.669 --> 01:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
yes keeping people out of the hospitals
 
01:18:37.679 --> 01:18:40.370 align:start position:0%
yes keeping people out of the hospitals
is

01:18:40.370 --> 01:18:40.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:43.669 --> 01:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
an excellent goal but a lot of these
 
01:18:46.130 --> 01:18:46.140 align:start position:0%
other services keep people from going
 
01:18:49.430 --> 01:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
into higher higher levels of care I mean
 
01:18:53.390 --> 01:18:53.400 align:start position:0%
for instance the DD population
 
01:18:55.430 --> 01:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
if these Services aren't available for
 
01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:56.810 align:start position:0%
if these Services aren't available for
them

01:18:56.810 --> 01:18:56.820 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:18:59.030 --> 01:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
they end up needing institutionalization
 
01:19:03.110 --> 01:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:05.689 --> 01:19:05.699 align:start position:0%
so much more than if we were providing
 
01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
the services to them in their homes
 
01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:09.649 align:start position:0%
the services to them in their homes
um

01:19:09.649 --> 01:19:09.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:13.010 --> 01:19:13.020 align:start position:0%
say same with the mental health centers
 
01:19:14.990 --> 01:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
if we don't do this work in the
 
01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.010 align:start position:0%
if we don't do this work in the
community

01:19:16.010 --> 01:19:16.020 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:19:17.930 --> 01:19:17.940 align:start position:0%
we're going to end up
 
01:19:17.940 --> 01:19:19.310 align:start position:0%
we're going to end up
with

01:19:19.310 --> 01:19:19.320 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:19:22.630 --> 01:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hop and needing more
 
01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:24.350 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hop and needing more
inpatient

01:19:24.350 --> 01:19:24.360 align:start position:0%
inpatient
 
01:19:26.470 --> 01:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital type Services
 
01:19:30.709 --> 01:19:30.719 align:start position:0%
Hampstead Hospital I mean all of these
 
01:19:34.010 --> 01:19:34.020 align:start position:0%
all of these lead a lot of these prevent
 
01:19:35.870 --> 01:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
us from having to have higher end
 
01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:38.030 align:start position:0%
us from having to have higher end
services

01:19:38.030 --> 01:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:39.350 align:start position:0%
services
I

01:19:39.350 --> 01:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:19:41.750 --> 01:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
I don't really disagree with what you
 
01:19:44.750 --> 01:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
what you just said I I
 
01:19:47.930 --> 01:19:47.940 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to take a look at this from a
 
01:19:47.940 --> 01:19:50.350 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to take a look at this from a
narrower

01:19:50.350 --> 01:19:50.360 align:start position:0%
narrower
 
01:19:52.550 --> 01:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
prioritize basis
 
01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:53.870 align:start position:0%
prioritize basis
and

01:19:53.870 --> 01:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:19:58.570 --> 01:19:58.580 align:start position:0%
um I I and maybe I don't know the Ed
 
01:20:01.250 --> 01:20:01.260 align:start position:0%
warehousing problem boarding I guess is
 
01:20:04.330 --> 01:20:04.340 align:start position:0%
the word Edie boarding issue well enough
 
01:20:08.630 --> 01:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
but I don't imagine that
 
01:20:12.169 --> 01:20:12.179 align:start position:0%
the patients that are being subjected to
 
01:20:13.910 --> 01:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
Ed boarding
 
01:20:16.729 --> 01:20:16.739 align:start position:0%
have a high correlation with the DD
 
01:20:16.739 --> 01:20:18.590 align:start position:0%
have a high correlation with the DD
community

01:20:18.590 --> 01:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:20:22.070 --> 01:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
so so I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm just telling
 
01:20:23.570 --> 01:20:23.580 align:start position:0%
you my assumption I don't know if that's
 
01:20:25.669 --> 01:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
right or not that's my assumption that
 
01:20:28.970 --> 01:20:28.980 align:start position:0%
the DD Community is not being brought in
 
01:20:30.649 --> 01:20:30.659 align:start position:0%
to the Ed
 
01:20:32.689 --> 01:20:32.699 align:start position:0%
boarding problem
 
01:20:34.910 --> 01:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
and my first goal
 
01:20:38.930 --> 01:20:38.940 align:start position:0%
is to Let's solve the Ed boarding
 
01:20:41.390 --> 01:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
problem as our first priority with the
 
01:20:42.590 --> 01:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
extra money
 
01:20:44.450 --> 01:20:44.460 align:start position:0%
not that there aren't other priorities
 
01:20:47.149 --> 01:20:47.159 align:start position:0%
not that there aren't other goals but if
 
01:20:48.950 --> 01:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to
 
01:20:52.910 --> 01:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
take limited resources we ought to try
 
01:20:56.149 --> 01:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
to focus it to have the most significant
 
01:20:58.610 --> 01:20:58.620 align:start position:0%
impact on the biggest problem that we
 
01:21:03.169 --> 01:21:03.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:06.470 --> 01:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
I was just going to comment that I think
 
01:21:08.390 --> 01:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
there was a connection made there that
 
01:21:10.930 --> 01:21:10.940 align:start position:0%
wasn't exactly a direct line
 
01:21:14.270 --> 01:21:14.280 align:start position:0%
and I believe representative walner was
 
01:21:18.229 --> 01:21:18.239 align:start position:0%
simply pointing out that funding a
 
01:21:18.239 --> 01:21:19.550 align:start position:0%
simply pointing out that funding a
certain

01:21:19.550 --> 01:21:19.560 align:start position:0%
certain
 
01:21:23.330 --> 01:21:23.340 align:start position:0%
group align items here that that
 
01:21:26.149 --> 01:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
helps the hospital flow for the
 
01:21:28.130 --> 01:21:28.140 align:start position:0%
Emergency Department boarding crisis
 
01:21:29.830 --> 01:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
which you pointed to
 
01:21:32.510 --> 01:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
that actually is not
 
01:21:35.149 --> 01:21:35.159 align:start position:0%
Direct that's not connected at all with
 
01:21:37.030 --> 01:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
the developmental disability community
 
01:21:39.470 --> 01:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
and representative wallner's point was
 
01:21:43.010 --> 01:21:43.020 align:start position:0%
simply that if we don't
 
01:21:43.020 --> 01:21:43.790 align:start position:0%
simply that if we don't
um

01:21:43.790 --> 01:21:43.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:45.189 align:start position:0%
um
fund

01:21:45.189 --> 01:21:45.199 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:21:47.810 --> 01:21:47.820 align:start position:0%
these AIDS and services and all the
 
01:21:49.070 --> 01:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
people that showed up at the budget
 
01:21:49.080 --> 01:21:50.810 align:start position:0%
people that showed up at the budget
hearing

01:21:50.810 --> 01:21:50.820 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:21:52.669 --> 01:21:52.679 align:start position:0%
um particularly the family with the two
 
01:21:54.830 --> 01:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
grown sons in their 20s and the mother
 
01:21:57.470 --> 01:21:57.480 align:start position:0%
who is their sole caregiver and needs
 
01:21:59.209 --> 01:21:59.219 align:start position:0%
surgery but can't get surgery because
 
01:22:01.870 --> 01:22:01.880 align:start position:0%
she has no caregivers if we don't fund
 
01:22:04.910 --> 01:22:04.920 align:start position:0%
that Community the alternative is we're
 
01:22:08.570 --> 01:22:08.580 align:start position:0%
going to have to pay for these men to go
 
01:22:10.970 --> 01:22:10.980 align:start position:0%
live in a nursing home which is going to
 
01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
cost the state so much more so there's
 
01:22:15.169 --> 01:22:15.179 align:start position:0%
no connection to the emergency
 
01:22:18.410 --> 01:22:18.420 align:start position:0%
department boarding so much as
 
01:22:20.930 --> 01:22:20.940 align:start position:0%
the costs that we will bear
 
01:22:25.070 --> 01:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
by pushing this group which is so high I
 
01:22:28.610 --> 01:22:28.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:30.590 --> 01:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
forgive me that I don't have it in front
 
01:22:33.649 --> 01:22:33.659 align:start position:0%
of me 35 million for the DD and brain
 
01:22:36.229 --> 01:22:36.239 align:start position:0%
injury Community if we don't deal with
 
01:22:39.169 --> 01:22:39.179 align:start position:0%
that then we are going to be paying a
 
01:22:41.090 --> 01:22:41.100 align:start position:0%
much bigger price tag
 
01:22:42.890 --> 01:22:42.900 align:start position:0%
for these people that have to get moved
 
01:22:45.550 --> 01:22:45.560 align:start position:0%
to a nursing home or an institution
 
01:22:47.750 --> 01:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
would you believe I agree with
 
01:22:49.370 --> 01:22:49.380 align:start position:0%
everything you just said and everything
 
01:22:51.350 --> 01:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
that representative Wallner said
 
01:22:53.510 --> 01:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
but I'm not sure that you I've
 
01:22:55.910 --> 01:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
communicated the process I'm trying to
 
01:22:59.510 --> 01:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
to follow I'm trying to solve one
 
01:23:02.810 --> 01:23:02.820 align:start position:0%
strategic problem well and then when we
 
01:23:04.669 --> 01:23:04.679 align:start position:0%
think we know how to address that
 
01:23:07.070 --> 01:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
strategic problem we can go to a second
 
01:23:08.750 --> 01:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
strategic problem
 
01:23:11.090 --> 01:23:11.100 align:start position:0%
and and do this in some sort of a
 
01:23:13.250 --> 01:23:13.260 align:start position:0%
prioritized basis because we have
 
01:23:16.610 --> 01:23:16.620 align:start position:0%
limited resources and unlimited once and
 
01:23:16.620 --> 01:23:17.689 align:start position:0%
limited resources and unlimited once and
so

01:23:17.689 --> 01:23:17.699 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:23:20.510 --> 01:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that approach yeah
 
01:23:24.950 --> 01:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
I guess I don't agree that it's a black
 
01:23:28.310 --> 01:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
and white draw line situation
 
01:23:30.169 --> 01:23:30.179 align:start position:0%
by the time we walk through all of the
 
01:23:30.179 --> 01:23:31.310 align:start position:0%
by the time we walk through all of the
goals

01:23:31.310 --> 01:23:31.320 align:start position:0%
goals
 
01:23:33.770 --> 01:23:33.780 align:start position:0%
it's no longer black and white it's a
 
01:23:35.870 --> 01:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
beautiful Mosaic of a comprehensive
 
01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:36.890 align:start position:0%
beautiful Mosaic of a comprehensive
puzzle

01:23:36.890 --> 01:23:36.900 align:start position:0%
puzzle
 
01:23:40.189 --> 01:23:40.199 align:start position:0%
but you gotta like in my experience
 
01:23:43.250 --> 01:23:43.260 align:start position:0%
having done this for 40 years you you
 
01:23:46.250 --> 01:23:46.260 align:start position:0%
need you need to focus on particular
 
01:23:49.010 --> 01:23:49.020 align:start position:0%
issues solve them before you go on to
 
01:23:50.870 --> 01:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
the next one and you do that in a
 
01:23:53.630 --> 01:23:53.640 align:start position:0%
prioritized basis so
 
01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:55.270 align:start position:0%
prioritized basis so
um

01:23:55.270 --> 01:23:55.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:57.890 --> 01:23:57.900 align:start position:0%
it's because if we don't have if we
 
01:23:59.510 --> 01:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
don't have some sort of guide the
 
01:24:01.490 --> 01:24:01.500 align:start position:0%
guidelines or guide rails on our
 
01:24:03.169 --> 01:24:03.179 align:start position:0%
conversations we'll just end up going
 
01:24:06.050 --> 01:24:06.060 align:start position:0%
all over the place every single time you
 
01:24:07.810 --> 01:24:07.820 align:start position:0%
know it will you know
 
01:24:10.189 --> 01:24:10.199 align:start position:0%
which maybe we should just do that I
 
01:24:11.810 --> 01:24:11.820 align:start position:0%
think the Senate's approach was let's
 
01:24:13.910 --> 01:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
just give the department the money and
 
01:24:16.910 --> 01:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
let them figure it out I'm I'm trying to
 
01:24:18.310 --> 01:24:18.320 align:start position:0%
have us
 
01:24:21.229 --> 01:24:21.239 align:start position:0%
be a little bit more judicious and give
 
01:24:22.850 --> 01:24:22.860 align:start position:0%
a little bit more guidance to the
 
01:24:24.709 --> 01:24:24.719 align:start position:0%
department to say here are the
 
01:24:27.169 --> 01:24:27.179 align:start position:0%
legislative priorities but if we can't
 
01:24:28.970 --> 01:24:28.980 align:start position:0%
have that discussion then we'll have to
 
01:24:30.770 --> 01:24:30.780 align:start position:0%
do what the Senate is going to do and
 
01:24:32.810 --> 01:24:32.820 align:start position:0%
this is here's the money go spend it the
 
01:24:34.550 --> 01:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
way you want representative I totally
 
01:24:36.770 --> 01:24:36.780 align:start position:0%
agree that I appreciate this
 
01:24:38.810 --> 01:24:38.820 align:start position:0%
conversation and the way we're going I
 
01:24:40.610 --> 01:24:40.620 align:start position:0%
think this is the right way to go I was
 
01:24:42.590 --> 01:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
just simply questioning a connection
 
01:24:45.229 --> 01:24:45.239 align:start position:0%
yeah that was made and I want just want
 
01:24:46.729 --> 01:24:46.739 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we are not forgetting
 
01:24:49.970 --> 01:24:49.980 align:start position:0%
the biggest piece of this puzzle here in
 
01:24:51.950 --> 01:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
terms of of funds that's it we can move
 
01:24:56.090 --> 01:24:56.100 align:start position:0%
on it's okay so so we'll we'll actually
 
01:24:59.750 --> 01:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
jump I think now maybe not because it's
 
01:25:01.850 --> 01:25:01.860 align:start position:0%
the right order but it's become the
 
01:25:05.530 --> 01:25:05.540 align:start position:0%
right order I I think we had a different
 
01:25:09.850 --> 01:25:09.860 align:start position:0%
approach on the DD community
 
01:25:14.390 --> 01:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
that we found Let's see we found that in
 
01:25:16.130 --> 01:25:16.140 align:start position:0%
the DD community
 
01:25:20.149 --> 01:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
there is currently a huge lapse that we
 
01:25:23.270 --> 01:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
can discuss a carry forward on and so
 
01:25:25.490 --> 01:25:25.500 align:start position:0%
this line item on the DD and brain
 
01:25:29.450 --> 01:25:29.460 align:start position:0%
injury is its own strategic problem but
 
01:25:31.790 --> 01:25:31.800 align:start position:0%
it may also have its own
 
01:25:34.970 --> 01:25:34.980 align:start position:0%
potential resources available to solving
 
01:25:38.450 --> 01:25:38.460 align:start position:0%
it that that deity and brain injury line
 
01:25:41.270 --> 01:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
and and Mr Ripple and Mr lippman is gone
 
01:25:44.330 --> 01:25:44.340 align:start position:0%
so Mr White I'll turn to you but it's my
 
01:25:46.310 --> 01:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
understanding that of that for that 35
 
01:25:49.610 --> 01:25:49.620 align:start position:0%
35 there's a current
 
01:25:53.330 --> 01:25:53.340 align:start position:0%
amount of about 60 million or is it 80
 
01:25:55.729 --> 01:25:55.739 align:start position:0%
million I'll I'll let you correct me but
 
01:25:58.310 --> 01:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
there's a fairly large amount of money
 
01:26:01.370 --> 01:26:01.380 align:start position:0%
that's set to lapse that we could roll
 
01:26:04.970 --> 01:26:04.980 align:start position:0%
forward to pay at least pay down that
 
01:26:08.950 --> 01:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
35. sure so the acquired brain disorder
 
01:26:13.669 --> 01:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
account the DD Services account and then
 
01:26:17.030 --> 01:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
the children's IHS account those are all
 
01:26:18.890 --> 01:26:18.900 align:start position:0%
continually appropriate and non-lapsing
 
01:26:24.530 --> 01:26:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:26.890 --> 01:26:26.900 align:start position:0%
um and so there's a provision section
 
01:26:30.010 --> 01:26:30.020 align:start position:0%
232 in hb2 that would allow us
 
01:26:32.530 --> 01:26:32.540 align:start position:0%
explicitly to carry those funds forward
 
01:26:35.750 --> 01:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
we had based our our budget on the
 
01:26:37.250 --> 01:26:37.260 align:start position:0%
assumption that those funds would be
 
01:26:38.870 --> 01:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
carried forward in accordance with the
 
01:26:42.169 --> 01:26:42.179 align:start position:0%
law to be used for services provided in
 
01:26:47.229 --> 01:26:47.239 align:start position:0%
in 24 for existing for existing clients
 
01:26:50.450 --> 01:26:50.460 align:start position:0%
so I I guess just to bring us back to
 
01:26:53.030 --> 01:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
this document and maybe this is a Ms
 
01:26:57.350 --> 01:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
Horgan head shake uh question uh does
 
01:27:00.890 --> 01:27:00.900 align:start position:0%
this does this incremental 35 million in
 
01:27:04.490 --> 01:27:04.500 align:start position:0%
a year for the DD and brain injury line
 
01:27:07.430 --> 01:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
did that anticipate that there was
 
01:27:09.830 --> 01:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
already money that was going to non-laps
 
01:27:11.750 --> 01:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
and carry forward into the next fiscal
 
01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:13.070 align:start position:0%
and carry forward into the next fiscal
year

01:27:13.070 --> 01:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:27:14.209 --> 01:27:14.219 align:start position:0%
got it
 
01:27:17.510 --> 01:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:20.169 --> 01:27:20.179 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:27:21.950 --> 01:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
Edwards just
 
01:27:25.070 --> 01:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
um just to muddy this up a little bit
 
01:27:28.430 --> 01:27:28.440 align:start position:0%
but I think it's important is what we're
 
01:27:30.410 --> 01:27:30.420 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
01:27:32.870 --> 01:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
um is not just the budget but what were
 
01:27:34.850 --> 01:27:34.860 align:start position:0%
the rate increases be if somebody's
 
01:27:38.330 --> 01:27:38.340 align:start position:0%
getting paid 14 an hour and it's built
 
01:27:41.870 --> 01:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
in to the Medicaid fee schedule
 
01:27:43.910 --> 01:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
um if you increase that amount by three
 
01:27:46.910 --> 01:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
percent it's a relatively small amount
 
01:27:49.370 --> 01:27:49.380 align:start position:0%
for a home health aide or whatever rate
 
01:27:51.470 --> 01:27:51.480 align:start position:0%
that represents
 
01:27:54.410 --> 01:27:54.420 align:start position:0%
um you know uh so you know somebody
 
01:27:56.870 --> 01:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
still has to do the work to get to get
 
01:28:00.110 --> 01:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
these uh these monies and I think you
 
01:28:02.030 --> 01:28:02.040 align:start position:0%
know you made a very
 
01:28:04.490 --> 01:28:04.500 align:start position:0%
um uh an important observation in the
 
01:28:06.709 --> 01:28:06.719 align:start position:0%
beginning uh when we started this
 
01:28:10.070 --> 01:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
process that uh if we increase the rates
 
01:28:12.530 --> 01:28:12.540 align:start position:0%
enough you know maybe the vacancies will
 
01:28:14.990 --> 01:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
go down the amount of services we
 
01:28:17.450 --> 01:28:17.460 align:start position:0%
provide might go up a bit because
 
01:28:20.090 --> 01:28:20.100 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of untapped need the way
 
01:28:25.570 --> 01:28:25.580 align:start position:0%
we control the budget is um by as uh
 
01:28:28.129 --> 01:28:28.139 align:start position:0%
unfortunately is by having such low
 
01:28:30.530 --> 01:28:30.540 align:start position:0%
rates that uh the people that are
 
01:28:32.629 --> 01:28:32.639 align:start position:0%
eligible for the service often don't get
 
01:28:35.990 --> 01:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
it so we spend less so
 
01:28:39.470 --> 01:28:39.480 align:start position:0%
um really really what this 18 I think
 
01:28:41.629 --> 01:28:41.639 align:start position:0%
that the disability Community is asking
 
01:28:44.410 --> 01:28:44.420 align:start position:0%
for is a change in the rates
 
01:28:48.530 --> 01:28:48.540 align:start position:0%
for the services that they provide and
 
01:28:51.050 --> 01:28:51.060 align:start position:0%
it's not divided out there's probably 40
 
01:28:53.750 --> 01:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
different uh service codes that they
 
01:28:56.050 --> 01:28:56.060 align:start position:0%
have they just they just gave us one
 
01:28:58.370 --> 01:28:58.380 align:start position:0%
across the entire
 
01:29:02.810 --> 01:29:02.820 align:start position:0%
um uh benefit benefit category so
 
01:29:02.820 --> 01:29:04.729 align:start position:0%
um uh benefit benefit category so
um

01:29:04.729 --> 01:29:04.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:06.709 --> 01:29:06.719 align:start position:0%
you know everything else that we're
 
01:29:08.149 --> 01:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
going to have to assume is that it
 
01:29:11.990 --> 01:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't impact utilization and we we may
 
01:29:14.209 --> 01:29:14.219 align:start position:0%
may want to think about I mean obviously
 
01:29:16.850 --> 01:29:16.860 align:start position:0%
the goal of boosting
 
01:29:19.490 --> 01:29:19.500 align:start position:0%
um long-term care for example is to
 
01:29:21.410 --> 01:29:21.420 align:start position:0%
increase utilization so more of those
 
01:29:24.530 --> 01:29:24.540 align:start position:0%
people get out of the hospital so
 
01:29:24.540 --> 01:29:26.270 align:start position:0%
people get out of the hospital so
um

01:29:26.270 --> 01:29:26.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:29.750 --> 01:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh I think we just kind of need to keep
 
01:29:34.250 --> 01:29:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:36.169 --> 01:29:36.179 align:start position:0%
you're you're playing chess I'm playing
 
01:29:39.050 --> 01:29:39.060 align:start position:0%
checkers my checker game right now is
 
01:29:43.010 --> 01:29:43.020 align:start position:0%
just simply uh deferring how much new
 
01:29:45.410 --> 01:29:45.420 align:start position:0%
money we're going to put into this and
 
01:29:48.970 --> 01:29:48.980 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out what
 
01:29:48.980 --> 01:29:50.750 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out what
categories

01:29:50.750 --> 01:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
categories
 
01:29:53.629 --> 01:29:53.639 align:start position:0%
are relatively important and prioritized
 
01:29:55.850 --> 01:29:55.860 align:start position:0%
and how we might solve them okay you're
 
01:29:58.610 --> 01:29:58.620 align:start position:0%
sort of at the next level which once we
 
01:29:59.990 --> 01:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
decide that
 
01:30:02.629 --> 01:30:02.639 align:start position:0%
how do we implement it how do we turn
 
01:30:04.729 --> 01:30:04.739 align:start position:0%
that in and that's where Mr Ripple comes
 
01:30:07.729 --> 01:30:07.739 align:start position:0%
in with Mr lippman and Mr White how do
 
01:30:10.370 --> 01:30:10.380 align:start position:0%
we turn that extra money into something
 
01:30:13.070 --> 01:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
actionable whether it's increased pay
 
01:30:14.990 --> 01:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
raises or I don't know
 
01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:16.189 align:start position:0%
raises or I don't know
I

01:30:16.189 --> 01:30:16.199 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:30:18.950 --> 01:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
I I'm I'm I'm operating in a more
 
01:30:23.810 --> 01:30:23.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:23.820 --> 01:30:27.110 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:30:27.110 --> 01:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:31.430 --> 01:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
okay so I I think
 
01:30:33.890 --> 01:30:33.900 align:start position:0%
I'm still trying to figure out because I
 
01:30:36.470 --> 01:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
thought in our
 
01:30:40.370 --> 01:30:40.380 align:start position:0%
caucus that we understood uh this deity
 
01:30:44.090 --> 01:30:44.100 align:start position:0%
and brain injury line item that they're
 
01:30:47.270 --> 01:30:47.280 align:start position:0%
asking for 35 million per year
 
01:30:50.330 --> 01:30:50.340 align:start position:0%
and that incremental amount that
 
01:30:53.750 --> 01:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
explains why but irrespective the answer
 
01:30:55.910 --> 01:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
is 35 million
 
01:31:00.050 --> 01:31:00.060 align:start position:0%
um that that could be supported by the
 
01:31:03.350 --> 01:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
current amount that could be carried
 
01:31:05.750 --> 01:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
over without the lapse you thank you for
 
01:31:07.490 --> 01:31:07.500 align:start position:0%
the correction on the language it's not
 
01:31:11.570 --> 01:31:11.580 align:start position:0%
going to lapse but it's still a surplus
 
01:31:15.709 --> 01:31:15.719 align:start position:0%
that can carry over into the next year
 
01:31:19.310 --> 01:31:19.320 align:start position:0%
yes our our our initial agency budget
 
01:31:21.229 --> 01:31:21.239 align:start position:0%
and the conversations that we had during
 
01:31:24.229 --> 01:31:24.239 align:start position:0%
the governor's phase of the budget we we
 
01:31:27.649 --> 01:31:27.659 align:start position:0%
based our figures at that time our in
 
01:31:30.110 --> 01:31:30.120 align:start position:0%
class 7100 are spend figures on the
 
01:31:31.550 --> 01:31:31.560 align:start position:0%
assumption that we would have those
 
01:31:34.070 --> 01:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
carry forward funds available
 
01:31:36.770 --> 01:31:36.780 align:start position:0%
at that time
 
01:31:39.770 --> 01:31:39.780 align:start position:0%
so so this is yet still another 35
 
01:31:43.610 --> 01:31:43.620 align:start position:0%
million without regard to the amount of
 
01:31:45.830 --> 01:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
surplus it's in the current year
 
01:31:48.050 --> 01:31:48.060 align:start position:0%
it's it's a it's a function of the fact
 
01:31:49.970 --> 01:31:49.980 align:start position:0%
that that that these counts are
 
01:31:51.950 --> 01:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
continually appropriated and non-lapsing
 
01:31:53.990 --> 01:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
all right I I I know but you I don't
 
01:31:55.490 --> 01:31:55.500 align:start position:0%
know if you even looking at what we're
 
01:31:58.750 --> 01:31:58.760 align:start position:0%
looking at we're looking at Mr Monahan's
 
01:32:01.490 --> 01:32:01.500 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet Oh Oh I thought where where
 
01:32:04.129 --> 01:32:04.139 align:start position:0%
they've said they need 35 million a year
 
01:32:07.010 --> 01:32:07.020 align:start position:0%
for the next two years and they explain
 
01:32:10.490 --> 01:32:10.500 align:start position:0%
why yep and I'm I and I had until today
 
01:32:13.729 --> 01:32:13.739 align:start position:0%
thought that that 35 million a year
 
01:32:16.010 --> 01:32:16.020 align:start position:0%
could be satisfied largely if not
 
01:32:18.590 --> 01:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
entirely by the amount of money that's
 
01:32:20.870 --> 01:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
in the current year that's being carried
 
01:32:23.330 --> 01:32:23.340 align:start position:0%
into the next that's why I asked Mrs
 
01:32:26.810 --> 01:32:26.820 align:start position:0%
Horgan if she knew
 
01:32:30.470 --> 01:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
if that 35 million was
 
01:32:32.510 --> 01:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
based on knowing
 
01:32:35.450 --> 01:32:35.460 align:start position:0%
the carryover was going to take place or
 
01:32:37.629 --> 01:32:37.639 align:start position:0%
if that was yet intended to be
 
01:32:40.850 --> 01:32:40.860 align:start position:0%
incremental money still I understood no
 
01:32:44.149 --> 01:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
so so I I would assume just just looking
 
01:32:45.890 --> 01:32:45.900 align:start position:0%
at this that that this would be an
 
01:32:47.810 --> 01:32:47.820 align:start position:0%
increase above the current amounts that
 
01:32:50.750 --> 01:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
are budgeted okay so the bottom line is
 
01:32:53.570 --> 01:32:53.580 align:start position:0%
I can't count on the carryover in the
 
01:32:56.270 --> 01:32:56.280 align:start position:0%
current budget to address any of this 35
 
01:32:59.330 --> 01:32:59.340 align:start position:0%
million is that is that your conclusion
 
01:32:59.340 --> 01:33:01.250 align:start position:0%
million is that is that your conclusion
if

01:33:01.250 --> 01:33:01.260 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:33:03.110 --> 01:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
you guys don't like conclusion
 
01:33:06.770 --> 01:33:06.780 align:start position:0%
statements right like yes no we we don't
 
01:33:08.209 --> 01:33:08.219 align:start position:0%
do yes no's
 
01:33:11.870 --> 01:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
um so if if you were to reduce the
 
01:33:13.490 --> 01:33:13.500 align:start position:0%
service levels you would assume that
 
01:33:16.129 --> 01:33:16.139 align:start position:0%
those Services wouldn't be provided
 
01:33:17.450 --> 01:33:17.460 align:start position:0%
um or that there wouldn't be providers
 
01:33:19.010 --> 01:33:19.020 align:start position:0%
in the community to be able to provide
 
01:33:21.350 --> 01:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
those Services I think that's there is a
 
01:33:23.689 --> 01:33:23.699 align:start position:0%
requirement under 171a that requires the
 
01:33:26.090 --> 01:33:26.100 align:start position:0%
legislature and and the agency when we
 
01:33:28.070 --> 01:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
submit our budget to fully fund the
 
01:33:31.129 --> 01:33:31.139 align:start position:0%
those those services so that's I I just
 
01:33:32.510 --> 01:33:32.520 align:start position:0%
want to put that out there
 
01:33:34.250 --> 01:33:34.260 align:start position:0%
do you understand what he's saying no
 
01:33:36.590 --> 01:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
okay here's what he's saying they're
 
01:33:39.830 --> 01:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
required by law to fully fund all the
 
01:33:42.709 --> 01:33:42.719 align:start position:0%
services even knowing there's no way
 
01:33:44.330 --> 01:33:44.340 align:start position:0%
they're going to be able to deliver all
 
01:33:45.530 --> 01:33:45.540 align:start position:0%
those services
 
01:33:47.810 --> 01:33:47.820 align:start position:0%
so the reality is there is there are
 
01:33:50.090 --> 01:33:50.100 align:start position:0%
funds there that could be put into work
 
01:33:52.430 --> 01:33:52.440 align:start position:0%
at other places where the services can
 
01:33:54.229 --> 01:33:54.239 align:start position:0%
be funded for instance in the nursing
 
01:33:56.209 --> 01:33:56.219 align:start position:0%
homes so we need to be a little careful
 
01:33:59.270 --> 01:33:59.280 align:start position:0%
about that whole thing you know I might
 
01:34:01.610 --> 01:34:01.620 align:start position:0%
suggest and I don't want to end up your
 
01:34:04.490 --> 01:34:04.500 align:start position:0%
flow here but we have a big list here
 
01:34:06.890 --> 01:34:06.900 align:start position:0%
some of these things might be easy and I
 
01:34:08.930 --> 01:34:08.940 align:start position:0%
understand Mr lipman's here today I get
 
01:34:10.310 --> 01:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
that but he might be able to come back
 
01:34:12.530 --> 01:34:12.540 align:start position:0%
again at a later point in time because
 
01:34:13.850 --> 01:34:13.860 align:start position:0%
there might be some things we could just
 
01:34:16.070 --> 01:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
like tick off of here perhaps because
 
01:34:18.169 --> 01:34:18.179 align:start position:0%
this is a this clearly is like I would
 
01:34:19.490 --> 01:34:19.500 align:start position:0%
say the last
 
01:34:22.610 --> 01:34:22.620 align:start position:0%
once we in my opinion once we've
 
01:34:24.649 --> 01:34:24.659 align:start position:0%
addressed everything else we'll have an
 
01:34:26.750 --> 01:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
idea where we stand in terms of funds
 
01:34:29.209 --> 01:34:29.219 align:start position:0%
and we can then go and say okay now how
 
01:34:30.669 --> 01:34:30.679 align:start position:0%
do we do this
 
01:34:33.649 --> 01:34:33.659 align:start position:0%
how do we decide to give it to them to
 
01:34:36.250 --> 01:34:36.260 align:start position:0%
handle it as maybe Mr Singham
 
01:34:39.350 --> 01:34:39.360 align:start position:0%
believes or try to design it ourselves
 
01:34:41.270 --> 01:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
or whatever but this is obviously a huge
 
01:34:44.090 --> 01:34:44.100 align:start position:0%
problem this this Monahan thing it is
 
01:34:48.229 --> 01:34:48.239 align:start position:0%
and so what my intent was here was to to
 
01:34:51.530 --> 01:34:51.540 align:start position:0%
fully get it out there because we're not
 
01:34:53.570 --> 01:34:53.580 align:start position:0%
going to agree I know at the end of the
 
01:34:56.930 --> 01:34:56.940 align:start position:0%
day we're not going to agree so so I
 
01:34:58.729 --> 01:34:58.739 align:start position:0%
want to make it so that everyone is
 
01:35:01.189 --> 01:35:01.199 align:start position:0%
clear enough on the information so they
 
01:35:03.830 --> 01:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
can everyone can go caucus and and
 
01:35:05.930 --> 01:35:05.940 align:start position:0%
figure out the two big questions which
 
01:35:08.990 --> 01:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
is how much money and and are we going
 
01:35:10.910 --> 01:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
to Target it or not and if we target it
 
01:35:13.010 --> 01:35:13.020 align:start position:0%
you know so so I'm just trying to get
 
01:35:15.350 --> 01:35:15.360 align:start position:0%
enough discussion out there to put that
 
01:35:17.750 --> 01:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
canoe in the water so we can come back
 
01:35:20.810 --> 01:35:20.820 align:start position:0%
on Monday and find the extent to which
 
01:35:22.250 --> 01:35:22.260 align:start position:0%
we disagree
 
01:35:23.750 --> 01:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
I think you've done a good job of that
 
01:35:27.590 --> 01:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
okay all right I'm really really good at
 
01:35:29.510 --> 01:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
learning how to disagree with people
 
01:35:33.169 --> 01:35:33.179 align:start position:0%
that's my strong point this week so
 
01:35:36.709 --> 01:35:36.719 align:start position:0%
um okay uh
 
01:35:39.290 --> 01:35:39.300 align:start position:0%
so what other of these line items did we
 
01:35:41.629 --> 01:35:41.639 align:start position:0%
talk about you know like for example
 
01:35:43.430 --> 01:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
where they oh go ahead represent a
 
01:35:45.470 --> 01:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
Stringham I just want to talk about one
 
01:35:49.010 --> 01:35:49.020 align:start position:0%
that uh it would definitely be a high
 
01:35:50.450 --> 01:35:50.460 align:start position:0%
priority for me and that is the
 
01:35:53.510 --> 01:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
ambulance uh Service rates uh we've lost
 
01:35:55.910 --> 01:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
three ambulance providers since uh we
 
01:35:59.330 --> 01:35:59.340 align:start position:0%
first met as a group uh bethlehem's uh
 
01:36:01.790 --> 01:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
Ambulance Service shut down in the last
 
01:36:05.709 --> 01:36:05.719 align:start position:0%
three weeks a major uh Ambulance Company
 
01:36:08.450 --> 01:36:08.460 align:start position:0%
went out of business in January and
 
01:36:13.550 --> 01:36:13.560 align:start position:0%
Laconia stopped servicing and um uh the
 
01:36:15.709 --> 01:36:15.719 align:start position:0%
the rates are a big part of the problem
 
01:36:19.189 --> 01:36:19.199 align:start position:0%
for that the way I looked at it I
 
01:36:20.689 --> 01:36:20.699 align:start position:0%
actually went down to the individual
 
01:36:23.510 --> 01:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
service codes and I have have
 
01:36:26.390 --> 01:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
recommendations that are somewhat above
 
01:36:28.390 --> 01:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
the Medicare rates
 
01:36:30.770 --> 01:36:30.780 align:start position:0%
but we'd be looking at a couple of
 
01:36:32.750 --> 01:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
million dollars to maybe boost up that
 
01:36:35.330 --> 01:36:35.340 align:start position:0%
system a bit so let's talk about that a
 
01:36:37.790 --> 01:36:37.800 align:start position:0%
moment I in when I Point thought I had
 
01:36:39.770 --> 01:36:39.780 align:start position:0%
40 million to spread across the 100
 
01:36:42.530 --> 01:36:42.540 align:start position:0%
million in requests I've fully funded
 
01:36:44.930 --> 01:36:44.940 align:start position:0%
the ambulance because I I you know if
 
01:36:46.490 --> 01:36:46.500 align:start position:0%
you can't get people from point A to
 
01:36:48.050 --> 01:36:48.060 align:start position:0%
point B it doesn't matter what kind of
 
01:36:50.629 --> 01:36:50.639 align:start position:0%
capacity you're building so
 
01:36:54.709 --> 01:36:54.719 align:start position:0%
um I I I am in a line with um with you
 
01:36:57.050 --> 01:36:57.060 align:start position:0%
and I was just going to put the 2.2 in
 
01:36:58.970 --> 01:36:58.980 align:start position:0%
there uh per year
 
01:37:01.310 --> 01:37:01.320 align:start position:0%
um and figure out how to allocate the
 
01:37:04.490 --> 01:37:04.500 align:start position:0%
rest of it so I I you I mean you still
 
01:37:07.490 --> 01:37:07.500 align:start position:0%
have your caucus uh but uh the
 
01:37:09.110 --> 01:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
Republican caucus when we talked about
 
01:37:11.990 --> 01:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
this seemed like we were okay funding
 
01:37:16.790 --> 01:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
that ambulance service right okay so so
 
01:37:20.629 --> 01:37:20.639 align:start position:0%
so if you if you have some details that
 
01:37:23.689 --> 01:37:23.699 align:start position:0%
you want to like start flushing out I I
 
01:37:26.090 --> 01:37:26.100 align:start position:0%
think it'd be fine for you to start
 
01:37:28.129 --> 01:37:28.139 align:start position:0%
talking to you know Mr Ripple because
 
01:37:32.689 --> 01:37:32.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:34.490 --> 01:37:34.500 align:start position:0%
I can do that
 
01:37:37.129 --> 01:37:37.139 align:start position:0%
you have any disagreement with that no
 
01:37:37.139 --> 01:37:45.050 align:start position:0%
you have any disagreement with that no
okay

01:37:45.050 --> 01:37:45.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:47.750 --> 01:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
I'm sort of all over the place and I had
 
01:37:49.669 --> 01:37:49.679 align:start position:0%
such a methodical way of doing this
 
01:37:49.679 --> 01:37:51.050 align:start position:0%
such a methodical way of doing this
initially

01:37:51.050 --> 01:37:51.060 align:start position:0%
initially
 
01:37:53.330 --> 01:37:53.340 align:start position:0%
I I don't think we know what we need to
 
01:37:55.370 --> 01:37:55.380 align:start position:0%
know about the DD and brain injury money
 
01:37:58.250 --> 01:37:58.260 align:start position:0%
so because I think you've been looking
 
01:38:00.530 --> 01:38:00.540 align:start position:0%
at this and you're tying it in with a
 
01:38:01.850 --> 01:38:01.860 align:start position:0%
county cap
 
01:38:04.490 --> 01:38:04.500 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll let you talk about it well I
 
01:38:05.629 --> 01:38:05.639 align:start position:0%
don't need to talk about that what I'll
 
01:38:07.129 --> 01:38:07.139 align:start position:0%
say is this
 
01:38:08.450 --> 01:38:08.460 align:start position:0%
I don't think we need to concern
 
01:38:10.310 --> 01:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
ourselves with the DD money you mean
 
01:38:11.270 --> 01:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
you're talking about the money that's
 
01:38:13.370 --> 01:38:13.380 align:start position:0%
lapsing or not lapsing but rolling over
 
01:38:16.129 --> 01:38:16.139 align:start position:0%
from this current biennium and the
 
01:38:17.990 --> 01:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps excess money that's built into
 
01:38:19.850 --> 01:38:19.860 align:start position:0%
the budget because it's fully funded for
 
01:38:22.070 --> 01:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
services that won't be rendered those
 
01:38:24.229 --> 01:38:24.239 align:start position:0%
are dollars that need to be decided
 
01:38:25.550 --> 01:38:25.560 align:start position:0%
about how they're going to be allocated
 
01:38:27.290 --> 01:38:27.300 align:start position:0%
along with other places we're going to
 
01:38:30.050 --> 01:38:30.060 align:start position:0%
find dollars I I think if we can get
 
01:38:33.590 --> 01:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
through the majority of this list
 
01:38:35.930 --> 01:38:35.940 align:start position:0%
which Mr Ripple handed out at the very
 
01:38:38.689 --> 01:38:38.699 align:start position:0%
beginning before we get to I mean you've
 
01:38:40.370 --> 01:38:40.380 align:start position:0%
done a good I I I'm glad you did what
 
01:38:42.110 --> 01:38:42.120 align:start position:0%
you did in terms of the Monahan thing
 
01:38:43.729 --> 01:38:43.739 align:start position:0%
but I think we all kind of I think on
 
01:38:46.189 --> 01:38:46.199 align:start position:0%
both sides of the aisle so to speak we
 
01:38:47.570 --> 01:38:47.580 align:start position:0%
have an idea of the issues if you can
 
01:38:49.610 --> 01:38:49.620 align:start position:0%
indulge me for five more minutes I think
 
01:38:52.070 --> 01:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
that I can come off of this spreadsheet
 
01:38:53.390 --> 01:38:53.400 align:start position:0%
all together well that's fine did you
 
01:38:54.590 --> 01:38:54.600 align:start position:0%
understand where I was going though in
 
01:38:56.030 --> 01:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
terms of yeah we're going to go back to
 
01:38:58.430 --> 01:38:58.440 align:start position:0%
the full H well no but my tent was to
 
01:38:59.810 --> 01:38:59.820 align:start position:0%
point out that what we're talking about
 
01:39:01.910 --> 01:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
with the Monahan thing is how many
 
01:39:03.770 --> 01:39:03.780 align:start position:0%
dollars do we have and how do we
 
01:39:06.530 --> 01:39:06.540 align:start position:0%
allocate okay so one of the to answer
 
01:39:08.689 --> 01:39:08.699 align:start position:0%
the Muhammad dollars we have apart we
 
01:39:10.070 --> 01:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
could get through this and then we'd
 
01:39:11.330 --> 01:39:11.340 align:start position:0%
have it because if we have like a
 
01:39:12.649 --> 01:39:12.659 align:start position:0%
bazillion dollars we can all just say
 
01:39:14.410 --> 01:39:14.420 align:start position:0%
hey let's just go wild
 
01:39:16.910 --> 01:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
but if we only have Brazilian dollars
 
01:39:18.530 --> 01:39:18.540 align:start position:0%
but if we have something less than a
 
01:39:20.390 --> 01:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
bazillion you know then we'll have their
 
01:39:22.490 --> 01:39:22.500 align:start position:0%
conversation about how we divvy it up
 
01:39:25.070 --> 01:39:25.080 align:start position:0%
all right so so just to finish this
 
01:39:27.890 --> 01:39:27.900 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet community health centers in
 
01:39:30.110 --> 01:39:30.120 align:start position:0%
the rebasing and rate adjustment they
 
01:39:32.990 --> 01:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
they want six and six for the rebasing
 
01:39:35.750 --> 01:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
and and I and what I understand that to
 
01:39:38.750 --> 01:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
be is that over time our Medicaid
 
01:39:41.090 --> 01:39:41.100 align:start position:0%
payment framework gets a little further
 
01:39:43.010 --> 01:39:43.020 align:start position:0%
and further out of alignment with where
 
01:39:45.470 --> 01:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
it should be relative to Medicare and so
 
01:39:47.689 --> 01:39:47.699 align:start position:0%
rebasing it is would throw some more
 
01:39:49.689 --> 01:39:49.699 align:start position:0%
money just into the Medicaid
 
01:39:53.030 --> 01:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
reimbursement framework to get things
 
01:39:55.010 --> 01:39:55.020 align:start position:0%
back where they
 
01:39:57.970 --> 01:39:57.980 align:start position:0%
ought to have been if we hadn't been
 
01:40:00.290 --> 01:40:00.300 align:start position:0%
spreading out over time
 
01:40:03.530 --> 01:40:03.540 align:start position:0%
so so I I think so much of our problem
 
01:40:06.310 --> 01:40:06.320 align:start position:0%
in the state is our Medicaid
 
01:40:10.490 --> 01:40:10.500 align:start position:0%
reimbursements are so low that it
 
01:40:13.430 --> 01:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
creates dysfunction that then just gets
 
01:40:15.250 --> 01:40:15.260 align:start position:0%
Amplified throughout the health system
 
01:40:17.930 --> 01:40:17.940 align:start position:0%
so I would like to try to fix the
 
01:40:20.510 --> 01:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
Medicaid system a little bit more this
 
01:40:22.550 --> 01:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
rebasing would be fundamental to doing
 
01:40:25.610 --> 01:40:25.620 align:start position:0%
that so I I would prioritize the 6
 
01:40:28.310 --> 01:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
million for the rebasing and they asked
 
01:40:31.790 --> 01:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
for 4 million in a rate adjustment that
 
01:40:34.729 --> 01:40:34.739 align:start position:0%
I I'm not sure how that fits in with the
 
01:40:36.950 --> 01:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
overall issue but and then on the
 
01:40:39.110 --> 01:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
midwives this is such a tiny amount of
 
01:40:42.050 --> 01:40:42.060 align:start position:0%
money and we lost that birthing center
 
01:40:45.350 --> 01:40:45.360 align:start position:0%
up north and I I would just I would just
 
01:40:47.689 --> 01:40:47.699 align:start position:0%
agree I would spend the hundred thousand
 
01:40:50.090 --> 01:40:50.100 align:start position:0%
on the providers and spend the quarter
 
01:40:53.750 --> 01:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
million on the birth centers and because
 
01:40:56.870 --> 01:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
that's tiny money and and babies matter
 
01:40:59.870 --> 01:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
so so that's it I'm sort of done talking
 
01:41:03.050 --> 01:41:03.060 align:start position:0%
about this spreadsheet when when we come
 
01:41:05.450 --> 01:41:05.460 align:start position:0%
back on Monday kind of what I'd like to
 
01:41:09.590 --> 01:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
be able to do is just
 
01:41:12.050 --> 01:41:12.060 align:start position:0%
hear how much money you that we want to
 
01:41:16.070 --> 01:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
spend I I'm I'm saying 40 maybe I'm
 
01:41:18.709 --> 01:41:18.719 align:start position:0%
actually saying 50.6 if we reach back
 
01:41:21.950 --> 01:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
and grab the hospital's 3.1 share but
 
01:41:23.810 --> 01:41:23.820 align:start position:0%
but that's that's how I'm sort of
 
01:41:26.270 --> 01:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
targeting the amount you guys have a
 
01:41:28.250 --> 01:41:28.260 align:start position:0%
different way of doing it
 
01:41:30.770 --> 01:41:30.780 align:start position:0%
um and and I've just laid out for you
 
01:41:34.010 --> 01:41:34.020 align:start position:0%
how I would prioritize this document we
 
01:41:35.750 --> 01:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
didn't talk about Pharmacy or durable
 
01:41:37.850 --> 01:41:37.860 align:start position:0%
medical equipment but I've been
 
01:41:40.070 --> 01:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
encouraged to move on
 
01:41:40.080 --> 01:41:41.330 align:start position:0%
encouraged to move on
so

01:41:41.330 --> 01:41:41.340 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:41:43.490 --> 01:41:43.500 align:start position:0%
speak speak to Pharmacy and durable
 
01:41:44.990 --> 01:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
equipment if
 
01:41:47.030 --> 01:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
we need to go further into that I don't
 
01:41:48.350 --> 01:41:48.360 align:start position:0%
want to cut you off I just wanted to
 
01:41:50.330 --> 01:41:50.340 align:start position:0%
learn no no no I haven't allocated any
 
01:41:52.370 --> 01:41:52.380 align:start position:0%
money for pharmacy and durable medical
 
01:41:54.530 --> 01:41:54.540 align:start position:0%
equipment in this and in order to
 
01:41:57.770 --> 01:41:57.780 align:start position:0%
community ask for it so I didn't wasn't
 
01:42:00.350 --> 01:42:00.360 align:start position:0%
aware of it it makes sense
 
01:42:04.550 --> 01:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
those are really big dollars so go ahead
 
01:42:06.010 --> 01:42:06.020 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
01:42:09.050 --> 01:42:09.060 align:start position:0%
so under our federable medical equipment
 
01:42:11.510 --> 01:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
under our Managed Care Program because
 
01:42:13.790 --> 01:42:13.800 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of commoditization of
 
01:42:16.209 --> 01:42:16.219 align:start position:0%
durable medical equipment
 
01:42:16.219 --> 01:42:18.129 align:start position:0%
durable medical equipment
we

01:42:18.129 --> 01:42:18.139 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:42:22.550 --> 01:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
pay we have as a floor that the mcos can
 
01:42:26.870 --> 01:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
pay uh 80 percent of Medicaid fee
 
01:42:29.750 --> 01:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
schedule so what's happened in the DME
 
01:42:32.030 --> 01:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
space is that a lot of the providers are
 
01:42:33.530 --> 01:42:33.540 align:start position:0%
getting below
 
01:42:35.510 --> 01:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
what the Medicaid fee schedule is
 
01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:36.830 align:start position:0%
what the Medicaid fee schedule is
because

01:42:36.830 --> 01:42:36.840 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:42:40.790 --> 01:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
some of the large contracts can can get
 
01:42:43.370 --> 01:42:43.380 align:start position:0%
it for dirt cheap and what what I've
 
01:42:45.050 --> 01:42:45.060 align:start position:0%
heard from the
 
01:42:47.870 --> 01:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
um the DME network over time is that
 
01:42:50.090 --> 01:42:50.100 align:start position:0%
they would like the minimum fee schedule
 
01:42:52.250 --> 01:42:52.260 align:start position:0%
to be the minimum Medicaid fee schedule
 
01:42:55.910 --> 01:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
which from a couple years ago that was
 
01:42:58.270 --> 01:42:58.280 align:start position:0%
probably about a three million dollar
 
01:43:04.010 --> 01:43:04.020 align:start position:0%
issue to to bring rates back to the full
 
01:43:06.890 --> 01:43:06.900 align:start position:0%
Medicaid fee schedule but the the issue
 
01:43:09.649 --> 01:43:09.659 align:start position:0%
with DME is like the easy stuff
 
01:43:12.709 --> 01:43:12.719 align:start position:0%
um is been commoditized when you want to
 
01:43:14.149 --> 01:43:14.159 align:start position:0%
try to get someone to go to the North
 
01:43:17.570 --> 01:43:17.580 align:start position:0%
Country to see that one person or to to
 
01:43:20.090 --> 01:43:20.100 align:start position:0%
do some of the if you will I almost
 
01:43:22.250 --> 01:43:22.260 align:start position:0%
think of it like what goes on with the
 
01:43:24.649 --> 01:43:24.659 align:start position:0%
mail delivery and and delivery of
 
01:43:25.970 --> 01:43:25.980 align:start position:0%
packages that there's a certain
 
01:43:28.910 --> 01:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
component that the the in-state
 
01:43:31.250 --> 01:43:31.260 align:start position:0%
providers are sort of like the U.S mail
 
01:43:32.570 --> 01:43:32.580 align:start position:0%
in the sense that they have to go to
 
01:43:35.570 --> 01:43:35.580 align:start position:0%
Every household or they try to anyways
 
01:43:37.729 --> 01:43:37.739 align:start position:0%
and and some of the other d me products
 
01:43:39.470 --> 01:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
are just more you know you can get them
 
01:43:41.090 --> 01:43:41.100 align:start position:0%
through Amazon or something like that
 
01:43:43.129 --> 01:43:43.139 align:start position:0%
it's I mean I'm just using analogies
 
01:43:44.149 --> 01:43:44.159 align:start position:0%
here not
 
01:43:45.890 --> 01:43:45.900 align:start position:0%
direct things but that's that's what's
 
01:43:48.169 --> 01:43:48.179 align:start position:0%
happening I think to the DME providers
 
01:43:50.390 --> 01:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
that they're looking for that to be
 
01:43:53.570 --> 01:43:53.580 align:start position:0%
where they want to get to we we did when
 
01:43:55.430 --> 01:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
we did the procurement
 
01:43:55.440 --> 01:43:56.090 align:start position:0%
we did the procurement
um

01:43:56.090 --> 01:43:56.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:57.530 --> 01:43:57.540 align:start position:0%
they were getting paid less than 80
 
01:43:58.850 --> 01:43:58.860 align:start position:0%
percent by
 
01:44:06.890 --> 01:44:06.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:08.930 --> 01:44:08.940 align:start position:0%
okay do you have any comments on
 
01:44:08.940 --> 01:44:10.450 align:start position:0%
okay do you have any comments on
Pharmacy

01:44:10.450 --> 01:44:10.460 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy
 
01:44:14.450 --> 01:44:14.460 align:start position:0%
I think in terms of uh Pharmacy just to
 
01:44:16.370 --> 01:44:16.380 align:start position:0%
give you some sense of the scale in the
 
01:44:18.350 --> 01:44:18.360 align:start position:0%
in the Health Care Program it's a it's
 
01:44:20.990 --> 01:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
approaching 20 percent of the spend
 
01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:21.609 align:start position:0%
approaching 20 percent of the spend
um

01:44:21.609 --> 01:44:21.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:21.619 --> 01:44:23.209 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:44:23.209 --> 01:44:23.219 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:44:26.870 --> 01:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
um you know again here in terms of what
 
01:44:26.880 --> 01:44:30.229 align:start position:0%
um you know again here in terms of what
uh

01:44:30.229 --> 01:44:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:31.790 --> 01:44:31.800 align:start position:0%
the way I think it affects the local
 
01:44:34.729 --> 01:44:34.739 align:start position:0%
pharmacies is what what what they get in
 
01:44:37.310 --> 01:44:37.320 align:start position:0%
terms of dispensing fees for from the
 
01:44:40.550 --> 01:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
mcos in terms of allowances there that
 
01:44:43.430 --> 01:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
the the drugs are bought on a more of a
 
01:44:44.870 --> 01:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
national Market I guess I want to jump
 
01:44:46.970 --> 01:44:46.980 align:start position:0%
to the bottom line is the money to pay
 
01:44:49.729 --> 01:44:49.739 align:start position:0%
for the extra Pharmacy costs already in
 
01:44:51.410 --> 01:44:51.420 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget or do we need to
 
01:44:53.510 --> 01:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
go find some additional money to pay for
 
01:44:55.310 --> 01:44:55.320 align:start position:0%
the additional Pharmacy expense we're
 
01:44:55.320 --> 01:44:56.629 align:start position:0%
the additional Pharmacy expense we're
anticipating

01:44:56.629 --> 01:44:56.639 align:start position:0%
anticipating
 
01:45:00.709 --> 01:45:00.719 align:start position:0%
I've not to be give you sort of a yes or
 
01:45:03.590 --> 01:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
no answer that I think yes it's in it's
 
01:45:06.890 --> 01:45:06.900 align:start position:0%
in there but I I can say that you know a
 
01:45:09.109 --> 01:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
large in large measure the independent
 
01:45:11.330 --> 01:45:11.340 align:start position:0%
pharmacies have largely disappeared and
 
01:45:13.790 --> 01:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
that the the way the the pharmaceutical
 
01:45:16.370 --> 01:45:16.380 align:start position:0%
business is going is that more narrow
 
01:45:18.350 --> 01:45:18.360 align:start position:0%
networks are being developed to to
 
01:45:20.629 --> 01:45:20.639 align:start position:0%
accommodate the the efficiencies that
 
01:45:21.890 --> 01:45:21.900 align:start position:0%
are needed to work within the current
 
01:45:21.900 --> 01:45:24.890 align:start position:0%
are needed to work within the current
budgets

01:45:24.890 --> 01:45:24.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:27.470 --> 01:45:27.480 align:start position:0%
so I guess the answer is I think that we
 
01:45:29.530 --> 01:45:29.540 align:start position:0%
feel that we can acquire the pharmacies
 
01:45:31.609 --> 01:45:31.619 align:start position:0%
Pharmaceuticals we need and deliver them
 
01:45:34.189 --> 01:45:34.199 align:start position:0%
with the budget that we have that being
 
01:45:36.410 --> 01:45:36.420 align:start position:0%
said I think if you talk to the few
 
01:45:38.330 --> 01:45:38.340 align:start position:0%
remaining Independent Pharmacies they
 
01:45:40.310 --> 01:45:40.320 align:start position:0%
would feel like they're they're probably
 
01:45:42.530 --> 01:45:42.540 align:start position:0%
just hanging on do you have a comment
 
01:45:44.450 --> 01:45:44.460 align:start position:0%
there representative stream because what
 
01:45:46.850 --> 01:45:46.860 align:start position:0%
I think the summary of that is we don't
 
01:45:48.709 --> 01:45:48.719 align:start position:0%
need to be looking to put more money in
 
01:45:51.290 --> 01:45:51.300 align:start position:0%
the pharmacy and and that if we did
 
01:45:52.790 --> 01:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
anything with the durable medical
 
01:45:54.590 --> 01:45:54.600 align:start position:0%
equipment it'd be a three million dollar
 
01:45:57.950 --> 01:45:57.960 align:start position:0%
bill yeah the the DME is a relatively
 
01:46:00.770 --> 01:46:00.780 align:start position:0%
minor part the pharmacy we probably
 
01:46:03.109 --> 01:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
don't have to address it in the budget
 
01:46:05.570 --> 01:46:05.580 align:start position:0%
from what I'm hearing here uh with
 
01:46:07.430 --> 01:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
additional Appropriations but I will say
 
01:46:11.450 --> 01:46:11.460 align:start position:0%
the pharmacy processes are a lot more
 
01:46:13.550 --> 01:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
difficult to control we heard testimony
 
01:46:16.729 --> 01:46:16.739 align:start position:0%
about pending drugs that may cost two
 
01:46:19.250 --> 01:46:19.260 align:start position:0%
million dollars for a single patient and
 
01:46:20.990 --> 01:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
being covered under the Medicaid Program
 
01:46:23.510 --> 01:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure we have the checks and
 
01:46:25.609 --> 01:46:25.619 align:start position:0%
balances and
 
01:46:29.229 --> 01:46:29.239 align:start position:0%
um uh budget type of controls in place
 
01:46:31.609 --> 01:46:31.619 align:start position:0%
to be dealing with that but that would
 
01:46:34.729 --> 01:46:34.739 align:start position:0%
certainly be outside of of uh approving
 
01:46:38.510 --> 01:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
hb2 and uh a responsible budget for the
 
01:46:40.370 --> 01:46:40.380 align:start position:0%
next biennium
 
01:46:42.950 --> 01:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
so so I think there are some processes
 
01:46:44.950 --> 01:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
in place to where these really
 
01:46:48.649 --> 01:46:48.659 align:start position:0%
budget-breaking kinds of new drugs get a
 
01:46:50.270 --> 01:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
review and they get a clinical
 
01:46:52.790 --> 01:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness assessment the research
 
01:46:54.169 --> 01:46:54.179 align:start position:0%
has looked at and
 
01:46:57.410 --> 01:46:57.420 align:start position:0%
but but even with those things in place
 
01:47:00.169 --> 01:47:00.179 align:start position:0%
I'm nervous that we're going to like
 
01:47:02.570 --> 01:47:02.580 align:start position:0%
blow out our budget at some point
 
01:47:05.810 --> 01:47:05.820 align:start position:0%
because we need tighter control still
 
01:47:09.229 --> 01:47:09.239 align:start position:0%
do you have any thoughts on that yes
 
01:47:09.239 --> 01:47:10.490 align:start position:0%
do you have any thoughts on that yes
um

01:47:10.490 --> 01:47:10.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:12.410 --> 01:47:12.420 align:start position:0%
we've been working and preparing for the
 
01:47:15.830 --> 01:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
next procurement on we've got sort of
 
01:47:17.689 --> 01:47:17.699 align:start position:0%
mapped out when we expect all these
 
01:47:19.850 --> 01:47:19.860 align:start position:0%
different and I could share that at
 
01:47:22.189 --> 01:47:22.199 align:start position:0%
another occasion with you in terms of
 
01:47:24.669 --> 01:47:24.679 align:start position:0%
when all these potentially very large
 
01:47:27.709 --> 01:47:27.719 align:start position:0%
you know million two million dollar dose
 
01:47:29.930 --> 01:47:29.940 align:start position:0%
type of treatments are scheduled to be
 
01:47:33.890 --> 01:47:33.900 align:start position:0%
on board we we fortunately
 
01:47:36.290 --> 01:47:36.300 align:start position:0%
um and Medicaid can take some we're
 
01:47:38.030 --> 01:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
allowed six months once it's FDA
 
01:47:40.689 --> 01:47:40.699 align:start position:0%
approved to sort of work up the criteria
 
01:47:43.370 --> 01:47:43.380 align:start position:0%
and we're also looking at what other
 
01:47:45.530 --> 01:47:45.540 align:start position:0%
states are doing with our actuary in
 
01:47:48.590 --> 01:47:48.600 align:start position:0%
terms of how we can manage those costs
 
01:47:51.350 --> 01:47:51.360 align:start position:0%
uh potentially better but when I include
 
01:47:53.510 --> 01:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
talked about the three percent
 
01:47:55.970 --> 01:47:55.980 align:start position:0%
inflation factor that we built into our
 
01:47:57.950 --> 01:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
rates that's intended
 
01:48:00.649 --> 01:48:00.659 align:start position:0%
for the 24 and 25 period to cover where
 
01:48:02.750 --> 01:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
we think we can live with with respect
 
01:48:05.390 --> 01:48:05.400 align:start position:0%
to the budget in terms of those things
 
01:48:07.910 --> 01:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
longer term I think when you go beyond
 
01:48:11.330 --> 01:48:11.340 align:start position:0%
25 you know the momentum of these larger
 
01:48:15.050 --> 01:48:15.060 align:start position:0%
types of of therapies Gene therapies
 
01:48:16.010 --> 01:48:16.020 align:start position:0%
um you know we're going to need some
 
01:48:17.750 --> 01:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
other strategies I think in the next
 
01:48:20.570 --> 01:48:20.580 align:start position:0%
biennium budget Beyond this one
 
01:48:23.930 --> 01:48:23.940 align:start position:0%
and we are working on them so HHS
 
01:48:26.149 --> 01:48:26.159 align:start position:0%
oversight put in a bill to look at
 
01:48:29.570 --> 01:48:29.580 align:start position:0%
emerging medical Technologies and come
 
01:48:32.090 --> 01:48:32.100 align:start position:0%
up with policy recommendations and this
 
01:48:33.890 --> 01:48:33.900 align:start position:0%
was one of the reasons we thought that
 
01:48:35.810 --> 01:48:35.820 align:start position:0%
need was needed is because we've got
 
01:48:38.810 --> 01:48:38.820 align:start position:0%
these budget busting things in the on
 
01:48:42.649 --> 01:48:42.659 align:start position:0%
the horizon but okay so I I think we're
 
01:48:46.129 --> 01:48:46.139 align:start position:0%
closed on the the the Medicaid targeted
 
01:48:48.649 --> 01:48:48.659 align:start position:0%
rate reimbursement for now
 
01:48:48.659 --> 01:48:50.870 align:start position:0%
rate reimbursement for now
so

01:48:50.870 --> 01:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:48:53.390 --> 01:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
what would you like to do next
 
01:48:55.430 --> 01:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
I'm willing to just sit back and let you
 
01:49:00.649 --> 01:49:00.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:01.910 --> 01:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
you might want to have your Vice chair
 
01:49:04.370 --> 01:49:04.380 align:start position:0%
do that can she read your mind do you
 
01:49:09.790 --> 01:49:09.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:12.950 --> 01:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
go ahead you you you've been a vice
 
01:49:15.290 --> 01:49:15.300 align:start position:0%
chair you can do this well I would just
 
01:49:16.729 --> 01:49:16.739 align:start position:0%
go back to what Mr Lipman was and let
 
01:49:18.290 --> 01:49:18.300 align:start position:0%
him start I mean he you know started off
 
01:49:21.290 --> 01:49:21.300 align:start position:0%
with something and I think he's got
 
01:49:22.370 --> 01:49:22.380 align:start position:0%
the ability to go through the whole
 
01:49:25.910 --> 01:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
thing right am I mistaken about that
 
01:49:27.830 --> 01:49:27.840 align:start position:0%
I think you could go through this yes so
 
01:49:29.750 --> 01:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
I handed out a uh
 
01:49:31.970 --> 01:49:31.980 align:start position:0%
a house bill 2 tracking sheet of sorts
 
01:49:33.290 --> 01:49:33.300 align:start position:0%
and I apologize you've already seen
 
01:49:35.149 --> 01:49:35.159 align:start position:0%
several House Bill 2 summary sheets but
 
01:49:36.950 --> 01:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
what I would like to do going forward as
 
01:49:38.990 --> 01:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
the division meets each morning is
 
01:49:40.970 --> 01:49:40.980 align:start position:0%
update this with the action taken by the
 
01:49:43.970 --> 01:49:43.980 align:start position:0%
division uh so if a section has been
 
01:49:46.370 --> 01:49:46.380 align:start position:0%
approved we would show that if it's on
 
01:49:48.050 --> 01:49:48.060 align:start position:0%
hold we would show that if there are any
 
01:49:49.729 --> 01:49:49.739 align:start position:0%
amendments or it's been deleted we would
 
01:49:50.990 --> 01:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
show that
 
01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:51.709 align:start position:0%
show that
um

01:49:51.709 --> 01:49:51.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:54.890 --> 01:49:54.900 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure if the division is
 
01:49:57.830 --> 01:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
prepared to vote on these right now
 
01:49:57.840 --> 01:50:01.310 align:start position:0%
prepared to vote on these right now
um

01:50:01.310 --> 01:50:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:04.250 --> 01:50:04.260 align:start position:0%
but I guess what I would suggest
 
01:50:05.810 --> 01:50:05.820 align:start position:0%
in the case of House Bill 2 not
 
01:50:06.890 --> 01:50:06.900 align:start position:0%
necessarily in the case but of House
 
01:50:09.830 --> 01:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
Bill lawn is taking an affirmative vote
 
01:50:13.370 --> 01:50:13.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:15.350 --> 01:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
taking a vote to delete anything you
 
01:50:16.970 --> 01:50:16.980 align:start position:0%
would like to delete and taking a vote
 
01:50:18.290 --> 01:50:18.300 align:start position:0%
to amend anything you would like to
 
01:50:20.149 --> 01:50:20.159 align:start position:0%
amend and I do have a stack of potential
 
01:50:22.070 --> 01:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
amendments here and anything that you're
 
01:50:23.570 --> 01:50:23.580 align:start position:0%
not ready to vote on yet and you'd like
 
01:50:28.250 --> 01:50:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:30.470 --> 01:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
do you have an ordered stack or we just
 
01:50:32.570 --> 01:50:32.580 align:start position:0%
start going through or how do you it
 
01:50:34.550 --> 01:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
might it's not necessarily an order but
 
01:50:36.350 --> 01:50:36.360 align:start position:0%
I can I can try to rearrange it so yeah
 
01:50:37.609 --> 01:50:37.619 align:start position:0%
I think if you want to start with the
 
01:50:41.450 --> 01:50:41.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:43.609 --> 01:50:43.619 align:start position:0%
um I might see just just starting with
 
01:50:45.050 --> 01:50:45.060 align:start position:0%
the first item on the list and working
 
01:50:52.310 --> 01:50:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:55.609 --> 01:50:55.619 align:start position:0%
so um if you want to start with sections
 
01:50:58.189 --> 01:50:58.199 align:start position:0%
49 through 50 on page 20 of House Bill 2
 
01:51:00.709 --> 01:51:00.719 align:start position:0%
this is 1.5 million in fiscal 23 for
 
01:51:02.330 --> 01:51:02.340 align:start position:0%
juvenile peer-to-peer grief support
 
01:51:02.340 --> 01:51:05.450 align:start position:0%
juvenile peer-to-peer grief support
programming

01:51:05.450 --> 01:51:05.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:07.370 --> 01:51:07.380 align:start position:0%
so I'll give my opinion if you want me
 
01:51:09.770 --> 01:51:09.780 align:start position:0%
to speak first I I want you to share it
 
01:51:11.750 --> 01:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
for a while so this is where I'm
 
01:51:13.550 --> 01:51:13.560 align:start position:0%
starting I'm not sure what document
 
01:51:15.590 --> 01:51:15.600 align:start position:0%
we're looking at right now but but
 
01:51:17.510 --> 01:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
that's awesome so he handed that Mr
 
01:51:19.070 --> 01:51:19.080 align:start position:0%
Ripple handed out something that says at
 
01:51:21.490 --> 01:51:21.500 align:start position:0%
the top house finance division three
 
01:51:24.530 --> 01:51:24.540 align:start position:0%
actions related to hb2 as of March 17
 
01:51:24.540 --> 01:51:26.209 align:start position:0%
actions related to hb2 as of March 17
2023

01:51:26.209 --> 01:51:26.219 align:start position:0%
2023
 
01:51:29.570 --> 01:51:29.580 align:start position:0%
and it's a big long vertical list of
 
01:51:29.580 --> 01:51:30.709 align:start position:0%
and it's a big long vertical list of
about

01:51:30.709 --> 01:51:30.719 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:51:33.350 --> 01:51:33.360 align:start position:0%
I don't know 40 items from the from hb2
 
01:51:36.830 --> 01:51:36.840 align:start position:0%
starting with 60 49 15 going down to 254
 
01:51:38.390 --> 01:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
looks like this
 
01:51:41.330 --> 01:51:41.340 align:start position:0%
you you have that or no I I do uh just
 
01:51:43.370 --> 01:51:43.380 align:start position:0%
question is this kind of identical to
 
01:51:45.830 --> 01:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
the original sheet you gave us or
 
01:51:47.450 --> 01:51:47.460 align:start position:0%
something's been added and subtracted
 
01:51:49.189 --> 01:51:49.199 align:start position:0%
it's very similar and that's why I
 
01:51:50.810 --> 01:51:50.820 align:start position:0%
apologize for the overlap but going
 
01:51:52.669 --> 01:51:52.679 align:start position:0%
forward each morning I want to update it
 
01:51:54.290 --> 01:51:54.300 align:start position:0%
with the status of the division's action
 
01:51:55.790 --> 01:51:55.800 align:start position:0%
so that's why I started with a new
 
01:51:55.800 --> 01:51:57.590 align:start position:0%
so that's why I started with a new
format

01:51:57.590 --> 01:51:57.600 align:start position:0%
format
 
01:51:59.870 --> 01:51:59.880 align:start position:0%
does everybody have the
 
01:51:59.880 --> 01:52:01.010 align:start position:0%
does everybody have the
you

01:52:01.010 --> 01:52:01.020 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:52:02.629 --> 01:52:02.639 align:start position:0%
oh just didn't have it okay all right
 
01:52:05.270 --> 01:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
but how about the Mary Jane yeah
 
01:52:07.910 --> 01:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
okay okay Maureen
 
01:52:07.920 --> 01:52:14.930 align:start position:0%
okay okay Maureen
okay

01:52:14.930 --> 01:52:14.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:17.149 --> 01:52:17.159 align:start position:0%
so on that so on that first item
 
01:52:19.129 --> 01:52:19.139 align:start position:0%
sections 49 through 50 I'm not sure if
 
01:52:20.990 --> 01:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
the division is is prepared to act at
 
01:52:24.890 --> 01:52:24.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:26.930 --> 01:52:26.940 align:start position:0%
so I'll start back with my opinion I
 
01:52:28.910 --> 01:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
just assumed take this out but let's go
 
01:52:32.570 --> 01:52:32.580 align:start position:0%
on the room and get over his opinion
 
01:52:34.370 --> 01:52:34.380 align:start position:0%
and I'll just added this was put in with
 
01:52:37.310 --> 01:52:37.320 align:start position:0%
the governors I recall a not uh not
 
01:52:39.770 --> 01:52:39.780 align:start position:0%
originally by from DHHS not mistaken I'm
 
01:52:43.250 --> 01:52:43.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:45.590 --> 01:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
that was my question too is is this
 
01:52:47.689 --> 01:52:47.699 align:start position:0%
something that the the department has
 
01:52:47.699 --> 01:52:49.250 align:start position:0%
something that the the department has
been

01:52:49.250 --> 01:52:49.260 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:52:51.709 --> 01:52:51.719 align:start position:0%
funding previously
 
01:52:55.070 --> 01:52:55.080 align:start position:0%
um sure so so this was not a prioritized
 
01:52:57.290 --> 01:52:57.300 align:start position:0%
needs request um I do have Katya Fox
 
01:53:00.050 --> 01:53:00.060 align:start position:0%
here to to speak to this item if if
 
01:53:02.570 --> 01:53:02.580 align:start position:0%
you'd like additional information though
 
01:53:04.970 --> 01:53:04.980 align:start position:0%
I mean I would at least like a very
 
01:53:07.189 --> 01:53:07.199 align:start position:0%
short explanation of what it is bring
 
01:53:12.709 --> 01:53:12.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:15.070 --> 01:53:15.080 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am
 
01:53:19.550 --> 01:53:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:22.370 --> 01:53:22.380 align:start position:0%
it looks like this
 
01:53:26.390 --> 01:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
that sort of gives an explanation of
 
01:53:29.689 --> 01:53:29.699 align:start position:0%
what each one of these things is
 
01:53:31.970 --> 01:53:31.980 align:start position:0%
yes I'm I actually have my own version
 
01:53:34.430 --> 01:53:34.440 align:start position:0%
of it but yeah for everybody else if you
 
01:53:35.810 --> 01:53:35.820 align:start position:0%
don't have that it might help to bring
 
01:53:49.910 --> 01:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:53.090 --> 01:53:53.100 align:start position:0%
so um the response is we have not funded
 
01:53:56.270 --> 01:53:56.280 align:start position:0%
this in the past
 
01:53:57.770 --> 01:53:57.780 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:53:57.780 --> 01:53:58.970 align:start position:0%
um and
um

01:53:58.970 --> 01:53:58.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:01.189 --> 01:54:01.199 align:start position:0%
it was previously stated about where it
 
01:54:10.129 --> 01:54:10.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:12.830 --> 01:54:12.840 align:start position:0%
let me just ask if it was funded what
 
01:54:14.450 --> 01:54:14.460 align:start position:0%
would you do with it
 
01:54:16.490 --> 01:54:16.500 align:start position:0%
so we would
 
01:54:19.490 --> 01:54:19.500 align:start position:0%
um initiate a procurement process and
 
01:54:22.729 --> 01:54:22.739 align:start position:0%
solicit applications from eligible
 
01:54:26.390 --> 01:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
providers to provide this service for
 
01:54:34.010 --> 01:54:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:38.390 --> 01:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
yes sir so my my thought on this is that
 
01:54:41.990 --> 01:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh we we know that we're going to want
 
01:54:43.850 --> 01:54:43.860 align:start position:0%
to spend a lot more money than what we
 
01:54:45.950 --> 01:54:45.960 align:start position:0%
have and so occasionally we're going to
 
01:54:47.990 --> 01:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
have to make the hard decisions on on
 
01:54:50.390 --> 01:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
what not to fund and all this is not a
 
01:54:53.030 --> 01:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
lot of money it's a brand new program
 
01:54:54.830 --> 01:54:54.840 align:start position:0%
that's going to have some stumbling
 
01:54:57.649 --> 01:54:57.659 align:start position:0%
Growing Pains anyways before it can be
 
01:55:01.609 --> 01:55:01.619 align:start position:0%
effective I I I would rather take the
 
01:55:03.410 --> 01:55:03.420 align:start position:0%
limited amount of money we have and
 
01:55:06.109 --> 01:55:06.119 align:start position:0%
focus it as much as possible on Direct
 
01:55:09.590 --> 01:55:09.600 align:start position:0%
Health Care with with proven outcomes I
 
01:55:13.609 --> 01:55:13.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:16.129 --> 01:55:16.139 align:start position:0%
anybody for a straw vote is that a fair
 
01:55:17.930 --> 01:55:17.940 align:start position:0%
thing to ask at this point or is that
 
01:55:22.250 --> 01:55:22.260 align:start position:0%
too much for us to get to that point
 
01:55:24.530 --> 01:55:24.540 align:start position:0%
you may recall that representative
 
01:55:26.270 --> 01:55:26.280 align:start position:0%
Weiler wanted to be present for any of
 
01:55:30.109 --> 01:55:30.119 align:start position:0%
those kind of votes okay okay well
 
01:55:32.930 --> 01:55:32.940 align:start position:0%
yeah I see
 
01:55:35.570 --> 01:55:35.580 align:start position:0%
if I could just maybe
 
01:55:38.149 --> 01:55:38.159 align:start position:0%
um some of these things that we
 
01:55:41.629 --> 01:55:41.639 align:start position:0%
like this is a new program so maybe we
 
01:55:43.970 --> 01:55:43.980 align:start position:0%
want to put like a special Mark so we
 
01:55:46.609 --> 01:55:46.619 align:start position:0%
know we can go sort of go back
 
01:55:50.209 --> 01:55:50.219 align:start position:0%
and go over them when we see what we
 
01:55:52.729 --> 01:55:52.739 align:start position:0%
have when we get to the end
 
01:55:52.739 --> 01:55:54.229 align:start position:0%
have when we get to the end
yep

01:55:54.229 --> 01:55:54.239 align:start position:0%
yep
 
01:55:58.040 --> 01:55:58.050 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:58.050 --> 01:56:00.229 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

01:56:00.229 --> 01:56:00.239 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:56:01.729 --> 01:56:01.739 align:start position:0%
so so I think if the division doesn't
 
01:56:03.229 --> 01:56:03.239 align:start position:0%
vote on anything the division doesn't
 
01:56:06.109 --> 01:56:06.119 align:start position:0%
vote on today I'll mark As on hold for
 
01:56:07.609 --> 01:56:07.619 align:start position:0%
the next time I prepare this document
 
01:56:07.619 --> 01:56:09.169 align:start position:0%
the next time I prepare this document
okay

01:56:09.169 --> 01:56:09.179 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:56:09.179 --> 01:56:10.370 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

01:56:10.370 --> 01:56:10.380 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:56:10.380 --> 01:56:12.590 align:start position:0%
okay
so

01:56:12.590 --> 01:56:12.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:56:14.750 --> 01:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
if you're not ready to vote on 49 and 50
 
01:56:17.270 --> 01:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
we can move on to section 77 and 78
 
01:56:18.649 --> 01:56:18.659 align:start position:0%
which make a 10 million dollar
 
01:56:20.810 --> 01:56:20.820 align:start position:0%
appropriation of Das for the purpose of
 
01:56:22.910 --> 01:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
constructing a replacement facility for
 
01:56:24.890 --> 01:56:24.900 align:start position:0%
the sununu center and I do have an
 
01:56:26.390 --> 01:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
amendment for that
 
01:56:28.970 --> 01:56:28.980 align:start position:0%
that I'll hand out
 
01:56:30.470 --> 01:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
can I describe it while you're handing
 
01:56:31.490 --> 01:56:31.500 align:start position:0%
it out
 
01:56:33.770 --> 01:56:33.780 align:start position:0%
so the idea here this is 10 million of
 
01:56:36.109 --> 01:56:36.119 align:start position:0%
General funds the
 
01:56:39.169 --> 01:56:39.179 align:start position:0%
uh Governor's budget or hp2 I believe
 
01:56:41.270 --> 01:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
includes I don't includes that are not
 
01:56:43.070 --> 01:56:43.080 align:start position:0%
but the intention is that the rest would
 
01:56:45.229 --> 01:56:45.239 align:start position:0%
come from arpa funds the suggestion of
 
01:56:46.729 --> 01:56:46.739 align:start position:0%
this amendment it was we delete the 10
 
01:56:48.830 --> 01:56:48.840 align:start position:0%
million dollars of General funds from
 
01:56:51.050 --> 01:56:51.060 align:start position:0%
here and basically put through an
 
01:56:52.850 --> 01:56:52.860 align:start position:0%
amendment that says all the funds for
 
01:56:58.790 --> 01:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:02.330 --> 01:57:02.340 align:start position:0%
so go ahead sir so what happens if um
 
01:57:05.209 --> 01:57:05.219 align:start position:0%
there aren't enough arpa funds to fully
 
01:57:07.250 --> 01:57:07.260 align:start position:0%
fund the construction I would ask Mr
 
01:57:09.169 --> 01:57:09.179 align:start position:0%
Ripple to address that but he says if we
 
01:57:10.609 --> 01:57:10.619 align:start position:0%
pass it into law they'll have to
 
01:57:14.570 --> 01:57:14.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:34.750 --> 01:57:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:38.209 --> 01:57:38.219 align:start position:0%
and just to let you know I I'm I'm okay
 
01:57:40.609 --> 01:57:40.619 align:start position:0%
with that whole concept I all I know is
 
01:57:42.850 --> 01:57:42.860 align:start position:0%
the governor promised 15 million not
 
01:57:47.570 --> 01:57:47.580 align:start position:0%
21.6 and I just you know if we're going
 
01:57:50.209 --> 01:57:50.219 align:start position:0%
to hold them accountable for all 21.6 I
 
01:57:52.729 --> 01:57:52.739 align:start position:0%
just I'm curious what we think the odds
 
01:57:59.050 --> 01:57:59.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:01.250 --> 01:58:01.260 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how much is currently
 
01:58:04.189 --> 01:58:04.199 align:start position:0%
unexpended but as the Amendments is
 
01:58:04.199 --> 01:58:07.070 align:start position:0%
unexpended but as the Amendments is
written

01:58:07.070 --> 01:58:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:09.470 --> 01:58:09.480 align:start position:0%
if by the time this goes into effect the
 
01:58:11.089 --> 01:58:11.099 align:start position:0%
entire amount has been allocated it
 
01:58:12.709 --> 01:58:12.719 align:start position:0%
would require the department to dip into
 
01:58:14.330 --> 01:58:14.340 align:start position:0%
funds that have already been allocated
 
01:58:20.990 --> 01:58:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:24.609 --> 01:58:24.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:28.550 --> 01:58:28.560 align:start position:0%
this really concerns me a little bit I
 
01:58:28.560 --> 01:58:29.450 align:start position:0%
this really concerns me a little bit I
uh

01:58:29.450 --> 01:58:29.460 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:58:32.169 --> 01:58:32.179 align:start position:0%
I still you know I still sort of wonder
 
01:58:34.910 --> 01:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
I didn't feel like I ever finally got my
 
01:58:36.770 --> 01:58:36.780 align:start position:0%
questions answered
 
01:58:39.350 --> 01:58:39.360 align:start position:0%
about whether or not some at some point
 
01:58:41.089 --> 01:58:41.099 align:start position:0%
someone's going to say Arbor funds
 
01:58:42.790 --> 01:58:42.800 align:start position:0%
cannot be used
 
01:58:47.930 --> 01:58:47.940 align:start position:0%
for incarceration facilities and
 
01:58:50.209 --> 01:58:50.219 align:start position:0%
some people feel very comfortable with
 
01:58:51.950 --> 01:58:51.960 align:start position:0%
it I still feel a little bit
 
01:58:54.649 --> 01:58:54.659 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable and
 
01:58:57.050 --> 01:58:57.060 align:start position:0%
I think we had it yesterday in the bill
 
01:59:00.290 --> 01:59:00.300 align:start position:0%
we passed I think we did have a
 
01:59:02.330 --> 01:59:02.340 align:start position:0%
statement about there was a section
 
01:59:06.169 --> 01:59:06.179 align:start position:0%
about how the new facility would be
 
01:59:09.169 --> 01:59:09.179 align:start position:0%
would be funded so I'm I'm really
 
01:59:12.290 --> 01:59:12.300 align:start position:0%
worried about this and
 
01:59:14.270 --> 01:59:14.280 align:start position:0%
um going forward that we I want to make
 
01:59:16.910 --> 01:59:16.920 align:start position:0%
sure that the funds are in place so that
 
01:59:19.010 --> 01:59:19.020 align:start position:0%
we can get moving on this
 
01:59:22.250 --> 01:59:22.260 align:start position:0%
I 100 share your concern my impression
 
01:59:23.570 --> 01:59:23.580 align:start position:0%
from the meeting yesterday was that
 
01:59:25.490 --> 01:59:25.500 align:start position:0%
everybody that spoke was very clear that
 
01:59:27.109 --> 01:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General had spoken up and
 
01:59:30.109 --> 01:59:30.119 align:start position:0%
said no problem and at this point given
 
01:59:31.550 --> 01:59:31.560 align:start position:0%
that we're in the house phase not the
 
01:59:33.589 --> 01:59:33.599 align:start position:0%
Senate phase this gets us back 10
 
01:59:34.850 --> 01:59:34.860 align:start position:0%
million dollars of General funds which
 
01:59:36.530 --> 01:59:36.540 align:start position:0%
will go a long way to helping us with
 
01:59:37.729 --> 01:59:37.739 align:start position:0%
our other
 
01:59:39.530 --> 01:59:39.540 align:start position:0%
big problem we were discussing this
 
01:59:41.030 --> 01:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
morning so that's kind of the way I'm
 
01:59:44.390 --> 01:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:46.310 --> 01:59:46.320 align:start position:0%
I I will have to say I was pretty
 
01:59:48.410 --> 01:59:48.420 align:start position:0%
comfortable that we weren't going to be
 
01:59:50.629 --> 01:59:50.639 align:start position:0%
excluded based on what I heard which was
 
01:59:53.530 --> 01:59:53.540 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General
 
01:59:57.050 --> 01:59:57.060 align:start position:0%
followed the the trail on what the
 
02:00:00.950 --> 02:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
possible concern was and saw saw no
 
02:00:02.870 --> 02:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
evidence in the state of Maine that
 
02:00:06.070 --> 02:00:06.080 align:start position:0%
there's been any pushback on that I mean
 
02:00:08.689 --> 02:00:08.699 align:start position:0%
nothing's guaranteed but I I was pretty
 
02:00:10.910 --> 02:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
comfortable that we had done a
 
02:00:12.950 --> 02:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
reasonable level of due diligence on
 
02:00:15.229 --> 02:00:15.239 align:start position:0%
that one point anyway there may be other
 
02:00:17.629 --> 02:00:17.639 align:start position:0%
issues with this amendment but
 
02:00:20.149 --> 02:00:20.159 align:start position:0%
but even with that
 
02:00:20.159 --> 02:00:21.350 align:start position:0%
but even with that
um

02:00:21.350 --> 02:00:21.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:23.629 --> 02:00:23.639 align:start position:0%
I think yesterday I think we were
 
02:00:25.250 --> 02:00:25.260 align:start position:0%
thinking that we were going to have arpa
 
02:00:27.410 --> 02:00:27.420 align:start position:0%
pain for 15 million
 
02:00:32.410 --> 02:00:32.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:34.790 --> 02:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
agreed this would basically be shift in
 
02:00:34.800 --> 02:00:35.570 align:start position:0%
agreed this would basically be shift in
that

02:00:35.570 --> 02:00:35.580 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:00:37.550 --> 02:00:37.560 align:start position:0%
and as I say it just puts the burden on
 
02:00:39.550 --> 02:00:39.560 align:start position:0%
the Senate to figure out what to do
 
02:00:42.050 --> 02:00:42.060 align:start position:0%
we we have a they have an easier problem
 
02:00:43.790 --> 02:00:43.800 align:start position:0%
let's face it
 
02:00:45.470 --> 02:00:45.480 align:start position:0%
they're already doing some bills that
 
02:00:46.550 --> 02:00:46.560 align:start position:0%
probably going to impact their budget
 
02:00:47.450 --> 02:00:47.460 align:start position:0%
but plus they're also going to see
 
02:00:50.089 --> 02:00:50.099 align:start position:0%
different Revenue numbers so I this I
 
02:00:51.530 --> 02:00:51.540 align:start position:0%
think helps us with some of these other
 
02:00:52.790 --> 02:00:52.800 align:start position:0%
issues that we're going to be facing
 
02:00:52.800 --> 02:00:54.830 align:start position:0%
issues that we're going to be facing
here

02:00:54.830 --> 02:00:54.840 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:00:56.149 --> 02:00:56.159 align:start position:0%
and if we need to put on hold they'll
 
02:00:57.950 --> 02:00:57.960 align:start position:0%
put it on hold but if we can get it
 
02:01:00.050 --> 02:01:00.060 align:start position:0%
through would be nice and get one thing
 
02:01:00.060 --> 02:01:06.229 align:start position:0%
through would be nice and get one thing
done

02:01:06.229 --> 02:01:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:08.870 --> 02:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
I'd accept a straw vote if you took one
 
02:01:11.270 --> 02:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
uh representative Wilder's not here do
 
02:01:15.530 --> 02:01:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:17.209 --> 02:01:17.219 align:start position:0%
I just left division two he's there sure
 
02:02:26.629 --> 02:02:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:28.250 --> 02:02:28.260 align:start position:0%
and just you got to jump on things while
 
02:02:29.870 --> 02:02:29.880 align:start position:0%
we're waiting
 
02:02:32.330 --> 02:02:32.340 align:start position:0%
so the next
 
02:02:37.790 --> 02:02:37.800 align:start position:0%
two 89.90 and 99 I believe were what we
 
02:02:39.290 --> 02:02:39.300 align:start position:0%
discussed earlier today so I'm hopeful
 
02:02:40.430 --> 02:02:40.440 align:start position:0%
that maybe at least have the background
 
02:02:41.750 --> 02:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
for that
 
02:02:47.750 --> 02:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:50.330 --> 02:02:50.340 align:start position:0%
does he have this representative Weiler
 
02:02:51.229 --> 02:02:51.239 align:start position:0%
do you
 
02:03:00.530 --> 02:03:00.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:03.050 --> 02:03:03.060 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Wally
 
02:03:05.270 --> 02:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
so we're looking at
 
02:03:08.030 --> 02:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
number the second item which is uh
 
02:03:10.850 --> 02:03:10.860 align:start position:0%
section 77 78
 
02:03:13.370 --> 02:03:13.380 align:start position:0%
which is the 10 million dollars of
 
02:03:15.290 --> 02:03:15.300 align:start position:0%
General funds
 
02:03:16.669 --> 02:03:16.679 align:start position:0%
going toward the construction of the
 
02:03:18.830 --> 02:03:18.840 align:start position:0%
sununa center and it's been suggested
 
02:03:20.870 --> 02:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
that we take that out
 
02:03:22.669 --> 02:03:22.679 align:start position:0%
and put in this amendment which I'm
 
02:03:24.770 --> 02:03:24.780 align:start position:0%
assuming you also have does did you hand
 
02:03:27.589 --> 02:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:32.990 --> 02:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
uh it's number two 2023 1053h
 
02:03:35.629 --> 02:03:35.639 align:start position:0%
which essentially says take all the
 
02:03:38.030 --> 02:03:38.040 align:start position:0%
funding for the sununa center out of
 
02:03:40.250 --> 02:03:40.260 align:start position:0%
arpa funds
 
02:03:41.870 --> 02:03:41.880 align:start position:0%
and and we'll take it out of here for
 
02:03:43.729 --> 02:03:43.739 align:start position:0%
the 10 million of General funds we'll
 
02:03:44.930 --> 02:03:44.940 align:start position:0%
take out of here for the time being
 
02:03:46.729 --> 02:03:46.739 align:start position:0%
which will give us 10 million of General
 
02:03:49.010 --> 02:03:49.020 align:start position:0%
funds to use elsewhere and put the
 
02:03:50.450 --> 02:03:50.460 align:start position:0%
burden on the Senate if there's issues
 
02:03:53.810 --> 02:03:53.820 align:start position:0%
with the use of arpa funds so the reason
 
02:03:53.820 --> 02:03:54.530 align:start position:0%
with the use of arpa funds so the reason
um

02:03:54.530 --> 02:03:54.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:57.890 --> 02:03:57.900 align:start position:0%
my esteemed chairman who demoted me uh
 
02:03:59.570 --> 02:03:59.580 align:start position:0%
brought you in was we thought we would
 
02:04:01.370 --> 02:04:01.380 align:start position:0%
take a straw vote on that one to see
 
02:04:02.990 --> 02:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
where people stand
 
02:04:05.270 --> 02:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
so maybe just a show of hands um who
 
02:04:08.390 --> 02:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
would be in favor of removing section 77
 
02:04:16.189 --> 02:04:16.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:19.609 --> 02:04:19.619 align:start position:0%
okay and who's a and who is opposed
 
02:04:21.290 --> 02:04:21.300 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
02:04:23.990 --> 02:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
how do you want it now I have to defer
 
02:04:25.070 --> 02:04:25.080 align:start position:0%
to you Mr chair how do you want to
 
02:04:27.830 --> 02:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
handle that you
 
02:04:30.830 --> 02:04:30.840 align:start position:0%
look I I think we've done this mostly
 
02:04:32.810 --> 02:04:32.820 align:start position:0%
together two years ago we're going to
 
02:04:35.209 --> 02:04:35.219 align:start position:0%
find a lot of opportunities for us not
 
02:04:38.270 --> 02:04:38.280 align:start position:0%
to agree this may very well be one so
 
02:04:39.890 --> 02:04:39.900 align:start position:0%
the general way I think we should just
 
02:04:42.530 --> 02:04:42.540 align:start position:0%
move forward is is when we have a straw
 
02:04:45.050 --> 02:04:45.060 align:start position:0%
vote like that that we should anticipate
 
02:04:47.510 --> 02:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
that we'll end up having it become the
 
02:04:49.669 --> 02:04:49.679 align:start position:0%
division three position with the
 
02:04:52.430 --> 02:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
expectation that those in opposition
 
02:04:54.350 --> 02:04:54.360 align:start position:0%
might want to submit their own Amendment
 
02:04:56.930 --> 02:04:56.940 align:start position:0%
so I would I would close this one out
 
02:05:00.109 --> 02:05:00.119 align:start position:0%
with Mr Ripple to say we've made it a
 
02:05:03.410 --> 02:05:03.420 align:start position:0%
decision on a six to three to go ahead
 
02:05:05.689 --> 02:05:05.699 align:start position:0%
and delete
 
02:05:08.870 --> 02:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
77 and 78 I think that's what you just
 
02:05:10.850 --> 02:05:10.860 align:start position:0%
did so straw boat is going to be a vote
 
02:05:13.250 --> 02:05:13.260 align:start position:0%
is that well I so here's what I think
 
02:05:14.810 --> 02:05:14.820 align:start position:0%
we're what we're trying to get to and it
 
02:05:15.830 --> 02:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be a vote in the sense
 
02:05:18.169 --> 02:05:18.179 align:start position:0%
of being final but a really good if Mr
 
02:05:20.450 --> 02:05:20.460 align:start position:0%
Ripple can start putting together the
 
02:05:22.490 --> 02:05:22.500 align:start position:0%
that she's that that's been coming out
 
02:05:25.490 --> 02:05:25.500 align:start position:0%
from Mr Kane regarding where we stand
 
02:05:27.770 --> 02:05:27.780 align:start position:0%
and be really nice if we had an idea
 
02:05:29.750 --> 02:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
this is where we stand if we based on
 
02:05:32.030 --> 02:05:32.040 align:start position:0%
our straw votes it doesn't I think what
 
02:05:33.830 --> 02:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
Sherman was saying was we don't need to
 
02:05:35.149 --> 02:05:35.159 align:start position:0%
have it locked in and we come back on
 
02:05:36.649 --> 02:05:36.659 align:start position:0%
Monday and the vote changes we'll take
 
02:05:37.970 --> 02:05:37.980 align:start position:0%
it back out again but I'd really like to
 
02:05:42.649 --> 02:05:42.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:45.410 --> 02:05:45.420 align:start position:0%
I like it that's fine yeah I just I just
 
02:05:47.390 --> 02:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
didn't want a straw boat to be a to be a
 
02:05:50.209 --> 02:05:50.219 align:start position:0%
vote and that would change the process
 
02:05:51.709 --> 02:05:51.719 align:start position:0%
for me
 
02:05:56.270 --> 02:05:56.280 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I believe we heard from
 
02:06:01.270 --> 02:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:03.830 --> 02:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
I go over to division two and that the
 
02:06:06.709 --> 02:06:06.719 align:start position:0%
world changes um I believe the chairman
 
02:06:08.629 --> 02:06:08.639 align:start position:0%
of Finance had reached out to the
 
02:06:10.070 --> 02:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
attorney general and found that this was
 
02:06:11.570 --> 02:06:11.580 align:start position:0%
acceptable so it makes sense that we
 
02:06:16.510 --> 02:06:16.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:19.430 --> 02:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead go ahead so if I could I
 
02:06:21.229 --> 02:06:21.239 align:start position:0%
just so I just had one question on the
 
02:06:22.970 --> 02:06:22.980 align:start position:0%
voting process is your expectation then
 
02:06:24.350 --> 02:06:24.360 align:start position:0%
that you would come back and take
 
02:06:26.510 --> 02:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
another vote on each of these items in
 
02:06:29.209 --> 02:06:29.219 align:start position:0%
the future I okay to representative
 
02:06:31.729 --> 02:06:31.739 align:start position:0%
stringham's Point these are straw votes
 
02:06:33.770 --> 02:06:33.780 align:start position:0%
this this is to give you some guidance
 
02:06:36.370 --> 02:06:36.380 align:start position:0%
on how to focus your time and and and
 
02:06:38.629 --> 02:06:38.639 align:start position:0%
prioritize your thoughts we're going to
 
02:06:40.310 --> 02:06:40.320 align:start position:0%
end up coming back on Monday and taking
 
02:06:43.430 --> 02:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
all the hard votes so any of these that
 
02:06:46.310 --> 02:06:46.320 align:start position:0%
we want to revisit on Monday we can
 
02:06:49.669 --> 02:06:49.679 align:start position:0%
revisit them on Monday but
 
02:06:49.679 --> 02:06:54.890 align:start position:0%
revisit them on Monday but
yes

02:06:54.890 --> 02:06:54.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:57.890 --> 02:06:57.900 align:start position:0%
given that we've just taken a straw vote
 
02:06:59.870 --> 02:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
um is there any objection from the three
 
02:07:02.209 --> 02:07:02.219 align:start position:0%
dissenting that we make this a final
 
02:07:05.510 --> 02:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
vote now or if does do things change
 
02:07:08.450 --> 02:07:08.460 align:start position:0%
over the next 72 hours in terms of this
 
02:07:11.390 --> 02:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
are you guys willing to do the the final
 
02:07:13.729 --> 02:07:13.739 align:start position:0%
vote now let's representative
 
02:07:16.370 --> 02:07:16.380 align:start position:0%
stringham's objection he and he voted on
 
02:07:20.030 --> 02:07:20.040 align:start position:0%
the prevailing side okay so so he he he
 
02:07:22.790 --> 02:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
he is right to think that there's a
 
02:07:24.830 --> 02:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
distinction between a straw vote and a
 
02:07:27.290 --> 02:07:27.300 align:start position:0%
real vote and that he was just doing a
 
02:07:29.570 --> 02:07:29.580 align:start position:0%
straw vote
 
02:07:32.570 --> 02:07:32.580 align:start position:0%
where I was going was
 
02:07:34.790 --> 02:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
um it was does any member object to
 
02:07:41.149 --> 02:07:41.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:44.450 --> 02:07:44.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:46.629 --> 02:07:46.639 align:start position:0%
I would assume that if there were some
 
02:07:48.830 --> 02:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
incredible piece of information that
 
02:07:52.729 --> 02:07:52.739 align:start position:0%
came to us between now and Monday
 
02:07:55.669 --> 02:07:55.679 align:start position:0%
we would go back to any of these even if
 
02:07:57.410 --> 02:07:57.420 align:start position:0%
we called it a final vote
 
02:08:01.010 --> 02:08:01.020 align:start position:0%
okay so we would reconsider so I'm I'm
 
02:08:02.930 --> 02:08:02.940 align:start position:0%
okay if we take a real vote now and make
 
02:08:04.669 --> 02:08:04.679 align:start position:0%
this our position and then if there's
 
02:08:07.310 --> 02:08:07.320 align:start position:0%
new information we we then reconsider
 
02:08:09.589 --> 02:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
that vote because of new information Mr
 
02:08:11.689 --> 02:08:11.699 align:start position:0%
Stringham yeah I guess I guess you know
 
02:08:13.729 --> 02:08:13.739 align:start position:0%
I haven't caucused with the people so
 
02:08:15.709 --> 02:08:15.719 align:start position:0%
they may have objections I don't
 
02:08:18.310 --> 02:08:18.320 align:start position:0%
understand that might influence me so
 
02:08:21.229 --> 02:08:21.239 align:start position:0%
that would make me more more reluctant
 
02:08:22.910 --> 02:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
to vote in the affirmative how about
 
02:08:25.010 --> 02:08:25.020 align:start position:0%
that I haven't done that process we got
 
02:08:26.870 --> 02:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
about what five minutes
 
02:08:29.629 --> 02:08:29.639 align:start position:0%
um we'll do straw votes for through the
 
02:08:31.609 --> 02:08:31.619 align:start position:0%
next whatever a few hours obviously you
 
02:08:32.510 --> 02:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
guys have to take a break in the middle
 
02:08:32.520 --> 02:08:33.410 align:start position:0%
guys have to take a break in the middle
there

02:08:33.410 --> 02:08:33.420 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:08:34.850 --> 02:08:34.860 align:start position:0%
um but at some point we can caucus later
 
02:08:36.169 --> 02:08:36.179 align:start position:0%
in the middle of middle afternoon maybe
 
02:08:38.209 --> 02:08:38.219 align:start position:0%
or something and then come back and
 
02:08:39.530 --> 02:08:39.540 align:start position:0%
maybe do some hard votes on some of them
 
02:08:43.010 --> 02:08:43.020 align:start position:0%
with that work for everybody
 
02:08:46.070 --> 02:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
okay so continuing
 
02:08:46.080 --> 02:08:46.750 align:start position:0%
okay so continuing
um

02:08:46.750 --> 02:08:46.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:50.229 --> 02:08:50.239 align:start position:0%
sections 89 89 90 and 99
 
02:08:53.930 --> 02:08:53.940 align:start position:0%
were what we discussed this morning uh
 
02:08:57.050 --> 02:08:57.060 align:start position:0%
what Mr Bill went over with first so I
 
02:08:58.669 --> 02:08:58.679 align:start position:0%
don't know if you if you were here at Jr
 
02:09:02.030 --> 02:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
but I'll fill you in so my personally I
 
02:09:03.290 --> 02:09:03.300 align:start position:0%
would delete those
 
02:09:04.490 --> 02:09:04.500 align:start position:0%
um which is basically what the
 
02:09:06.290 --> 02:09:06.300 align:start position:0%
Amendments that Mr Ripple went over with
 
02:09:06.300 --> 02:09:07.129 align:start position:0%
Amendments that Mr Ripple went over with
us

02:09:07.129 --> 02:09:07.139 align:start position:0%
us
 
02:09:09.709 --> 02:09:09.719 align:start position:0%
um did so um thoughts on that one those
 
02:09:09.719 --> 02:09:28.790 align:start position:0%
um did so um thoughts on that one those
two

02:09:28.790 --> 02:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:33.890 --> 02:09:33.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:35.750 --> 02:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
are there any objections to deleting
 
02:09:36.770 --> 02:09:36.780 align:start position:0%
those two
 
02:09:38.390 --> 02:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
okay how about another quick straw vote
 
02:09:41.990 --> 02:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
I'll vote Yes anybody else
 
02:09:44.510 --> 02:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
okay this is unanimous can we call that
 
02:09:46.450 --> 02:09:46.460 align:start position:0%
one hard
 
02:09:54.830 --> 02:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:56.750 --> 02:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to give Mr Ripple gray hair
 
02:09:58.729 --> 02:09:58.739 align:start position:0%
by the end of today
 
02:10:01.370 --> 02:10:01.380 align:start position:0%
so if I'm not mistaken 151 is basically
 
02:10:02.510 --> 02:10:02.520 align:start position:0%
moving something to the Department of
 
02:10:05.629 --> 02:10:05.639 align:start position:0%
Safety that is sort of a non-expense I I
 
02:10:07.850 --> 02:10:07.860 align:start position:0%
support that anybody um I mean keep it
 
02:10:09.490 --> 02:10:09.500 align:start position:0%
in other words anybody opposed to that
 
02:10:12.109 --> 02:10:12.119 align:start position:0%
151 one that you had uh given to
 
02:10:13.609 --> 02:10:13.619 align:start position:0%
division two so I think they've already
 
02:10:15.950 --> 02:10:15.960 align:start position:0%
handled it so I can cross right off
 
02:10:20.649 --> 02:10:20.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:22.790 --> 02:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry
 
02:10:26.810 --> 02:10:26.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:29.149 --> 02:10:29.159 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:10:32.510 --> 02:10:32.520 align:start position:0%
my bad I apologize I hadn't deleted that
 
02:10:33.470 --> 02:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
from my list
 
02:10:36.589 --> 02:10:36.599 align:start position:0%
okay so uh where are we at 212. Choose
 
02:10:36.599 --> 02:10:38.750 align:start position:0%
okay so uh where are we at 212. Choose
Love

02:10:38.750 --> 02:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
Love
 
02:10:41.570 --> 02:10:41.580 align:start position:0%
anybody opposed to keep supposed to keep
 
02:10:42.770 --> 02:10:42.780 align:start position:0%
in that sense
 
02:10:44.689 --> 02:10:44.699 align:start position:0%
it's kind of in the noise
 
02:10:48.770 --> 02:10:48.780 align:start position:0%
I may be in the minority I I um it's not
 
02:10:52.250 --> 02:10:52.260 align:start position:0%
a lot of money uh but I really think
 
02:10:55.129 --> 02:10:55.139 align:start position:0%
that it's important for us to focus uh
 
02:10:57.290 --> 02:10:57.300 align:start position:0%
scarce resources on Direct Health Care
 
02:10:59.450 --> 02:10:59.460 align:start position:0%
as much as possible direct Health Care
 
02:11:04.990 --> 02:11:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:11.089 --> 02:11:11.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:13.870 --> 02:11:13.880 align:start position:0%
I hate to be against love
 
02:11:18.709 --> 02:11:18.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:20.720 --> 02:11:20.730 align:start position:0%
okay wait some somebody didn't vote
 
02:11:20.730 --> 02:11:33.290 align:start position:0%
okay wait some somebody didn't vote
[Laughter]

02:11:33.290 --> 02:11:33.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:35.750 --> 02:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
so it's deleted right yeah yeah yes
 
02:11:37.790 --> 02:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
barring some disaster over the weekend
 
02:11:37.800 --> 02:11:39.290 align:start position:0%
barring some disaster over the weekend
and

02:11:39.290 --> 02:11:39.300 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:11:41.629 --> 02:11:41.639 align:start position:0%
Yugoslavia or something
 
02:11:45.290 --> 02:11:45.300 align:start position:0%
so I think representative erf yes sir
 
02:11:46.970 --> 02:11:46.980 align:start position:0%
those positions are filled with
 
02:11:46.980 --> 02:11:50.890 align:start position:0%
those positions are filled with
individuals

02:11:50.890 --> 02:11:50.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:55.010 --> 02:11:55.020 align:start position:0%
sorry I was waving my hand I apologize
 
02:11:58.149 --> 02:11:58.159 align:start position:0%
and now they permanent temporary
 
02:12:01.970 --> 02:12:01.980 align:start position:0%
semi-permanent this this particular hb2
 
02:12:03.950 --> 02:12:03.960 align:start position:0%
provision this transfers those positions
 
02:12:05.750 --> 02:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
in the program from the governor's
 
02:12:07.250 --> 02:12:07.260 align:start position:0%
office to the Department of Health and
 
02:12:12.550 --> 02:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:14.570 --> 02:12:14.580 align:start position:0%
I think that meets the new information
 
02:12:17.870 --> 02:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:21.050 --> 02:12:21.060 align:start position:0%
does anybody want to change their vote
 
02:12:24.770 --> 02:12:24.780 align:start position:0%
I I really don't I I uh is given the
 
02:12:27.350 --> 02:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
enormous vacancy rates we have all over
 
02:12:30.050 --> 02:12:30.060 align:start position:0%
the state I if those folks were
 
02:12:32.089 --> 02:12:32.099 align:start position:0%
reapplied into higher productive more
 
02:12:34.189 --> 02:12:34.199 align:start position:0%
important tasks that would be okay with
 
02:12:34.199 --> 02:12:39.190 align:start position:0%
important tasks that would be okay with
me

02:12:39.190 --> 02:12:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:39.200 --> 02:12:40.990 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:12:40.990 --> 02:12:41.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:12:45.010 --> 02:12:45.020 align:start position:0%
where are they now I'm sorry
 
02:12:47.750 --> 02:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
they they are currently in the executive
 
02:12:49.669 --> 02:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
branch so they're within the governor's
 
02:12:51.229 --> 02:12:51.239 align:start position:0%
office right now they work
 
02:12:52.970 --> 02:12:52.980 align:start position:0%
collaboratively with the Department of
 
02:12:55.069 --> 02:12:55.079 align:start position:0%
uh education department of safety and
 
02:12:55.910 --> 02:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
02:12:55.920 --> 02:13:02.330 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
Services

02:13:02.330 --> 02:13:02.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:04.010 --> 02:13:04.020 align:start position:0%
so that's what I was reading was that
 
02:13:07.189 --> 02:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:08.629 --> 02:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
and I would that's what I was trying to
 
02:13:10.669 --> 02:13:10.679 align:start position:0%
wrap my brain around but it's not no
 
02:13:12.169 --> 02:13:12.179 align:start position:0%
cost is it I see a quarter million
 
02:13:15.410 --> 02:13:15.420 align:start position:0%
dollars that's the positions correct the
 
02:13:18.350 --> 02:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
the no cost component is is the
 
02:13:20.270 --> 02:13:20.280 align:start position:0%
curriculum I believe I believe that the
 
02:13:21.890 --> 02:13:21.900 align:start position:0%
curriculum itself is free typically have
 
02:13:26.990 --> 02:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:29.629 --> 02:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
if I look at this it's actually a half a
 
02:13:31.370 --> 02:13:31.380 align:start position:0%
million dollars right between the two
 
02:13:31.380 --> 02:13:33.050 align:start position:0%
million dollars right between the two
years

02:13:33.050 --> 02:13:33.060 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:13:39.890 --> 02:13:39.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:39.900 --> 02:13:41.030 align:start position:0%
 
.

02:13:41.030 --> 02:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
.
 
02:13:43.910 --> 02:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
so would you like me to re-vote
 
02:13:47.149 --> 02:13:47.159 align:start position:0%
let's have a revote who would like to
 
02:13:54.890 --> 02:13:54.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:59.990 --> 02:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:02.030 --> 02:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
six to two Okay so I think we're in the
 
02:14:02.040 --> 02:14:02.990 align:start position:0%
six to two Okay so I think we're in the
same

02:14:02.990 --> 02:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
same
 
02:14:06.169 --> 02:14:06.179 align:start position:0%
boat two opposed and
 
02:14:09.669 --> 02:14:09.679 align:start position:0%
how many do we have while or no voting
 
02:14:15.890 --> 02:14:15.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:15.900 --> 02:14:18.890 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:14:18.890 --> 02:14:18.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:18.900 --> 02:14:19.850 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:14:19.850 --> 02:14:19.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:24.290 --> 02:14:24.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:26.330 --> 02:14:26.340 align:start position:0%
so section 213 doesn't have any money
 
02:14:28.310 --> 02:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
associated with it it's the Department's
 
02:14:30.229 --> 02:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
ability to fill
 
02:14:32.330 --> 02:14:32.340 align:start position:0%
unfunded positions for the biennium
 
02:14:32.340 --> 02:14:33.770 align:start position:0%
unfunded positions for the biennium
provided

02:14:33.770 --> 02:14:33.780 align:start position:0%
provided
 
02:14:33.780 --> 02:14:34.729 align:start position:0%
provided
uh

02:14:34.729 --> 02:14:34.739 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:14:39.609 --> 02:14:39.619 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:41.629 --> 02:14:41.639 align:start position:0%
provided that the total expenditures
 
02:14:43.669 --> 02:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
don't exceed the amount appropriated for
 
02:14:43.679 --> 02:14:45.050 align:start position:0%
don't exceed the amount appropriated for
personnel

02:14:45.050 --> 02:14:45.060 align:start position:0%
personnel
 
02:14:46.430 --> 02:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
and apparently it's been in previous
 
02:14:48.830 --> 02:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
Trail bills I'm not mistaken a lot of
 
02:14:50.270 --> 02:14:50.280 align:start position:0%
them correct
 
02:14:52.669 --> 02:14:52.679 align:start position:0%
anybody opposed to leaving that one
 
02:14:52.679 --> 02:14:54.530 align:start position:0%
anybody opposed to leaving that one
there

02:14:54.530 --> 02:14:54.540 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:14:56.149 --> 02:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
okay so I'm gonna call that in oh go
 
02:14:57.050 --> 02:14:57.060 align:start position:0%
ahead sir
 
02:14:57.060 --> 02:15:00.050 align:start position:0%
ahead sir
yes

02:15:00.050 --> 02:15:00.060 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:15:02.990 --> 02:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
I believe if we're going to
 
02:15:04.729 --> 02:15:04.739 align:start position:0%
keep within our current Financial
 
02:15:07.310 --> 02:15:07.320 align:start position:0%
constraints and we're giving everybody a
 
02:15:10.850 --> 02:15:10.860 align:start position:0%
10 raise that maybe a small reduction in
 
02:15:13.970 --> 02:15:13.980 align:start position:0%
the number of unfunded positions might
 
02:15:17.569 --> 02:15:17.579 align:start position:0%
make sense so I'm not I'm okay with the
 
02:15:19.250 --> 02:15:19.260 align:start position:0%
language of filling unbunded positions
 
02:15:20.750 --> 02:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
we just might want to visit the number
 
02:15:22.310 --> 02:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
that are there
 
02:15:25.490 --> 02:15:25.500 align:start position:0%
if that makes sense representative i i i
 
02:15:29.450 --> 02:15:29.460 align:start position:0%
i I'd like to ask Mr Ripple is this one
 
02:15:33.649 --> 02:15:33.659 align:start position:0%
of the items that you identified as a
 
02:15:35.270 --> 02:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
suspension that we've done multiple
 
02:15:37.250 --> 02:15:37.260 align:start position:0%
times and that we were going to try to
 
02:15:39.709 --> 02:15:39.719 align:start position:0%
restructure it so that we just do it
 
02:15:39.719 --> 02:15:42.649 align:start position:0%
restructure it so that we just do it
permanently

02:15:42.649 --> 02:15:42.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:45.169 --> 02:15:45.179 align:start position:0%
I was not under the impression
 
02:15:47.149 --> 02:15:47.159 align:start position:0%
that there was a consensus yet that you
 
02:15:48.709 --> 02:15:48.719 align:start position:0%
would want to do this permanently but it
 
02:15:50.629 --> 02:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
is definitely an item that's been in
 
02:15:52.250 --> 02:15:52.260 align:start position:0%
previous trailer bills I think at least
 
02:15:55.729 --> 02:15:55.739 align:start position:0%
the last five so that was my my thought
 
02:15:58.310 --> 02:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
wherever we ended up on it is that I I'd
 
02:16:00.950 --> 02:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
like to just start cleaning up hb2 and
 
02:16:03.410 --> 02:16:03.420 align:start position:0%
just do this permanently so that we're
 
02:16:06.350 --> 02:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
not doing it in two years
 
02:16:06.360 --> 02:16:07.430 align:start position:0%
not doing it in two years
okay

02:16:07.430 --> 02:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:16:08.750 --> 02:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
um you can do that I can have a house
 
02:16:10.189 --> 02:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
bill two Amendment drafted I don't have
 
02:16:12.709 --> 02:16:12.719 align:start position:0%
it available now but if that was if
 
02:16:14.209 --> 02:16:14.219 align:start position:0%
that's the committee's intent now I
 
02:16:15.649 --> 02:16:15.659 align:start position:0%
think you could take that tentative vote
 
02:16:16.729 --> 02:16:16.739 align:start position:0%
and then I could have the amendment
 
02:16:16.739 --> 02:16:18.290 align:start position:0%
and then I could have the amendment
prepared

02:16:18.290 --> 02:16:18.300 align:start position:0%
prepared
 
02:16:20.270 --> 02:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
okay let's vote
 
02:16:23.450 --> 02:16:23.460 align:start position:0%
um I have a question a question go ahead
 
02:16:29.810 --> 02:16:29.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:32.870 --> 02:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
no I I asked what are we what's oh I'm
 
02:16:36.049 --> 02:16:36.059 align:start position:0%
sorry um section 213 allows DHHS to fill
 
02:16:37.790 --> 02:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
unfunded positions during the bayennium
 
02:16:40.009 --> 02:16:40.019 align:start position:0%
provided that expenditures do not exceed
 
02:16:41.450 --> 02:16:41.460 align:start position:0%
the amount appropriate for personnel
 
02:16:44.330 --> 02:16:44.340 align:start position:0%
costs and as stated it's been in a
 
02:16:45.589 --> 02:16:45.599 align:start position:0%
number of previous travel bills in fact
 
02:16:47.089 --> 02:16:47.099 align:start position:0%
I think consecutively going back for the
 
02:16:48.589 --> 02:16:48.599 align:start position:0%
last four or five at least
 
02:16:52.429 --> 02:16:52.439 align:start position:0%
so the question is to keep it so well
 
02:16:52.439 --> 02:16:53.169 align:start position:0%
so the question is to keep it so well
um

02:16:53.169 --> 02:16:53.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:55.150 --> 02:16:55.160 align:start position:0%
there's I guess there's two questions
 
02:16:58.250 --> 02:16:58.260 align:start position:0%
what chairman Edwards was proposing is
 
02:17:00.230 --> 02:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
keep it permanently
 
02:17:02.030 --> 02:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
or so there's sort of three choices keep
 
02:17:04.129 --> 02:17:04.139 align:start position:0%
it permanently keep it for the biennium
 
02:17:05.509 --> 02:17:05.519 align:start position:0%
take it out
 
02:17:07.190 --> 02:17:07.200 align:start position:0%
yes sir Mr Weller representative
 
02:17:12.950 --> 02:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:15.830 --> 02:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
some years ago we had a suggestion from
 
02:17:18.530 --> 02:17:18.540 align:start position:0%
then Governor Lynch any position that
 
02:17:23.270 --> 02:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
was empty for 18 months wasn't needed
 
02:17:25.610 --> 02:17:25.620 align:start position:0%
I think I would like to go along with
 
02:17:25.620 --> 02:17:27.770 align:start position:0%
I think I would like to go along with
that

02:17:27.770 --> 02:17:27.780 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:17:30.110 --> 02:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
well I don't disagree I don't think this
 
02:17:30.120 --> 02:17:31.509 align:start position:0%
well I don't disagree I don't think this
directly

02:17:31.509 --> 02:17:31.519 align:start position:0%
directly
 
02:17:33.889 --> 02:17:33.899 align:start position:0%
addresses that this is just if there are
 
02:17:35.389 --> 02:17:35.399 align:start position:0%
any that are unfunded they have the
 
02:17:36.830 --> 02:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
ability to move them around or is that a
 
02:17:38.330 --> 02:17:38.340 align:start position:0%
correct understanding
 
02:17:41.750 --> 02:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:45.410 --> 02:17:45.420 align:start position:0%
and I guess I'm thinking a minor tweak
 
02:17:47.990 --> 02:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
to the language which is any unfunded
 
02:17:49.669 --> 02:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
position that has been unfunded for
 
02:17:52.190 --> 02:17:52.200 align:start position:0%
right meaning temporarily vacant for the
 
02:17:54.889 --> 02:17:54.899 align:start position:0%
last 12 months they could fill but not
 
02:17:57.049 --> 02:17:57.059 align:start position:0%
necessarily all of those that have been
 
02:17:57.059 --> 02:17:58.129 align:start position:0%
necessarily all of those that have been
ongoing

02:17:58.129 --> 02:17:58.139 align:start position:0%
ongoing
 
02:17:59.450 --> 02:17:59.460 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that's something that
 
02:18:04.190 --> 02:18:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:05.990 --> 02:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
I don't understand I don't understand
 
02:18:10.129 --> 02:18:10.139 align:start position:0%
the distinction of uh 12 months
 
02:18:12.650 --> 02:18:12.660 align:start position:0%
so at some level right this the work is
 
02:18:15.410 --> 02:18:15.420 align:start position:0%
getting done already by the remaining
 
02:18:17.509 --> 02:18:17.519 align:start position:0%
staff members so there is some period of
 
02:18:17.519 --> 02:18:18.530 align:start position:0%
staff members so there is some period of
time

02:18:18.530 --> 02:18:18.540 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:18:20.750 --> 02:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
we can discuss whether that's 12 months
 
02:18:23.330 --> 02:18:23.340 align:start position:0%
18 months 10 years but at some point we
 
02:18:25.190 --> 02:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
have an unfunded position that is not
 
02:18:27.290 --> 02:18:27.300 align:start position:0%
actually doing work because it hasn't
 
02:18:29.330 --> 02:18:29.340 align:start position:0%
been filled for a very long time I don't
 
02:18:31.610 --> 02:18:31.620 align:start position:0%
know where that threshold is that we can
 
02:18:34.490 --> 02:18:34.500 align:start position:0%
debate whether it's maybe it's 24 months
 
02:18:35.810 --> 02:18:35.820 align:start position:0%
but there's some period we're carrying
 
02:18:40.009 --> 02:18:40.019 align:start position:0%
positions in right as as possible filled
 
02:18:42.110 --> 02:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
positions that have not been filled and
 
02:18:44.209 --> 02:18:44.219 align:start position:0%
the work is still being done so at some
 
02:18:46.070 --> 02:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
point we should get rid of those vacant
 
02:18:47.750 --> 02:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
positions and I think that's a
 
02:18:50.509 --> 02:18:50.519 align:start position:0%
reasonable excuse me one second I'm
 
02:18:52.969 --> 02:18:52.979 align:start position:0%
going to Chairman's privilege
 
02:18:54.889 --> 02:18:54.899 align:start position:0%
to keep the process moving since we have
 
02:18:55.969 --> 02:18:55.979 align:start position:0%
some disagreement here I'm just going to
 
02:18:56.990 --> 02:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
say when we put that I'm going to hold
 
02:18:58.490 --> 02:18:58.500 align:start position:0%
for now and we'll come back to it
 
02:19:01.669 --> 02:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
because I think it's not worth arguing
 
02:19:04.429 --> 02:19:04.439 align:start position:0%
over right now if that's acceptable
 
02:19:07.910 --> 02:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:11.570 --> 02:19:11.580 align:start position:0%
we have to yes I'm sorry
 
02:19:16.790 --> 02:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:18.650 --> 02:19:18.660 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
02:19:20.509 --> 02:19:20.519 align:start position:0%
so what time do you want to come back
 
02:19:23.810 --> 02:19:23.820 align:start position:0%
sir uh what do you what do you need
 
02:19:27.650 --> 02:19:27.660 align:start position:0%
an hour 45 minutes what do you need
 
02:19:30.709 --> 02:19:30.719 align:start position:0%
okay I I suggest we come back at ten
 
02:19:31.730 --> 02:19:31.740 align:start position:0%
after one
 
02:19:33.469 --> 02:19:33.479 align:start position:0%
so call it a lunch break
 
02:19:36.110 --> 02:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
is that reasonable okay
 
02:19:37.250 --> 02:19:37.260 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:19:41.089 --> 02:19:41.099 align:start position:0%
and and representative Hall I would
 
02:19:44.509 --> 02:19:44.519 align:start position:0%
there on this March 6 document there's a
 
02:19:45.889 --> 02:19:45.899 align:start position:0%
description of what we're trying to do
 
02:19:47.810 --> 02:19:47.820 align:start position:0%
with this unfunded thing you're you
 
02:19:50.330 --> 02:19:50.340 align:start position:0%
don't have a bad idea it's just not what
 
02:19:53.330 --> 02:19:53.340 align:start position:0%
this hb2 item's about
 
02:19:54.950 --> 02:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
I understand and maybe it has to be
 
02:19:57.469 --> 02:19:57.479 align:start position:0%
taken up separately I agree with I agree
 
02:19:59.929 --> 02:19:59.939 align:start position:0%
with the unfunded positions right it's
 
02:20:01.310 --> 02:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
more about what do we do with the
 
03:34:47.870 --> 03:34:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:51.830 --> 03:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
all right it being uh 10 minutes after
 
03:34:54.229 --> 03:34:54.239 align:start position:0%
one uh I'm gonna call division three
 
03:34:59.229 --> 03:34:59.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:03.950 --> 03:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
and we still have a few people coming in
 
03:35:06.769 --> 03:35:06.779 align:start position:0%
which is okay because it was a good
 
03:35:10.610 --> 03:35:10.620 align:start position:0%
lunch I'm sure uh we we uh we finished
 
03:35:13.370 --> 03:35:13.380 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
03:35:18.349 --> 03:35:18.359 align:start position:0%
um section 213 on the hb2 but before we
 
03:35:21.910 --> 03:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
start pile driving through hb2 again
 
03:35:25.729 --> 03:35:25.739 align:start position:0%
Vice chair Mooney has a document from
 
03:35:27.950 --> 03:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
the he she wants to discuss
 
03:35:29.990 --> 03:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so I have
 
03:35:32.570 --> 03:35:32.580 align:start position:0%
distributed to all of the division three
 
03:35:36.410 --> 03:35:36.420 align:start position:0%
members a copy of an email dated March
 
03:35:39.410 --> 03:35:39.420 align:start position:0%
14th from our attorney General John
 
03:35:41.950 --> 03:35:41.960 align:start position:0%
formella to our chairman Weiler
 
03:35:45.950 --> 03:35:45.960 align:start position:0%
discussing the use of arpa funds for the
 
03:35:49.250 --> 03:35:49.260 align:start position:0%
Youth Detention Center build now the it
 
03:35:52.309 --> 03:35:52.319 align:start position:0%
is a two-pages physical Pages three
 
03:35:56.330 --> 03:35:56.340 align:start position:0%
pages one double-sided unstapled but a
 
03:35:58.729 --> 03:35:58.739 align:start position:0%
critical summary is really in the first
 
03:36:01.849 --> 03:36:01.859 align:start position:0%
paragraph of page one saying whether
 
03:36:04.070 --> 03:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
arpa funds can be used and so forth and
 
03:36:06.469 --> 03:36:06.479 align:start position:0%
a detailed explanation is below the
 
03:36:08.990 --> 03:36:09.000 align:start position:0%
answer is they can be used for such a
 
03:36:11.870 --> 03:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
purpose so that is at everybody's place
 
03:36:13.429 --> 03:36:13.439 align:start position:0%
at this time
 
03:36:16.670 --> 03:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
no no of course that doesn't uh include
 
03:36:18.830 --> 03:36:18.840 align:start position:0%
any advice of the availability of the
 
03:36:21.050 --> 03:36:21.060 align:start position:0%
funds just the authorization to use the
 
03:36:24.050 --> 03:36:24.060 align:start position:0%
funds so so we still have um maybe an
 
03:36:26.090 --> 03:36:26.100 align:start position:0%
open question that can be uh answered
 
03:36:27.530 --> 03:36:27.540 align:start position:0%
later but
 
03:36:29.990 --> 03:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
um go ahead
 
03:36:33.530 --> 03:36:33.540 align:start position:0%
there's no question that we have not the
 
03:36:36.769 --> 03:36:36.779 align:start position:0%
state has not uh spent is the wrong word
 
03:36:38.090 --> 03:36:38.100 align:start position:0%
but and appropriately it's not the
 
03:36:39.349 --> 03:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
probably the right word either but
 
03:36:41.570 --> 03:36:41.580 align:start position:0%
there's still funds that have not been
 
03:36:43.250 --> 03:36:43.260 align:start position:0%
dedicated to what is that whatever the
 
03:36:45.469 --> 03:36:45.479 align:start position:0%
right word is allocated so we're the
 
03:36:45.479 --> 03:36:47.950 align:start position:0%
right word is allocated so we're the
legislature

03:36:47.950 --> 03:36:47.960 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
03:36:51.950 --> 03:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
so I don't disagree with you I I the
 
03:36:53.630 --> 03:36:53.640 align:start position:0%
people who are accountable for the funds
 
03:36:56.450 --> 03:36:56.460 align:start position:0%
just haven't committed to us yet that
 
03:36:58.190 --> 03:36:58.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any bearing on whether or
 
03:37:00.790 --> 03:37:00.800 align:start position:0%
not we should put it into hb2 I just
 
03:37:05.090 --> 03:37:05.100 align:start position:0%
leave it as an aspect that's not yet
 
03:37:08.150 --> 03:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
pinned down we pin down that the
 
03:37:10.130 --> 03:37:10.140 align:start position:0%
authority is there to spend this money
 
03:37:12.950 --> 03:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
on this project
 
03:37:15.650 --> 03:37:15.660 align:start position:0%
with the AGS letter
 
03:37:18.410 --> 03:37:18.420 align:start position:0%
yes sir Mr chair thank you um is it
 
03:37:21.410 --> 03:37:21.420 align:start position:0%
possible I I think representative Weiler
 
03:37:22.910 --> 03:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
or chairman Weiler forgetting this is it
 
03:37:25.790 --> 03:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
possible that we can get this over to Mr
 
03:37:27.469 --> 03:37:27.479 align:start position:0%
Ripple that a copy of this be made
 
03:37:29.269 --> 03:37:29.279 align:start position:0%
available to the General Public
 
03:37:31.190 --> 03:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
this letter
 
03:37:33.950 --> 03:37:33.960 align:start position:0%
I I don't have a problem with that a lot
 
03:37:36.530 --> 03:37:36.540 align:start position:0%
of this goes on the website anyways you
 
03:37:38.690 --> 03:37:38.700 align:start position:0%
see any reason why we wouldn't post this
 
03:37:41.269 --> 03:37:41.279 align:start position:0%
or I can put it online I don't know what
 
03:37:44.050 --> 03:37:44.060 align:start position:0%
it is I don't think I've seen it
 
03:37:48.769 --> 03:37:48.779 align:start position:0%
it's an email from Mr formella to
 
03:37:50.990 --> 03:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler with a copy to a
 
03:37:53.510 --> 03:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
few people I don't recognize and it
 
03:37:56.450 --> 03:37:56.460 align:start position:0%
essentially clarifies the authority to
 
03:38:00.610 --> 03:38:00.620 align:start position:0%
spend arpa money on this um
 
03:38:02.870 --> 03:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
replacement Center which I would
 
03:38:04.729 --> 03:38:04.739 align:start position:0%
describe as a
 
03:38:07.070 --> 03:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
an element of our
 
03:38:11.630 --> 03:38:11.640 align:start position:0%
continuity of care in uh
 
03:38:15.849 --> 03:38:15.859 align:start position:0%
trauma and the trauma informed care
 
03:38:18.229 --> 03:38:18.239 align:start position:0%
I have not read the full letter I agree
 
03:38:20.090 --> 03:38:20.100 align:start position:0%
that the first paragraph says exactly
 
03:38:22.190 --> 03:38:22.200 align:start position:0%
what representative Mooney just said and
 
03:38:23.690 --> 03:38:23.700 align:start position:0%
it's probably worthwhile at least
 
03:38:25.729 --> 03:38:25.739 align:start position:0%
documenting we spent three minutes on
 
03:38:27.410 --> 03:38:27.420 align:start position:0%
this can we move on
 
03:38:30.469 --> 03:38:30.479 align:start position:0%
thank you so
 
03:38:34.389 --> 03:38:34.399 align:start position:0%
um I I now I'm going to go backwards to
 
03:38:41.269 --> 03:38:41.279 align:start position:0%
item 2 213 DHHS ability to fill unfunded
 
03:38:41.279 --> 03:38:43.130 align:start position:0%
item 2 213 DHHS ability to fill unfunded
positions

03:38:43.130 --> 03:38:43.140 align:start position:0%
positions
 
03:38:47.929 --> 03:38:47.939 align:start position:0%
um I I think we we let this conversation
 
03:38:51.650 --> 03:38:51.660 align:start position:0%
get a little convoluted the the hb2 item
 
03:38:56.690 --> 03:38:56.700 align:start position:0%
uh is is fairly clear I think in that we
 
03:38:58.790 --> 03:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
have historically as a form of
 
03:39:01.729 --> 03:39:01.739 align:start position:0%
boilerplate allowed the department to
 
03:39:05.030 --> 03:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
fund unfunded positions to respond to
 
03:39:07.670 --> 03:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
emerging needs so that they could you
 
03:39:11.450 --> 03:39:11.460 align:start position:0%
know move uh and reallocate money the
 
03:39:14.210 --> 03:39:14.220 align:start position:0%
the the the issue here was
 
03:39:19.030 --> 03:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
one do we want to approve this hb2 item
 
03:39:23.150 --> 03:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
and if so do we want to request that it
 
03:39:24.889 --> 03:39:24.899 align:start position:0%
be made more permanent rather than
 
03:39:27.349 --> 03:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
something that we see every two years so
 
03:39:30.469 --> 03:39:30.479 align:start position:0%
let's do two questions one at a time is
 
03:39:34.610 --> 03:39:34.620 align:start position:0%
there anyone who wants to withdraw the
 
03:39:38.269 --> 03:39:38.279 align:start position:0%
historical ability of the department to
 
03:39:41.990 --> 03:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
move money around to fund unfunded
 
03:39:42.000 --> 03:39:43.130 align:start position:0%
move money around to fund unfunded
positions

03:39:43.130 --> 03:39:43.140 align:start position:0%
positions
 
03:39:49.790 --> 03:39:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:52.490 --> 03:39:52.500 align:start position:0%
I'm opposed to leaving it that way but I
 
03:39:54.349 --> 03:39:54.359 align:start position:0%
think I'm in the minority and I have no
 
03:39:56.030 --> 03:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
objection to proceeding if you guys do
 
03:39:58.130 --> 03:39:58.140 align:start position:0%
does anyone else have any opposition
 
03:39:59.809 --> 03:39:59.819 align:start position:0%
because I would like to take a straw
 
03:40:01.670 --> 03:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
poll on that
 
03:40:05.870 --> 03:40:05.880 align:start position:0%
okay so uh if you are in favor of
 
03:40:08.630 --> 03:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
retaining 213 as written please raise
 
03:40:12.170 --> 03:40:12.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:16.370 --> 03:40:16.380 align:start position:0%
one two three four five
 
03:40:19.309 --> 03:40:19.319 align:start position:0%
if you are opposed to leaving section
 
03:40:22.250 --> 03:40:22.260 align:start position:0%
213 as is please raise your hand
 
03:40:22.260 --> 03:40:23.630 align:start position:0%
213 as is please raise your hand
one

03:40:23.630 --> 03:40:23.640 align:start position:0%
one
 
03:40:26.690 --> 03:40:26.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:29.929 --> 03:40:29.939 align:start position:0%
oh okay so that's the next vote that's
 
03:40:31.969 --> 03:40:31.979 align:start position:0%
the next vote right right now this vote
 
03:40:34.910 --> 03:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
is do you want to keep this language or
 
03:40:34.920 --> 03:40:36.650 align:start position:0%
is do you want to keep this language or
not

03:40:36.650 --> 03:40:36.660 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:40:39.229 --> 03:40:39.239 align:start position:0%
or do you want to allow them
 
03:40:41.090 --> 03:40:41.100 align:start position:0%
okay but you want to make it permanent
 
03:40:44.389 --> 03:40:44.399 align:start position:0%
so so you I think are actually a yes
 
03:40:44.399 --> 03:40:45.530 align:start position:0%
so so you I think are actually a yes
okay

03:40:45.530 --> 03:40:45.540 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:40:47.990 --> 03:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
so so did you vote representative
 
03:40:48.000 --> 03:40:50.630 align:start position:0%
so so did you vote representative
nordgren

03:40:50.630 --> 03:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:54.889 --> 03:40:54.899 align:start position:0%
okay so so there we are seven one now
 
03:40:58.490 --> 03:40:58.500 align:start position:0%
the next vote is shall we ask Mr Ripple
 
03:41:00.590 --> 03:41:00.600 align:start position:0%
to convert this language to make this
 
03:41:03.290 --> 03:41:03.300 align:start position:0%
permanent Authority I'm in favor of
 
03:41:07.790 --> 03:41:07.800 align:start position:0%
doing that uh are there any questions
 
03:41:10.729 --> 03:41:10.739 align:start position:0%
comments okay raise your hand if you
 
03:41:12.590 --> 03:41:12.600 align:start position:0%
would like to see this as a permanent
 
03:41:12.600 --> 03:41:15.349 align:start position:0%
would like to see this as a permanent
Authority

03:41:15.349 --> 03:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:19.130 --> 03:41:19.140 align:start position:0%
okay who's somebody's counting I hope
 
03:41:23.269 --> 03:41:23.279 align:start position:0%
okay now opposed two so we have six to
 
03:41:26.570 --> 03:41:26.580 align:start position:0%
two so so there you have it uh Mr Ripple
 
03:41:29.090 --> 03:41:29.100 align:start position:0%
you have any questions about that I do
 
03:41:31.370 --> 03:41:31.380 align:start position:0%
not okay thank you
 
03:41:34.969 --> 03:41:34.979 align:start position:0%
um now we're on 214
 
03:41:38.090 --> 03:41:38.100 align:start position:0%
um this establishes a program where we
 
03:41:40.670 --> 03:41:40.680 align:start position:0%
reimburse senior companion and Foster
 
03:41:44.030 --> 03:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
grandparents for stipends program was
 
03:41:47.030 --> 03:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
suspended for the current biennium I
 
03:41:48.710 --> 03:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
don't recall the history is there a
 
03:41:50.510 --> 03:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
history of suspending this
 
03:41:52.309 --> 03:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
there's a history of suspending it that
 
03:41:55.370 --> 03:41:55.380 align:start position:0%
goes back to the 12 13 budget it was
 
03:41:58.070 --> 03:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
however funded in 2021 but the
 
03:42:00.769 --> 03:42:00.779 align:start position:0%
department did not expend those funds so
 
03:42:02.510 --> 03:42:02.520 align:start position:0%
it's been effectively suspended for a
 
03:42:02.520 --> 03:42:03.950 align:start position:0%
it's been effectively suspended for a
decade

03:42:03.950 --> 03:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
decade
 
03:42:03.960 --> 03:42:05.389 align:start position:0%
decade
so

03:42:05.389 --> 03:42:05.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:42:05.399 --> 03:42:06.830 align:start position:0%
so
um

03:42:06.830 --> 03:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:09.710 --> 03:42:09.720 align:start position:0%
so this is again another two-part vote
 
03:42:13.490 --> 03:42:13.500 align:start position:0%
in my in my opinion one is do you want
 
03:42:17.210 --> 03:42:17.220 align:start position:0%
to maintain hb2 as is as a concept and
 
03:42:18.769 --> 03:42:18.779 align:start position:0%
then the next second vote will be
 
03:42:19.969 --> 03:42:19.979 align:start position:0%
whether or not you want to make it
 
03:42:22.070 --> 03:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
permanent so those are two distinct
 
03:42:24.110 --> 03:42:24.120 align:start position:0%
decisions do you have a question there
 
03:42:26.690 --> 03:42:26.700 align:start position:0%
representative Wallner I just I'm just
 
03:42:28.190 --> 03:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
I'm going to
 
03:42:30.290 --> 03:42:30.300 align:start position:0%
I'm going to vote to leave it the way it
 
03:42:33.110 --> 03:42:33.120 align:start position:0%
is and the reason is because this is a
 
03:42:35.269 --> 03:42:35.279 align:start position:0%
program that
 
03:42:37.429 --> 03:42:37.439 align:start position:0%
a senator is
 
03:42:41.210 --> 03:42:41.220 align:start position:0%
very dedicated to and I think maybe the
 
03:42:43.010 --> 03:42:43.020 align:start position:0%
decision as to what to do with this
 
03:42:44.510 --> 03:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
should come in the Senate because
 
03:42:47.150 --> 03:42:47.160 align:start position:0%
there's someone there that has spent a
 
03:42:50.210 --> 03:42:50.220 align:start position:0%
lot a lot of time on this program and
 
03:42:53.210 --> 03:42:53.220 align:start position:0%
has over the years been a real advocate
 
03:42:54.410 --> 03:42:54.420 align:start position:0%
for it
 
03:42:57.650 --> 03:42:57.660 align:start position:0%
okay so I understand what you just said
 
03:42:59.210 --> 03:42:59.220 align:start position:0%
to mean that you're okay with leaving
 
03:43:01.849 --> 03:43:01.859 align:start position:0%
this hp2 item but that you don't care to
 
03:43:03.710 --> 03:43:03.720 align:start position:0%
make it permanent
 
03:43:06.590 --> 03:43:06.600 align:start position:0%
um could we see a show of hands for the
 
03:43:10.010 --> 03:43:10.020 align:start position:0%
first vote is do you want to keep H this
 
03:43:15.410 --> 03:43:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:17.990 --> 03:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
okay I've got a question go ahead what's
 
03:43:20.510 --> 03:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
your I'm confused right we have a
 
03:43:23.269 --> 03:43:23.279 align:start position:0%
program we're suspending the program so
 
03:43:25.670 --> 03:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
if we leave this in the budget or I
 
03:43:27.590 --> 03:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
assume that's suspending the continuing
 
03:43:28.790 --> 03:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
the suspension
 
03:43:31.130 --> 03:43:31.140 align:start position:0%
the program continues to be suspended
 
03:43:33.530 --> 03:43:33.540 align:start position:0%
okay the distinction is we've been doing
 
03:43:36.830 --> 03:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
this for 10 years with one term
 
03:43:39.490 --> 03:43:39.500 align:start position:0%
exception that still didn't get funded
 
03:43:42.110 --> 03:43:42.120 align:start position:0%
okay I just so if I'm voting for in
 
03:43:43.190 --> 03:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
favor of this I just want to make sure
 
03:43:45.410 --> 03:43:45.420 align:start position:0%
right we are suspending this for one
 
03:43:47.929 --> 03:43:47.939 align:start position:0%
more term this is a suspension for one
 
03:43:51.349 --> 03:43:51.359 align:start position:0%
more term yes and I'm a yes okay so so
 
03:43:53.809 --> 03:43:53.819 align:start position:0%
again the straw vote if you're in favor
 
03:43:56.750 --> 03:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
of maintaining this hp2 line item please
 
03:43:58.990 --> 03:43:59.000 align:start position:0%
raise your hand
 
03:44:01.550 --> 03:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
okay I see Stringham behind me that's
 
03:44:03.889 --> 03:44:03.899 align:start position:0%
unanimous eight nothing right
 
03:44:07.309 --> 03:44:07.319 align:start position:0%
okay for completion then let's go ahead
 
03:44:09.889 --> 03:44:09.899 align:start position:0%
and do the other one which is how many
 
03:44:13.309 --> 03:44:13.319 align:start position:0%
of you would make this permanent as
 
03:44:16.670 --> 03:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
opposed to two years raise your hand one
 
03:44:19.250 --> 03:44:19.260 align:start position:0%
two three four
 
03:44:19.260 --> 03:44:21.290 align:start position:0%
two three four
okay

03:44:21.290 --> 03:44:21.300 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:44:23.990 --> 03:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
okay so the next vote is how many are
 
03:44:25.910 --> 03:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
you opposed to making this Tournament of
 
03:44:30.229 --> 03:44:30.239 align:start position:0%
the permanent one two three represent an
 
03:44:33.830 --> 03:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
organ four so it'd be in tide there is
 
03:44:38.150 --> 03:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
no vote so we'll continue it as is and I
 
03:44:39.769 --> 03:44:39.779 align:start position:0%
I don't care to talk about this on
 
03:44:42.469 --> 03:44:42.479 align:start position:0%
Monday again unless we have to
 
03:44:44.750 --> 03:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
03:44:44.760 --> 03:44:45.490 align:start position:0%
okay so
um

03:44:45.490 --> 03:44:45.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:47.929 --> 03:44:47.939 align:start position:0%
congregate housing and services
 
03:44:52.210 --> 03:44:52.220 align:start position:0%
suspension is item 215
 
03:44:55.670 --> 03:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
Mr Ripple can you talk about that
 
03:44:57.590 --> 03:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
this is another one that's been
 
03:44:59.269 --> 03:44:59.279 align:start position:0%
suspended in every budget since 12 13
 
03:45:01.849 --> 03:45:01.859 align:start position:0%
with the exception of 2021 and again the
 
03:45:03.469 --> 03:45:03.479 align:start position:0%
department did not expend those funds in
 
03:45:03.479 --> 03:45:06.170 align:start position:0%
department did not expend those funds in
2021.

03:45:06.170 --> 03:45:06.180 align:start position:0%
2021.
 
03:45:09.530 --> 03:45:09.540 align:start position:0%
is there any discussion on that
 
03:45:11.870 --> 03:45:11.880 align:start position:0%
because you see the pattern we're going
 
03:45:15.410 --> 03:45:15.420 align:start position:0%
to vote to see if you accept the hb2
 
03:45:17.830 --> 03:45:17.840 align:start position:0%
line item as is
 
03:45:21.229 --> 03:45:21.239 align:start position:0%
okay so straw vote
 
03:45:23.690 --> 03:45:23.700 align:start position:0%
um on 215
 
03:45:26.510 --> 03:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
do you want to accept this hb2 line item
 
03:45:30.769 --> 03:45:30.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:33.110 --> 03:45:33.120 align:start position:0%
okay that looks unanimous to me eight to
 
03:45:33.120 --> 03:45:35.990 align:start position:0%
okay that looks unanimous to me eight to
nothing

03:45:35.990 --> 03:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:40.269 --> 03:45:40.279 align:start position:0%
okay so now we're on 216 Cola increases
 
03:45:43.429 --> 03:45:43.439 align:start position:0%
I think that's cost of living allowances
 
03:45:47.210 --> 03:45:47.220 align:start position:0%
not soda increases for elderly and adult
 
03:45:50.570 --> 03:45:50.580 align:start position:0%
clients under the social services block
 
03:45:50.580 --> 03:45:53.090 align:start position:0%
clients under the social services block
grant

03:45:53.090 --> 03:45:53.100 align:start position:0%
grant
 
03:45:54.830 --> 03:45:54.840 align:start position:0%
do you want to talk to us about this
 
03:46:00.050 --> 03:46:00.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:01.910 --> 03:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
it is it's boilerplate that the
 
03:46:03.349 --> 03:46:03.359 align:start position:0%
department has had going back quite a
 
03:46:04.969 --> 03:46:04.979 align:start position:0%
while there was only one budget I think
 
03:46:06.710 --> 03:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
in the last decade in which it was not
 
03:46:06.720 --> 03:46:08.389 align:start position:0%
in the last decade in which it was not
included

03:46:08.389 --> 03:46:08.399 align:start position:0%
included
 
03:46:08.399 --> 03:46:12.710 align:start position:0%
included
um

03:46:12.710 --> 03:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:14.690 --> 03:46:14.700 align:start position:0%
and that's that's really all I have on
 
03:46:16.070 --> 03:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
that I don't know if Nathan's able to
 
03:46:21.290 --> 03:46:21.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:23.510 --> 03:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
on the actual um
 
03:46:26.090 --> 03:46:26.100 align:start position:0%
cost of living adjustments
 
03:46:29.150 --> 03:46:29.160 align:start position:0%
the the the cost is is generally de
 
03:46:30.710 --> 03:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
minimis and absorbed within our budget
 
03:46:33.830 --> 03:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:36.830 --> 03:46:36.840 align:start position:0%
so effectively this is no budgetary
 
03:46:38.870 --> 03:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
impact that the fiscal committee can
 
03:46:41.210 --> 03:46:41.220 align:start position:0%
even finance committee can even see
 
03:46:44.170 --> 03:46:44.180 align:start position:0%
right correct okay
 
03:46:48.229 --> 03:46:48.239 align:start position:0%
so is there anyone opposed to this hp2
 
03:46:49.849 --> 03:46:49.859 align:start position:0%
line item
 
03:46:51.349 --> 03:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
this is your time to say so
 
03:46:55.910 --> 03:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:57.950 --> 03:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
no no you don't want to discuss it
 
03:47:00.250 --> 03:47:00.260 align:start position:0%
you're just in the minority okay
 
03:47:03.650 --> 03:47:03.660 align:start position:0%
representative erf does not like this
 
03:47:06.469 --> 03:47:06.479 align:start position:0%
um okay so uh we're going to do a straw
 
03:47:09.530 --> 03:47:09.540 align:start position:0%
vote do we retain
 
03:47:12.889 --> 03:47:12.899 align:start position:0%
to section 216 as written raise your
 
03:47:16.670 --> 03:47:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:19.910 --> 03:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
now raise your hand if you're opposed so
 
03:47:25.630 --> 03:47:25.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:29.030 --> 03:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
okay now we're on to two seven Mr chair
 
03:47:31.550 --> 03:47:31.560 align:start position:0%
go ahead I'm reserving the right after I
 
03:47:34.190 --> 03:47:34.200 align:start position:0%
read that section completely to vote on
 
03:47:37.130 --> 03:47:37.140 align:start position:0%
it one day if we can I I I don't think
 
03:47:39.710 --> 03:47:39.720 align:start position:0%
we have to say that every time uh I I
 
03:47:41.750 --> 03:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
think on Monday we're going to have an
 
03:47:43.309 --> 03:47:43.319 align:start position:0%
idea of what we really want to talk
 
03:47:45.950 --> 03:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
about the controversial stuff but if
 
03:47:47.990 --> 03:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
anyone has anything that we've already
 
03:47:50.389 --> 03:47:50.399 align:start position:0%
agreed on that we want to come back and
 
03:47:53.590 --> 03:47:53.600 align:start position:0%
revisit everything is open for
 
03:47:57.469 --> 03:47:57.479 align:start position:0%
reconsideration on Monday just based on
 
03:48:02.870 --> 03:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
any members uh discretion okay
 
03:48:04.429 --> 03:48:04.439 align:start position:0%
yes are we going to be moving anything
 
03:48:05.630 --> 03:48:05.640 align:start position:0%
along today
 
03:48:08.269 --> 03:48:08.279 align:start position:0%
I think we are okay great you know every
 
03:48:10.670 --> 03:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
everything that we're telling uh Mr
 
03:48:12.889 --> 03:48:12.899 align:start position:0%
Ripple is okay he's going to be
 
03:48:15.410 --> 03:48:15.420 align:start position:0%
anticipating it's okay until we come
 
03:48:18.170 --> 03:48:18.180 align:start position:0%
back on Monday and change our minds
 
03:48:20.510 --> 03:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm hoping we're not changing our
 
03:48:22.370 --> 03:48:22.380 align:start position:0%
minds but you never know right so you'll
 
03:48:23.450 --> 03:48:23.460 align:start position:0%
get a new sheet and I'll record
 
03:48:24.650 --> 03:48:24.660 align:start position:0%
everything you've done today as
 
03:48:26.809 --> 03:48:26.819 align:start position:0%
tentative votes and I'll operate on the
 
03:48:27.889 --> 03:48:27.899 align:start position:0%
assumption that they're going to be
 
03:48:30.349 --> 03:48:30.359 align:start position:0%
final unless a member wants to take them
 
03:48:32.090 --> 03:48:32.100 align:start position:0%
back up a second time
 
03:48:33.800 --> 03:48:33.810 align:start position:0%
is that okay
 
03:48:33.810 --> 03:48:33.830 align:start position:0%
is that okay
[Music]

03:48:33.830 --> 03:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:48:33.840 --> 03:48:35.570 align:start position:0%
[Music]
okay

03:48:35.570 --> 03:48:35.580 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:48:37.670 --> 03:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:48:40.490 --> 03:48:40.500 align:start position:0%
so there we are 217.
 
03:48:43.190 --> 03:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
delay of the perspective repeal and
 
03:48:46.370 --> 03:48:46.380 align:start position:0%
reenactment of RSA 135 and change
 
03:48:50.210 --> 03:48:50.220 align:start position:0%
relative to access to the states Mental
 
03:48:53.210 --> 03:48:53.220 align:start position:0%
Health Services System
 
03:48:55.370 --> 03:48:55.380 align:start position:0%
do you want to say something about this
 
03:48:58.490 --> 03:48:58.500 align:start position:0%
Mr Ripple sure so this is a budget
 
03:49:00.290 --> 03:49:00.300 align:start position:0%
savings measure that again has been in
 
03:49:03.469 --> 03:49:03.479 align:start position:0%
place since around 2012 2013.
 
03:49:06.229 --> 03:49:06.239 align:start position:0%
um and it would replace one statute with
 
03:49:07.790 --> 03:49:07.800 align:start position:0%
another so I'll read you the relevant
 
03:49:10.729 --> 03:49:10.739 align:start position:0%
provision that's in statute now
 
03:49:11.750 --> 03:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
um there
 
03:49:14.630 --> 03:49:14.640 align:start position:0%
before you do that just just what is the
 
03:49:16.429 --> 03:49:16.439 align:start position:0%
impact if we do this what what what
 
03:49:19.550 --> 03:49:19.560 align:start position:0%
difference does it make
 
03:49:22.010 --> 03:49:22.020 align:start position:0%
if you leave it as is there's no
 
03:49:24.410 --> 03:49:24.420 align:start position:0%
budgetary impact if you take it out
 
03:49:26.090 --> 03:49:26.100 align:start position:0%
there's potentially potentially a
 
03:49:27.769 --> 03:49:27.779 align:start position:0%
budgetary impact because then the
 
03:49:29.030 --> 03:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
state's 10 Community Mental Health
 
03:49:31.070 --> 03:49:31.080 align:start position:0%
Centers would be required to treat
 
03:49:31.080 --> 03:49:33.229 align:start position:0%
Centers would be required to treat
everyone

03:49:33.229 --> 03:49:33.239 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
03:49:35.450 --> 03:49:35.460 align:start position:0%
um without
 
03:49:37.849 --> 03:49:37.859 align:start position:0%
triaging the severity of their their
 
03:49:39.530 --> 03:49:39.540 align:start position:0%
their issues
 
03:49:41.570 --> 03:49:41.580 align:start position:0%
okay and then you can read the two
 
03:49:44.330 --> 03:49:44.340 align:start position:0%
District differences if you care to I I
 
03:49:47.210 --> 03:49:47.220 align:start position:0%
just like knowing kind of top down where
 
03:49:50.690 --> 03:49:50.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:52.490 --> 03:49:52.500 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:49:55.070 --> 03:49:55.080 align:start position:0%
the the relevant sentence in statute is
 
03:49:56.269 --> 03:49:56.279 align:start position:0%
admission to the State Mental Health
 
03:49:58.250 --> 03:49:58.260 align:start position:0%
Services System and access to treatments
 
03:49:59.690 --> 03:49:59.700 align:start position:0%
and other services within the system
 
03:50:01.550 --> 03:50:01.560 align:start position:0%
shall be contingent upon the
 
03:50:03.950 --> 03:50:03.960 align:start position:0%
availability of Appropriations the
 
03:50:04.910 --> 03:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
community mental health program
 
03:50:07.010 --> 03:50:07.020 align:start position:0%
responsible for providing Services shall
 
03:50:08.809 --> 03:50:08.819 align:start position:0%
conduct a clinical assessment of every
 
03:50:10.550 --> 03:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
applicant for services
 
03:50:12.349 --> 03:50:12.359 align:start position:0%
and the community mental health program
 
03:50:14.210 --> 03:50:14.220 align:start position:0%
shall prioritize delivery of services
 
03:50:15.769 --> 03:50:15.779 align:start position:0%
based on the severity of the
 
03:50:17.809 --> 03:50:17.819 align:start position:0%
individual's clinical needs so that's
 
03:50:20.929 --> 03:50:20.939 align:start position:0%
the budget saving provision right there
 
03:50:26.150 --> 03:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
so if you leave section 217 as is that
 
03:50:27.950 --> 03:50:27.960 align:start position:0%
language will continue for another two
 
03:50:30.590 --> 03:50:30.600 align:start position:0%
years if you take Section 217 out that
 
03:50:32.389 --> 03:50:32.399 align:start position:0%
language will be gone and the Community
 
03:50:33.889 --> 03:50:33.899 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Centers will have to treat
 
03:50:33.899 --> 03:50:36.190 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Centers will have to treat
everyone

03:50:36.190 --> 03:50:36.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:40.610 --> 03:50:40.620 align:start position:0%
okay any questions about that you've
 
03:50:42.950 --> 03:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
seen this before so do you have any
 
03:50:47.630 --> 03:50:47.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:49.550 --> 03:50:49.560 align:start position:0%
Mike wasn't on but I think he said it
 
03:50:52.309 --> 03:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
was important to leave it in yeah okay
 
03:50:56.809 --> 03:50:56.819 align:start position:0%
is there any opposition to this section
 
03:50:59.330 --> 03:50:59.340 align:start position:0%
I'm not seeing any so quick show of
 
03:51:01.130 --> 03:51:01.140 align:start position:0%
hands if you're in favor
 
03:51:03.650 --> 03:51:03.660 align:start position:0%
okay unanimous I think representative
 
03:51:03.660 --> 03:51:04.790 align:start position:0%
okay unanimous I think representative
nordgren

03:51:04.790 --> 03:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
nordgren
 
03:51:04.800 --> 03:51:05.830 align:start position:0%
nordgren
yeah

03:51:05.830 --> 03:51:05.840 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:51:09.429 --> 03:51:09.439 align:start position:0%
and then the next question is
 
03:51:12.110 --> 03:51:12.120 align:start position:0%
do we want to do this every two years or
 
03:51:14.090 --> 03:51:14.100 align:start position:0%
do we want to try to convert this to a
 
03:51:14.100 --> 03:51:15.050 align:start position:0%
do we want to try to convert this to a
permanent

03:51:15.050 --> 03:51:15.060 align:start position:0%
permanent
 
03:51:18.650 --> 03:51:18.660 align:start position:0%
do you have a thought on that Mr Ripple
 
03:51:21.349 --> 03:51:21.359 align:start position:0%
uh my only thought is that you might
 
03:51:22.910 --> 03:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
compared to some of the other sections
 
03:51:24.110 --> 03:51:24.120 align:start position:0%
that are in here you might you might
 
03:51:25.610 --> 03:51:25.620 align:start position:0%
hear from some Advocates if you made
 
03:51:27.590 --> 03:51:27.600 align:start position:0%
this permanent
 
03:51:29.750 --> 03:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
okay so that's a great financial
 
03:51:32.530 --> 03:51:32.540 align:start position:0%
analysis I just heard
 
03:51:36.769 --> 03:51:36.779 align:start position:0%
thank you from the O for the LBA so
 
03:51:40.849 --> 03:51:40.859 align:start position:0%
um okay so does anyone want to I'm going
 
03:51:42.469 --> 03:51:42.479 align:start position:0%
to ask you a show of hands if you want
 
03:51:44.030 --> 03:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
to try to convert this to being
 
03:51:45.889 --> 03:51:45.899 align:start position:0%
permanent instead of every two years
 
03:51:48.590 --> 03:51:48.600 align:start position:0%
raise your hands if you're in favor of
 
03:51:48.600 --> 03:51:51.229 align:start position:0%
raise your hands if you're in favor of
permanency

03:51:51.229 --> 03:51:51.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:52.969 --> 03:51:52.979 align:start position:0%
I see one
 
03:51:56.330 --> 03:51:56.340 align:start position:0%
okay uh are there those that would be
 
03:52:00.590 --> 03:52:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:03.469 --> 03:52:03.479 align:start position:0%
are you abstaining you know I got we
 
03:52:06.530 --> 03:52:06.540 align:start position:0%
have a serious I don't care but so this
 
03:52:11.450 --> 03:52:11.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:13.610 --> 03:52:13.620 align:start position:0%
you I can't hear you because I'm deaf
 
03:52:21.349 --> 03:52:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:21.359 --> 03:52:27.050 align:start position:0%
 
it

03:52:27.050 --> 03:52:27.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:27.060 --> 03:52:28.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:52:28.510 --> 03:52:28.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:52:31.250 --> 03:52:31.260 align:start position:0%
oh I get it that's funny
 
03:52:33.950 --> 03:52:33.960 align:start position:0%
it's it's only 1 30 and we already don't
 
03:52:37.490 --> 03:52:37.500 align:start position:0%
care this is this is so good thank you
 
03:52:39.889 --> 03:52:39.899 align:start position:0%
thank you so much all right a little
 
03:52:41.750 --> 03:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
slow on the uptake
 
03:52:41.760 --> 03:52:42.650 align:start position:0%
slow on the uptake
um

03:52:42.650 --> 03:52:42.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:45.229 --> 03:52:45.239 align:start position:0%
okay this is why you have a vice chair
 
03:52:48.550 --> 03:52:48.560 align:start position:0%
that can still hear Jeremy needs coffee
 
03:52:50.809 --> 03:52:50.819 align:start position:0%
do you have something
 
03:52:53.469 --> 03:52:53.479 align:start position:0%
okay I said chairman needs coffee
 
03:52:57.469 --> 03:52:57.479 align:start position:0%
so so uh 218 direct and indirect
 
03:52:59.349 --> 03:52:59.359 align:start position:0%
graduate medical
 
03:53:03.410 --> 03:53:03.420 align:start position:0%
education suspension I I even remember
 
03:53:06.170 --> 03:53:06.180 align:start position:0%
this one so uh what do you want to say
 
03:53:08.389 --> 03:53:08.399 align:start position:0%
about this uh Mr Ripple
 
03:53:10.190 --> 03:53:10.200 align:start position:0%
uh this is another with my standard
 
03:53:11.690 --> 03:53:11.700 align:start position:0%
comment that it's been suspended
 
03:53:14.269 --> 03:53:14.279 align:start position:0%
regularly since 12 13.
 
03:53:16.370 --> 03:53:16.380 align:start position:0%
and there can't be much of an advocacy
 
03:53:19.429 --> 03:53:19.439 align:start position:0%
group for this by now so this could
 
03:53:22.790 --> 03:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
possibly be a permanent thing so so
 
03:53:25.309 --> 03:53:25.319 align:start position:0%
let's do it in two votes how many of you
 
03:53:28.790 --> 03:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
would like to retain 218 as written
 
03:53:31.790 --> 03:53:31.800 align:start position:0%
please raise your hand
 
03:53:35.030 --> 03:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
okay representative nordgren are you is
 
03:53:38.450 --> 03:53:38.460 align:start position:0%
that a hand raise or not no okay so all
 
03:53:40.729 --> 03:53:40.739 align:start position:0%
those opposed raise your hand so we got
 
03:53:44.030 --> 03:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
a one so that's a seven to one to keep
 
03:53:46.370 --> 03:53:46.380 align:start position:0%
the language as is do you do you want to
 
03:53:48.110 --> 03:53:48.120 align:start position:0%
say why representative Northern while
 
03:53:52.729 --> 03:53:52.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:55.670 --> 03:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
yeah I think there was a reason we
 
03:53:59.090 --> 03:53:59.100 align:start position:0%
started doing this and it really was in
 
03:54:01.990 --> 03:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
particular to encourage New Hampshire
 
03:54:05.210 --> 03:54:05.220 align:start position:0%
students to be enrolled in the medical
 
03:54:08.150 --> 03:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
school and this was like helping with
 
03:54:10.130 --> 03:54:10.140 align:start position:0%
their tuition so
 
03:54:10.140 --> 03:54:12.170 align:start position:0%
their tuition so
foreign

03:54:12.170 --> 03:54:12.180 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
03:54:14.750 --> 03:54:14.760 align:start position:0%
yeah so I still would be committed to
 
03:54:17.150 --> 03:54:17.160 align:start position:0%
that okay
 
03:54:21.469 --> 03:54:21.479 align:start position:0%
um thank you uh so we have a strong vote
 
03:54:22.790 --> 03:54:22.800 align:start position:0%
to retain
 
03:54:24.410 --> 03:54:24.420 align:start position:0%
um and you guys can talk about that over
 
03:54:25.910 --> 03:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
the weekend but
 
03:54:29.269 --> 03:54:29.279 align:start position:0%
um so next uh I'd like to see if anyone
 
03:54:31.490 --> 03:54:31.500 align:start position:0%
wants to make it permanent I I would
 
03:54:33.950 --> 03:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
like to do as much to clean up hb2 as
 
03:54:35.630 --> 03:54:35.640 align:start position:0%
possible so I'm going to vote Yes to
 
03:54:37.510 --> 03:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
make it permanent
 
03:54:39.650 --> 03:54:39.660 align:start position:0%
show hands if you want to make it
 
03:54:44.030 --> 03:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
permanent one two three four uh those
 
03:54:46.370 --> 03:54:46.380 align:start position:0%
opposed to making it permanent
 
03:54:49.070 --> 03:54:49.080 align:start position:0%
I assume you're opposed okay so that
 
03:54:51.170 --> 03:54:51.180 align:start position:0%
that does not carry so we're going to do
 
03:54:53.450 --> 03:54:53.460 align:start position:0%
this on a
 
03:54:53.460 --> 03:54:54.710 align:start position:0%
this on a
um

03:54:54.710 --> 03:54:54.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:55:00.170 --> 03:55:00.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:01.990 --> 03:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
item 219
 
03:55:06.290 --> 03:55:06.300 align:start position:0%
catastrophic Aid to hospitals suspension
 
03:55:09.769 --> 03:55:09.779 align:start position:0%
Miss Ripple again suspended regularly
 
03:55:12.050 --> 03:55:12.060 align:start position:0%
since the 1213 biennium
 
03:55:16.729 --> 03:55:16.739 align:start position:0%
so just comment on on on what this does
 
03:55:18.830 --> 03:55:18.840 align:start position:0%
um uh because it is related to other
 
03:55:20.830 --> 03:55:20.840 align:start position:0%
things that we've been talking about and
 
03:55:23.570 --> 03:55:23.580 align:start position:0%
catastrophic Aid let's say somebody gets
 
03:55:25.610 --> 03:55:25.620 align:start position:0%
stuck in the hospital for 150 days and
 
03:55:28.790 --> 03:55:28.800 align:start position:0%
they get a 200 000 payment and the
 
03:55:31.189 --> 03:55:31.199 align:start position:0%
Medicaid drg payment is eight thousand
 
03:55:33.530 --> 03:55:33.540 align:start position:0%
dollars at some point
 
03:55:35.630 --> 03:55:35.640 align:start position:0%
um catastrophic claims support kicks
 
03:55:37.670 --> 03:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
into the hospital
 
03:55:39.830 --> 03:55:39.840 align:start position:0%
um you know doesn't end up paying for
 
03:55:43.189 --> 03:55:43.199 align:start position:0%
for that that patient 100 on their own
 
03:55:45.349 --> 03:55:45.359 align:start position:0%
there's a kick in from the state and
 
03:55:46.910 --> 03:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
obviously they haven't been doing that
 
03:55:48.969 --> 03:55:48.979 align:start position:0%
and the hospital
 
03:55:53.090 --> 03:55:53.100 align:start position:0%
Association uh did say that uh that that
 
03:55:54.830 --> 03:55:54.840 align:start position:0%
it had been taken out of the budget many
 
03:55:56.990 --> 03:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
times and they didn't specifically ask
 
03:55:59.750 --> 03:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
it to be put back in but
 
03:56:01.250 --> 03:56:01.260 align:start position:0%
um I think it is
 
03:56:01.260 --> 03:56:01.870 align:start position:0%
um I think it is
um

03:56:01.870 --> 03:56:01.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:56:05.450 --> 03:56:05.460 align:start position:0%
uh you know a good idea to
 
03:56:07.130 --> 03:56:07.140 align:start position:0%
um keep it in in the long run and not
 
03:56:09.710 --> 03:56:09.720 align:start position:0%
make it a permanent cut so even if we
 
03:56:11.750 --> 03:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
take it take out catastrophic payments
 
03:56:14.990 --> 03:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:20.809 --> 03:56:20.819 align:start position:0%
okay so that sets up uh two votes uh on
 
03:56:23.630 --> 03:56:23.640 align:start position:0%
219 first to keep the language as is for
 
03:56:26.150 --> 03:56:26.160 align:start position:0%
the biennium uh those in favor raise
 
03:56:28.929 --> 03:56:28.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:31.250 --> 03:56:31.260 align:start position:0%
representative norgren okay that's
 
03:56:33.469 --> 03:56:33.479 align:start position:0%
unanimous those that would make it
 
03:56:36.830 --> 03:56:36.840 align:start position:0%
permanent raise your hand
 
03:56:38.809 --> 03:56:38.819 align:start position:0%
okay four
 
03:56:41.689 --> 03:56:41.699 align:start position:0%
those that would oppose making it
 
03:56:43.429 --> 03:56:43.439 align:start position:0%
permanent raise your hand
 
03:56:46.550 --> 03:56:46.560 align:start position:0%
represent an organ okay so the that does
 
03:56:58.870 --> 03:56:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:02.570 --> 03:57:02.580 align:start position:0%
okay so we're on
 
03:57:07.189 --> 03:57:07.199 align:start position:0%
220. do you want to talk to us about 220
 
03:57:07.199 --> 03:57:09.290 align:start position:0%
220. do you want to talk to us about 220
sure

03:57:09.290 --> 03:57:09.300 align:start position:0%
sure
 
03:57:11.630 --> 03:57:11.640 align:start position:0%
so section 220 states that in the event
 
03:57:13.490 --> 03:57:13.500 align:start position:0%
that Appropriations in the Medicaid to
 
03:57:15.290 --> 03:57:15.300 align:start position:0%
schools accounting unit are insufficient
 
03:57:16.849 --> 03:57:16.859 align:start position:0%
the department may come to fiscal to
 
03:57:18.229 --> 03:57:18.239 align:start position:0%
accept and expend additional federal
 
03:57:21.050 --> 03:57:21.060 align:start position:0%
funds and that any such requests include
 
03:57:22.790 --> 03:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
a detailed explanation of the types of
 
03:57:24.469 --> 03:57:24.479 align:start position:0%
assistance the department is providing
 
03:57:28.330 --> 03:57:28.340 align:start position:0%
to local school districts to help them
 
03:57:31.610 --> 03:57:31.620 align:start position:0%
ensure eligibility for reimbursement so
 
03:57:33.769 --> 03:57:33.779 align:start position:0%
this was an issue two years ago I
 
03:57:34.910 --> 03:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
believe there were some stories in the
 
03:57:36.349 --> 03:57:36.359 align:start position:0%
news in which school districts were
 
03:57:37.910 --> 03:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
providing services but were not
 
03:57:40.370 --> 03:57:40.380 align:start position:0%
receiving reimbursement and so this
 
03:57:42.410 --> 03:57:42.420 align:start position:0%
section was added to house bill 2. so it
 
03:57:44.689 --> 03:57:44.699 align:start position:0%
was first in-house Bill to
 
03:57:48.229 --> 03:57:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:50.570 --> 03:57:50.580 align:start position:0%
Mr Roy do you have any comments about
 
03:57:54.110 --> 03:57:54.120 align:start position:0%
the current perception of the potential
 
03:57:56.750 --> 03:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
demand for this
 
03:57:59.630 --> 03:57:59.640 align:start position:0%
so I I think this is an area that that
 
03:58:02.090 --> 03:58:02.100 align:start position:0%
as Kevin pointed out it has been uh
 
03:58:04.070 --> 03:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
difficult to predict because it is based
 
03:58:06.410 --> 03:58:06.420 align:start position:0%
on whether a school chooses to
 
03:58:09.110 --> 03:58:09.120 align:start position:0%
participate in the program we've
 
03:58:11.389 --> 03:58:11.399 align:start position:0%
budgeted approximately 17 million
 
03:58:14.150 --> 03:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
dollars each year in 2022 the actual was
 
03:58:14.160 --> 03:58:16.790 align:start position:0%
dollars each year in 2022 the actual was
14.38

03:58:16.790 --> 03:58:16.800 align:start position:0%
14.38
 
03:58:18.889 --> 03:58:18.899 align:start position:0%
um as this shows up in the in the state
 
03:58:21.769 --> 03:58:21.779 align:start position:0%
budget this this shows up as a hundred
 
03:58:24.170 --> 03:58:24.180 align:start position:0%
percent federal funds so this would be
 
03:58:25.670 --> 03:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
the additional acceptance of federal
 
03:58:25.680 --> 03:58:27.590 align:start position:0%
the additional acceptance of federal
dollars

03:58:27.590 --> 03:58:27.600 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:58:31.729 --> 03:58:31.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:35.330 --> 03:58:35.340 align:start position:0%
okay to summarize the things I just
 
03:58:37.910 --> 03:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
heard is there's no State money this is
 
03:58:40.070 --> 03:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
all federal if we keep the language as
 
03:58:43.729 --> 03:58:43.739 align:start position:0%
is correct all right not not to be a
 
03:58:47.090 --> 03:58:47.100 align:start position:0%
mercenary but uh all right so are there
 
03:58:49.370 --> 03:58:49.380 align:start position:0%
any conversations or discussions about
 
03:58:52.010 --> 03:58:52.020 align:start position:0%
this anyone opposed to maintaining this
 
03:58:52.020 --> 03:58:54.170 align:start position:0%
this anyone opposed to maintaining this
language

03:58:54.170 --> 03:58:54.180 align:start position:0%
language
 
03:58:56.870 --> 03:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh seeing then let's do a straw vote if
 
03:58:58.130 --> 03:58:58.140 align:start position:0%
you're in favor of maintaining this
 
03:59:00.790 --> 03:59:00.800 align:start position:0%
language raise your hand
 
03:59:03.769 --> 03:59:03.779 align:start position:0%
okay that's unanimous
 
03:59:05.990 --> 03:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
um is this subject a subject for a good
 
03:59:07.849 --> 03:59:07.859 align:start position:0%
subject for making it permanent it
 
03:59:09.349 --> 03:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't feel like it if it's it's only
 
03:59:10.849 --> 03:59:10.859 align:start position:0%
been around once
 
03:59:14.929 --> 03:59:14.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:16.309 --> 03:59:16.319 align:start position:0%
um I have no thoughts but as you
 
03:59:18.170 --> 03:59:18.180 align:start position:0%
mentioned it isn't it isn't long-term
 
03:59:19.849 --> 03:59:19.859 align:start position:0%
boilerplate like the other sections
 
03:59:21.889 --> 03:59:21.899 align:start position:0%
you've been discussing
 
03:59:25.309 --> 03:59:25.319 align:start position:0%
all right so so for I I think I'm okay
 
03:59:27.769 --> 03:59:27.779 align:start position:0%
with just leaving it for the biennium is
 
03:59:29.570 --> 03:59:29.580 align:start position:0%
there any opposition to just leaving it
 
03:59:31.610 --> 03:59:31.620 align:start position:0%
for the biennium
 
03:59:36.170 --> 03:59:36.180 align:start position:0%
leave it okay eight nothing
 
03:59:40.150 --> 03:59:40.160 align:start position:0%
all right so now we're on 221
 
03:59:44.889 --> 03:59:44.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:47.689 --> 03:59:47.699 align:start position:0%
so this would allow
 
03:59:49.849 --> 03:59:49.859 align:start position:0%
the department to carry forward funds
 
03:59:51.170 --> 03:59:51.180 align:start position:0%
from the division of Medicaid services
 
03:59:52.729 --> 03:59:52.739 align:start position:0%
and I believe Nathan mentioned this is
 
03:59:54.050 --> 03:59:54.060 align:start position:0%
projected to be about five million
 
03:59:55.729 --> 03:59:55.739 align:start position:0%
dollars this year uh into the next
 
03:59:57.530 --> 03:59:57.540 align:start position:0%
biennium and treat it as restricted
 
03:59:59.450 --> 03:59:59.460 align:start position:0%
revenue for the purpose of funding
 
03:59:59.460 --> 04:00:03.950 align:start position:0%
revenue for the purpose of funding
Medicaid

04:00:03.950 --> 04:00:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:05.990 --> 04:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
okay we have talked about this in
 
04:00:08.150 --> 04:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
previous hearings I don't recall anyone
 
04:00:10.670 --> 04:00:10.680 align:start position:0%
really being opposed to this is anyone
 
04:00:14.689 --> 04:00:14.699 align:start position:0%
opposed to it now uh representative let
 
04:00:16.670 --> 04:00:16.680 align:start position:0%
me ask you a question
 
04:00:19.189 --> 04:00:19.199 align:start position:0%
so this is what you just said Kevin that
 
04:00:22.490 --> 04:00:22.500 align:start position:0%
basically this year it would lapse five
 
04:00:24.530 --> 04:00:24.540 align:start position:0%
million dollars that this was removed
 
04:00:26.150 --> 04:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
that's correct yes which essentially
 
04:00:27.410 --> 04:00:27.420 align:start position:0%
gave us another five million dollars in
 
04:00:29.750 --> 04:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
Surplus to work with
 
04:00:32.210 --> 04:00:32.220 align:start position:0%
it would okay so yeah I'm opposed just
 
04:00:33.889 --> 04:00:33.899 align:start position:0%
because we need money
 
04:00:34.729 --> 04:00:34.739 align:start position:0%
um for all these other things we're
 
04:00:36.290 --> 04:00:36.300 align:start position:0%
doing so that's my reason for being
 
04:00:38.630 --> 04:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
opposed also if we but just to do the
 
04:00:41.330 --> 04:00:41.340 align:start position:0%
other side of that coin if if we do roll
 
04:00:44.389 --> 04:00:44.399 align:start position:0%
it Forward isn't this a source of funds
 
04:00:47.150 --> 04:00:47.160 align:start position:0%
for what we may want to do next fiscal
 
04:00:48.650 --> 04:00:48.660 align:start position:0%
year for
 
04:00:51.170 --> 04:00:51.180 align:start position:0%
paying for some of these targeted rate
 
04:00:54.170 --> 04:00:54.180 align:start position:0%
increases and the like if if we if we
 
04:00:57.170 --> 04:00:57.180 align:start position:0%
lapse it it goes to the rainy day fund I
 
04:00:59.809 --> 04:00:59.819 align:start position:0%
believe and it's harder to get back down
 
04:01:02.269 --> 04:01:02.279 align:start position:0%
out of the cloud to fund anything we
 
04:01:07.729 --> 04:01:07.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:09.469 --> 04:01:09.479 align:start position:0%
prove that this this would otherwise be
 
04:01:11.570 --> 04:01:11.580 align:start position:0%
a 23 laps and any excess that you have
 
04:01:13.490 --> 04:01:13.500 align:start position:0%
in 23 would go into the rainy day fund
 
04:01:17.030 --> 04:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
and be harder to access in later years
 
04:01:19.070 --> 04:01:19.080 align:start position:0%
but what could we access it right now so
 
04:01:20.990 --> 04:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
to speak you could access it if you were
 
04:01:22.910 --> 04:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
to make a an appropriation out of fiscal
 
04:01:26.030 --> 04:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:28.849 --> 04:01:28.859 align:start position:0%
so I I just want to follow up on that
 
04:01:30.710 --> 04:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
are you are you thinking you want to
 
04:01:33.530 --> 04:01:33.540 align:start position:0%
change this language so that any lapse
 
04:01:35.450 --> 04:01:35.460 align:start position:0%
goes to something directed that you may
 
04:01:38.990 --> 04:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
have an idea for well yeah I gotta
 
04:01:40.429 --> 04:01:40.439 align:start position:0%
where's that page
 
04:01:42.590 --> 04:01:42.600 align:start position:0%
yeah so I got I got 100 million if
 
04:01:43.729 --> 04:01:43.739 align:start position:0%
you're talking to this side of the
 
04:01:45.889 --> 04:01:45.899 align:start position:0%
defense except for my good friend over
 
04:01:47.389 --> 04:01:47.399 align:start position:0%
here and 200 million talking to the
 
04:01:48.349 --> 04:01:48.359 align:start position:0%
other side of the fence from what I hear
 
04:01:50.630 --> 04:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
so five million would help
 
04:01:52.610 --> 04:01:52.620 align:start position:0%
that's all I'm thinking that instead of
 
04:01:53.689 --> 04:01:53.699 align:start position:0%
just having it rolled into where
 
04:01:55.790 --> 04:01:55.800 align:start position:0%
Medicaid can use it and I get that it's
 
04:01:57.769 --> 04:01:57.779 align:start position:0%
useful to them as well but if we're
 
04:01:59.870 --> 04:01:59.880 align:start position:0%
trying to punch a lot of money into a
 
04:02:02.030 --> 04:02:02.040 align:start position:0%
specific areas
 
04:02:03.710 --> 04:02:03.720 align:start position:0%
it's another five million dollars okay
 
04:02:05.750 --> 04:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
so I'm hearing you would not accept this
 
04:02:08.090 --> 04:02:08.100 align:start position:0%
language as is you would want to amend
 
04:02:10.969 --> 04:02:10.979 align:start position:0%
this hp2 item so that we can direct the
 
04:02:13.490 --> 04:02:13.500 align:start position:0%
5 million to something more targeted
 
04:02:16.729 --> 04:02:16.739 align:start position:0%
yes tremendous as needed if if that's
 
04:02:18.410 --> 04:02:18.420 align:start position:0%
what's required do you have a comment
 
04:02:20.389 --> 04:02:20.399 align:start position:0%
representative hole that was good I was
 
04:02:21.950 --> 04:02:21.960 align:start position:0%
going to ask the same thing and Mr
 
04:02:23.750 --> 04:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
Ripple draft something up we just need
 
04:02:24.769 --> 04:02:24.779 align:start position:0%
to figure out where we would like to
 
04:02:25.969 --> 04:02:25.979 align:start position:0%
push the money to
 
04:02:28.070 --> 04:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
do you have comments I just want to be
 
04:02:30.710 --> 04:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
sure I'm clear that this this would
 
04:02:32.630 --> 04:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
become 23 money
 
04:02:34.550 --> 04:02:34.560 align:start position:0%
is that right we would have to spend it
 
04:02:38.990 --> 04:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
in 23. so the the the purpose of this
 
04:02:41.809 --> 04:02:41.819 align:start position:0%
particular section was to bring forward
 
04:02:43.969 --> 04:02:43.979 align:start position:0%
funds from this current biennium into
 
04:02:46.670 --> 04:02:46.680 align:start position:0%
the next for this program because we are
 
04:02:49.010 --> 04:02:49.020 align:start position:0%
dealing with what is an unprecedented
 
04:02:51.469 --> 04:02:51.479 align:start position:0%
situation where our Medicaid roles have
 
04:02:53.990 --> 04:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
increased up to 250
 
04:02:57.769 --> 04:02:57.779 align:start position:0%
000 and we do a plan to and we and we do
 
04:02:59.929 --> 04:02:59.939 align:start position:0%
intend to disenroll
 
04:03:01.969 --> 04:03:01.979 align:start position:0%
um tens of thousands of individuals we
 
04:03:03.590 --> 04:03:03.600 align:start position:0%
have a lot of assumptions we have very
 
04:03:05.870 --> 04:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
good predictive models but at the end of
 
04:03:07.729 --> 04:03:07.739 align:start position:0%
the day those are predictive models it's
 
04:03:09.710 --> 04:03:09.720 align:start position:0%
a plan it's a Point of Departure this
 
04:03:11.269 --> 04:03:11.279 align:start position:0%
allows a little bit of wiggle room to
 
04:03:14.750 --> 04:03:14.760 align:start position:0%
address that if we are wrong then we may
 
04:03:21.320 --> 04:03:21.330 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:21.330 --> 04:03:23.750 align:start position:0%

04:03:35.330 --> 04:03:35.340 align:start position:0%
Mr Ripple has a comment it depends on
 
04:03:37.010 --> 04:03:37.020 align:start position:0%
how you choose to use it if you delete
 
04:03:38.870 --> 04:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
this section that's exactly right you'll
 
04:03:40.610 --> 04:03:40.620 align:start position:0%
have five million dollars in fiscal 23
 
04:03:43.550 --> 04:03:43.560 align:start position:0%
to spend out of 23 money you could
 
04:03:46.250 --> 04:03:46.260 align:start position:0%
revise this section to carry it forward
 
04:03:48.290 --> 04:03:48.300 align:start position:0%
and spend on some other purpose in 24
 
04:03:48.300 --> 04:03:50.150 align:start position:0%
and spend on some other purpose in 24
25.

04:03:50.150 --> 04:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
25.
 
04:03:52.010 --> 04:03:52.020 align:start position:0%
the more straightforward approach would
 
04:03:55.550 --> 04:03:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:58.370 --> 04:03:58.380 align:start position:0%
representative hole I apologize for
 
04:03:59.870 --> 04:03:59.880 align:start position:0%
missing the discussion this morning but
 
04:04:01.429 --> 04:04:01.439 align:start position:0%
it might be relevant now that if we
 
04:04:04.370 --> 04:04:04.380 align:start position:0%
pushed this amount of money over to some
 
04:04:06.889 --> 04:04:06.899 align:start position:0%
of the proposed rate increases that
 
04:04:09.110 --> 04:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
04:04:11.450 --> 04:04:11.460 align:start position:0%
um that was like 40 million dollars if I
 
04:04:12.889 --> 04:04:12.899 align:start position:0%
recall from earlier our earlier
 
04:04:12.899 --> 04:04:14.210 align:start position:0%
recall from earlier our earlier
discussions

04:04:14.210 --> 04:04:14.220 align:start position:0%
discussions
 
04:04:16.729 --> 04:04:16.739 align:start position:0%
that would help offset some of the costs
 
04:04:18.290 --> 04:04:18.300 align:start position:0%
that we need to come up in this biennium
 
04:04:20.809 --> 04:04:20.819 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if Mr Ripple can make
 
04:04:22.610 --> 04:04:22.620 align:start position:0%
language that says it but that would be
 
04:04:24.530 --> 04:04:24.540 align:start position:0%
one place I would be proposing to push
 
04:04:27.950 --> 04:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
the money I I have a question is go
 
04:04:30.410 --> 04:04:30.420 align:start position:0%
ahead before you do though just because
 
04:04:33.710 --> 04:04:33.720 align:start position:0%
you missed the discussion the uh our our
 
04:04:35.809 --> 04:04:35.819 align:start position:0%
friends on the other side of the aisle
 
04:04:37.670 --> 04:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
are thinking in terms of 200 million
 
04:04:39.290 --> 04:04:39.300 align:start position:0%
while we're thinking in terms of 50
 
04:04:43.849 --> 04:04:43.859 align:start position:0%
million so so this 5 million is is you
 
04:04:46.610 --> 04:04:46.620 align:start position:0%
know budget dust in the balance between
 
04:04:49.370 --> 04:04:49.380 align:start position:0%
those go ahead represent stream yeah so
 
04:04:52.070 --> 04:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
if if we if we just kept this that money
 
04:04:53.689 --> 04:04:53.699 align:start position:0%
would be in Medicaid and it could be
 
04:04:55.429 --> 04:04:55.439 align:start position:0%
used for rate increases
 
04:04:58.130 --> 04:04:58.140 align:start position:0%
uh as written is that correct
 
04:04:59.450 --> 04:04:59.460 align:start position:0%
which is what we were talking about
 
04:05:01.670 --> 04:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
earlier today
 
04:05:05.210 --> 04:05:05.220 align:start position:0%
yes again again the the lapse figure is
 
04:05:07.490 --> 04:05:07.500 align:start position:0%
projected um we're still a number of
 
04:05:09.110 --> 04:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
months out so the five million dollar
 
04:05:11.750 --> 04:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
figure is is a certain assumption
 
04:05:13.910 --> 04:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
I want an absolute guarantee going
 
04:05:20.210 --> 04:05:20.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:21.950 --> 04:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
04:05:24.290 --> 04:05:24.300 align:start position:0%
so I you know every time I've heard this
 
04:05:26.150 --> 04:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
I felt like this is sort of a shock
 
04:05:29.030 --> 04:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
absorber so that as we're we're getting
 
04:05:31.450 --> 04:05:31.460 align:start position:0%
people Unwound from the current
 
04:05:35.330 --> 04:05:35.340 align:start position:0%
eligibility if we make any errors you
 
04:05:37.010 --> 04:05:37.020 align:start position:0%
know there's some money in there to to
 
04:05:40.429 --> 04:05:40.439 align:start position:0%
give us a cushion to continue uh with
 
04:05:42.710 --> 04:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
with funding without the department
 
04:05:44.870 --> 04:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
having to come to the fiscal committee
 
04:05:47.210 --> 04:05:47.220 align:start position:0%
and that by the time we get completely
 
04:05:49.729 --> 04:05:49.739 align:start position:0%
through with the unwind in a in a year
 
04:05:50.769 --> 04:05:50.779 align:start position:0%
or so
 
04:05:53.570 --> 04:05:53.580 align:start position:0%
it just has felt to me that the odds of
 
04:05:55.070 --> 04:05:55.080 align:start position:0%
this there being much of that five
 
04:05:57.650 --> 04:05:57.660 align:start position:0%
million are fairly low so every time
 
04:06:01.130 --> 04:06:01.140 align:start position:0%
I've heard this I've been led to leave
 
04:06:03.410 --> 04:06:03.420 align:start position:0%
it thinking that we should leave this
 
04:06:06.550 --> 04:06:06.560 align:start position:0%
paragraph alone but I'm open to
 
04:06:09.769 --> 04:06:09.779 align:start position:0%
Representatives thoughts I well I don't
 
04:06:11.150 --> 04:06:11.160 align:start position:0%
disagree with your comments I would note
 
04:06:13.010 --> 04:06:13.020 align:start position:0%
that there's another item in hp2
 
04:06:15.469 --> 04:06:15.479 align:start position:0%
specifically dedicated to the issue you
 
04:06:17.030 --> 04:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
just raised which is the whole rolling
 
04:06:18.650 --> 04:06:18.660 align:start position:0%
off thing it's not coming from this
 
04:06:18.660 --> 04:06:19.969 align:start position:0%
off thing it's not coming from this
piece

04:06:19.969 --> 04:06:19.979 align:start position:0%
piece
 
04:06:21.530 --> 04:06:21.540 align:start position:0%
I mean not to say it can't come from
 
04:06:22.790 --> 04:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
this piece but there's a whole piece
 
04:06:24.590 --> 04:06:24.600 align:start position:0%
dedicated to that I'm curious do you
 
04:06:27.950 --> 04:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:35.110 --> 04:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:39.889 --> 04:06:39.899 align:start position:0%
it's uh on page 80 uh section 237 it's
 
04:06:45.229 --> 04:06:45.239 align:start position:0%
it's a 16.38 or 16.35 8 million dollars
 
04:06:48.349 --> 04:06:48.359 align:start position:0%
um I I think one important thing to
 
04:06:48.359 --> 04:06:49.429 align:start position:0%
um I I think one important thing to
remember

04:06:49.429 --> 04:06:49.439 align:start position:0%
remember
 
04:06:51.710 --> 04:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
um that that particular figure that is
 
04:06:53.450 --> 04:06:53.460 align:start position:0%
based on our best estimate at this point
 
04:06:54.469 --> 04:06:54.479 align:start position:0%
in time
 
04:06:56.210 --> 04:06:56.220 align:start position:0%
um when we when I'm thinking about the
 
04:06:57.530 --> 04:06:57.540 align:start position:0%
carry forward and you can probably very
 
04:07:00.050 --> 04:07:00.060 align:start position:0%
clearly Mark see my perspective on it
 
04:07:02.630 --> 04:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
um that is a it's almost surrounding
 
04:07:04.550 --> 04:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
error when we look at the total budget
 
04:07:07.550 --> 04:07:07.560 align:start position:0%
for Medicaid it's it's relatively small
 
04:07:09.769 --> 04:07:09.779 align:start position:0%
amount so our estimates on a on a
 
04:07:11.990 --> 04:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
regular basis are are very very good
 
04:07:13.429 --> 04:07:13.439 align:start position:0%
they're generally within a percentage
 
04:07:16.130 --> 04:07:16.140 align:start position:0%
point it's just that every single person
 
04:07:18.650 --> 04:07:18.660 align:start position:0%
that is unenrolled or disenrolled from
 
04:07:21.469 --> 04:07:21.479 align:start position:0%
the program has a right to an appeal and
 
04:07:23.750 --> 04:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
while they are in that appeal status we
 
04:07:26.870 --> 04:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
have to keep paying uh for for for them
 
04:07:29.269 --> 04:07:29.279 align:start position:0%
uh so that's that's just a risk that I
 
04:07:33.050 --> 04:07:33.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:37.130 --> 04:07:37.140 align:start position:0%
okay so so so being and personally
 
04:07:40.910 --> 04:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
agnostic about the policy issue then the
 
04:07:43.849 --> 04:07:43.859 align:start position:0%
that secondary issue for me is keep it
 
04:07:43.859 --> 04:07:44.750 align:start position:0%
that secondary issue for me is keep it
simple

04:07:44.750 --> 04:07:44.760 align:start position:0%
simple
 
04:07:47.450 --> 04:07:47.460 align:start position:0%
uh it by not changing it it's less work
 
04:07:50.750 --> 04:07:50.760 align:start position:0%
for Mr Ripple and OLS and it's it's
 
04:07:54.290 --> 04:07:54.300 align:start position:0%
still a safety net uh and there's no
 
04:07:56.809 --> 04:07:56.819 align:start position:0%
downside what's the downside if we put
 
04:07:59.389 --> 04:07:59.399 align:start position:0%
the 5 million in there it's likely to be
 
04:08:01.910 --> 04:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
spent somewhere on Medicaid somewhere I
 
04:08:03.110 --> 04:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
would think
 
04:08:06.290 --> 04:08:06.300 align:start position:0%
what's kind of the worst case it lapses
 
04:08:08.689 --> 04:08:08.699 align:start position:0%
and we get to talk about it again in two
 
04:08:10.189 --> 04:08:10.199 align:start position:0%
years what what's the worst case
 
04:08:12.710 --> 04:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
scenario of unspent money
 
04:08:15.170 --> 04:08:15.180 align:start position:0%
um best case scenario I I think from a
 
04:08:17.570 --> 04:08:17.580 align:start position:0%
budget Statewide budget perspective is
 
04:08:19.490 --> 04:08:19.500 align:start position:0%
it's not spent
 
04:08:22.130 --> 04:08:22.140 align:start position:0%
um one case scenario I don't really want
 
04:08:24.429 --> 04:08:24.439 align:start position:0%
to describe it is it's spent because
 
04:08:26.809 --> 04:08:26.819 align:start position:0%
more people appeal than we originally
 
04:08:28.550 --> 04:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
anticipated and we have higher costs
 
04:08:30.710 --> 04:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
well okay that's the planning thing
 
04:08:32.389 --> 04:08:32.399 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm planning on but if that
 
04:08:34.670 --> 04:08:34.680 align:start position:0%
plan doesn't happen then we still just
 
04:08:36.469 --> 04:08:36.479 align:start position:0%
have the 5 million and it's going to
 
04:08:38.210 --> 04:08:38.220 align:start position:0%
lapse in two years that's what I'm
 
04:08:40.250 --> 04:08:40.260 align:start position:0%
calling the worst case scenario that the
 
04:08:42.110 --> 04:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
plan doesn't work we end up with the
 
04:08:45.590 --> 04:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
extra money yes okay all right and so we
 
04:08:47.870 --> 04:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
so if we don't spend it now in a
 
04:08:50.570 --> 04:08:50.580 align:start position:0%
different way we can revisit it in two
 
04:08:54.410 --> 04:08:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:57.830 --> 04:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
based on that I I I'm going to vote to
 
04:09:00.830 --> 04:09:00.840 align:start position:0%
leave it as is but uh I'm I'm going to
 
04:09:03.710 --> 04:09:03.720 align:start position:0%
do a straw vote now uh is there any more
 
04:09:06.170 --> 04:09:06.180 align:start position:0%
discussion on that lineup
 
04:09:08.990 --> 04:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
okay if you are in favor of retaining
 
04:09:11.210 --> 04:09:11.220 align:start position:0%
this language as is please raise your
 
04:09:11.220 --> 04:09:13.550 align:start position:0%
this language as is please raise your
hand

04:09:13.550 --> 04:09:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:17.090 --> 04:09:17.100 align:start position:0%
okay if you were opposed to
 
04:09:19.790 --> 04:09:19.800 align:start position:0%
okay so I'm going to put that as six to
 
04:09:23.389 --> 04:09:23.399 align:start position:0%
two and and and if you all want to for
 
04:09:25.550 --> 04:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
Monday propose alternative language to
 
04:09:27.170 --> 04:09:27.180 align:start position:0%
it what you would do with that you know
 
04:09:30.530 --> 04:09:30.540 align:start position:0%
we can talk about that Monday I suppose
 
04:09:30.540 --> 04:09:32.630 align:start position:0%
we can talk about that Monday I suppose
okay

04:09:32.630 --> 04:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:09:32.640 --> 04:09:33.830 align:start position:0%
okay
um

04:09:33.830 --> 04:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:37.370 --> 04:09:37.380 align:start position:0%
section 222 do you I can't help but
 
04:09:41.450 --> 04:09:41.460 align:start position:0%
think of that old TV show but 222. do
 
04:09:43.429 --> 04:09:43.439 align:start position:0%
you have um
 
04:09:45.910 --> 04:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
something to say about this
 
04:09:50.090 --> 04:09:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:51.710 --> 04:09:51.720 align:start position:0%
this requires the department to if
 
04:09:53.330 --> 04:09:53.340 align:start position:0%
needed submit a Medicaid State Plan
 
04:09:54.889 --> 04:09:54.899 align:start position:0%
amendment to establish and provide
 
04:09:56.450 --> 04:09:56.460 align:start position:0%
preventative health care benefits under
 
04:09:58.309 --> 04:09:58.319 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid Program and this is a new
 
04:09:58.319 --> 04:10:12.849 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid Program and this is a new
section

04:10:12.849 --> 04:10:12.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:15.290 --> 04:10:15.300 align:start position:0%
am I right this is just a program
 
04:10:18.670 --> 04:10:18.680 align:start position:0%
authorization with no specific funding
 
04:10:22.130 --> 04:10:22.140 align:start position:0%
that sounds wrong
 
04:10:23.990 --> 04:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
that's true there's no
 
04:10:32.269 --> 04:10:32.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:35.510 --> 04:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
so this is pure policy no money Mr chair
 
04:10:38.090 --> 04:10:38.100 align:start position:0%
let me let me just finish
 
04:10:40.729 --> 04:10:40.739 align:start position:0%
please that's that's well there's
 
04:10:42.710 --> 04:10:42.720 align:start position:0%
clearly no appropriation whether there's
 
04:10:44.570 --> 04:10:44.580 align:start position:0%
no fiscal impact I'm not sure I would
 
04:10:46.910 --> 04:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
let Nathan speak to that okay but this
 
04:10:49.370 --> 04:10:49.380 align:start position:0%
is predominantly policy
 
04:10:51.889 --> 04:10:51.899 align:start position:0%
yes do you do you want to talk about a
 
04:10:53.750 --> 04:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact or do you have a question
 
04:10:56.210 --> 04:10:56.220 align:start position:0%
now to represent a hole I was going to
 
04:10:59.030 --> 04:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
ask Mr White to fill us in on what
 
04:11:01.130 --> 04:11:01.140 align:start position:0%
potentially happens if this is removed I
 
04:11:02.030 --> 04:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
think we're asking the same question
 
04:11:04.910 --> 04:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
okay good so so so the the this
 
04:11:06.769 --> 04:11:06.779 align:start position:0%
particular item would allow us to engage
 
04:11:10.010 --> 04:11:10.020 align:start position:0%
in these these cost saving programs
 
04:11:11.929 --> 04:11:11.939 align:start position:0%
um through the Medicaid Program
 
04:11:13.010 --> 04:11:13.020 align:start position:0%
um there are a number of citations
 
04:11:15.290 --> 04:11:15.300 align:start position:0%
included in the original document that
 
04:11:18.349 --> 04:11:18.359 align:start position:0%
that I I provided uh to Kevin that Who
 
04:11:20.510 --> 04:11:20.520 align:start position:0%
provided to the committee that
 
04:11:22.910 --> 04:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
identified a few of the examples there
 
04:11:24.650 --> 04:11:24.660 align:start position:0%
um the purpose of this is to lower the
 
04:11:27.650 --> 04:11:27.660 align:start position:0%
cost of the Medicaid Program in in the
 
04:11:29.090 --> 04:11:29.100 align:start position:0%
long run
 
04:11:30.769 --> 04:11:30.779 align:start position:0%
um and and this this would be a starting
 
04:11:30.779 --> 04:11:37.130 align:start position:0%
um and and this this would be a starting
point

04:11:37.130 --> 04:11:37.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:39.950 --> 04:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
I I have commentary does anyone want to
 
04:11:41.870 --> 04:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
speak to this at this point
 
04:11:41.880 --> 04:11:43.070 align:start position:0%
speak to this at this point
I

04:11:43.070 --> 04:11:43.080 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:11:46.790 --> 04:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
you know being an old HHS Alum I I would
 
04:11:49.189 --> 04:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
I would like to uh
 
04:11:51.590 --> 04:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
with those that perspective I'd like to
 
04:11:54.830 --> 04:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
kill this and see this in a bill to be
 
04:11:58.429 --> 04:11:58.439 align:start position:0%
discussed in January if not sooner I I
 
04:11:59.870 --> 04:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
don't I don't know that we should be
 
04:12:03.050 --> 04:12:03.060 align:start position:0%
taking on a pure policy issue uh do you
 
04:12:04.670 --> 04:12:04.680 align:start position:0%
have comments
 
04:12:06.710 --> 04:12:06.720 align:start position:0%
from what Nathan just said it doesn't
 
04:12:09.830 --> 04:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
feel like pure policy to me it seems
 
04:12:13.550 --> 04:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
like it's really here to help
 
04:12:15.590 --> 04:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
save costs
 
04:12:18.530 --> 04:12:18.540 align:start position:0%
particularly out into the future and
 
04:12:22.809 --> 04:12:22.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:25.429 --> 04:12:25.439 align:start position:0%
I'd say since the program doesn't exist
 
04:12:28.670 --> 04:12:28.680 align:start position:0%
that's Theory it's so there's a policy
 
04:12:31.250 --> 04:12:31.260 align:start position:0%
implication first do we is do we think
 
04:12:33.290 --> 04:12:33.300 align:start position:0%
this is good policy or not we're
 
04:12:35.330 --> 04:12:35.340 align:start position:0%
bypassing the policy committee we're not
 
04:12:37.090 --> 04:12:37.100 align:start position:0%
getting their input and advice
 
04:12:45.250 --> 04:12:45.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:48.229 --> 04:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
this document that we're looking at yeah
 
04:12:50.389 --> 04:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
and it it shows all the different
 
04:12:52.849 --> 04:12:52.859 align:start position:0%
programs yes ma'am and I think what
 
04:12:55.309 --> 04:12:55.319 align:start position:0%
representative Waldner said I mean I
 
04:12:58.750 --> 04:12:58.760 align:start position:0%
think these are all preventive
 
04:13:01.729 --> 04:13:01.739 align:start position:0%
programs to try to cut the budget rather
 
04:13:01.739 --> 04:13:03.650 align:start position:0%
programs to try to cut the budget rather
than

04:13:03.650 --> 04:13:03.660 align:start position:0%
than
 
04:13:05.210 --> 04:13:05.220 align:start position:0%
have us
 
04:13:07.250 --> 04:13:07.260 align:start position:0%
delivering these Services when we could
 
04:13:10.070 --> 04:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
be doing something to alleviate some of
 
04:13:13.010 --> 04:13:13.020 align:start position:0%
them thank you so I'm just curious am I
 
04:13:14.689 --> 04:13:14.699 align:start position:0%
am I the only one that's thinking that
 
04:13:16.610 --> 04:13:16.620 align:start position:0%
we should just kill this out of hb2
 
04:13:19.610 --> 04:13:19.620 align:start position:0%
because this is this is really first and
 
04:13:22.370 --> 04:13:22.380 align:start position:0%
foremost a policy issue given that
 
04:13:25.250 --> 04:13:25.260 align:start position:0%
there's no direct appropriation involved
 
04:13:27.590 --> 04:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
if there's anyone does anyone else agree
 
04:13:29.809 --> 04:13:29.819 align:start position:0%
with that well I I think I think you
 
04:13:32.570 --> 04:13:32.580 align:start position:0%
have a point it is it is policy I mean
 
04:13:34.729 --> 04:13:34.739 align:start position:0%
there is a pretty extensive effort
 
04:13:35.990 --> 04:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
nationally called the national
 
04:13:39.950 --> 04:13:39.960 align:start position:0%
preventative health care task force that
 
04:13:44.150 --> 04:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
um that uh meets and comes up with items
 
04:13:45.590 --> 04:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
like these that are essentially
 
04:13:50.090 --> 04:13:50.100 align:start position:0%
self-funded medical services and
 
04:13:52.910 --> 04:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
um uh I'm assuming that's where where
 
04:13:56.030 --> 04:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
these come out but the word assume is a
 
04:13:58.189 --> 04:13:58.199 align:start position:0%
dangerous word so
 
04:13:58.199 --> 04:13:58.910 align:start position:0%
dangerous word so
um

04:13:58.910 --> 04:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:03.110 --> 04:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
and um uh you know I I wouldn't mind
 
04:14:05.090 --> 04:14:05.100 align:start position:0%
having Health and Human Services input
 
04:14:07.429 --> 04:14:07.439 align:start position:0%
on this or oh
 
04:14:10.429 --> 04:14:10.439 align:start position:0%
um uh either because these things these
 
04:14:13.490 --> 04:14:13.500 align:start position:0%
things do cost money and they do save
 
04:14:17.510 --> 04:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
money on the on the back the back end I
 
04:14:18.710 --> 04:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
can't tell you that whether their
 
04:14:21.410 --> 04:14:21.420 align:start position:0%
revenue will cost neutral or not
 
04:14:21.420 --> 04:14:22.969 align:start position:0%
revenue will cost neutral or not
so

04:14:22.969 --> 04:14:22.979 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:14:24.889 --> 04:14:24.899 align:start position:0%
you know there's a lot of discretion
 
04:14:29.030 --> 04:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
already in DHHS if if these were good
 
04:14:32.090 --> 04:14:32.100 align:start position:0%
programs aren't there sister programs or
 
04:14:34.610 --> 04:14:34.620 align:start position:0%
compatible programs already that could
 
04:14:36.590 --> 04:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
be leveraged like I know under the
 
04:14:39.710 --> 04:14:39.720 align:start position:0%
nicotine secession we do have a
 
04:14:42.650 --> 04:14:42.660 align:start position:0%
department that manages in part a
 
04:14:47.450 --> 04:14:47.460 align:start position:0%
smoking secession component so so so if
 
04:14:50.210 --> 04:14:50.220 align:start position:0%
we don't do this in hb2
 
04:14:52.729 --> 04:14:52.739 align:start position:0%
the department could still do it if they
 
04:14:54.950 --> 04:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
expand these programs if they wanted to
 
04:14:57.349 --> 04:14:57.359 align:start position:0%
without legislative Authority could they
 
04:15:00.110 --> 04:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
not this would be explicit authorization
 
04:15:02.269 --> 04:15:02.279 align:start position:0%
for the Department to submit a state
 
04:15:04.309 --> 04:15:04.319 align:start position:0%
plan Amendment for these types of
 
04:15:04.319 --> 04:15:06.469 align:start position:0%
plan Amendment for these types of
programs

04:15:06.469 --> 04:15:06.479 align:start position:0%
programs
 
04:15:17.570 --> 04:15:17.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:20.689 --> 04:15:20.699 align:start position:0%
Mr chair uh go ahead I believe under
 
04:15:24.410 --> 04:15:24.420 align:start position:0%
house Rule 36 B
 
04:15:27.229 --> 04:15:27.239 align:start position:0%
right a committee the majority of the
 
04:15:29.210 --> 04:15:29.220 align:start position:0%
committee can request the drafting of a
 
04:15:31.309 --> 04:15:31.319 align:start position:0%
bill past the deadline if I understand
 
04:15:33.830 --> 04:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
this correctly so we could pull this out
 
04:15:35.929 --> 04:15:35.939 align:start position:0%
and make this its own independent bill
 
04:15:38.330 --> 04:15:38.340 align:start position:0%
in parallel although I don't know that
 
04:15:39.830 --> 04:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
it would complete the process for other
 
04:15:42.950 --> 04:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
house deadlines until next year
 
04:15:46.610 --> 04:15:46.620 align:start position:0%
but we could do what you suggested
 
04:15:48.830 --> 04:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
so so we're waiting on representative
 
04:15:52.070 --> 04:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
Weiler uh to to actually vote on this uh
 
04:15:54.050 --> 04:15:54.060 align:start position:0%
so but I don't mind continuing the
 
04:15:56.030 --> 04:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
discussion I I just would like to see
 
04:15:57.889 --> 04:15:57.899 align:start position:0%
this go to a policy committee somehow
 
04:16:00.349 --> 04:16:00.359 align:start position:0%
whether we you know kicked it over to
 
04:16:02.809 --> 04:16:02.819 align:start position:0%
HHS now they can't complete their work
 
04:16:06.710 --> 04:16:06.720 align:start position:0%
before we're done with our work but we
 
04:16:08.990 --> 04:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
could maybe recommend it to a Senate
 
04:16:11.090 --> 04:16:11.100 align:start position:0%
bill that perhaps they have that they
 
04:16:14.990 --> 04:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
could amend i i as a rule I've been
 
04:16:17.809 --> 04:16:17.819 align:start position:0%
informed by my seniors that we shouldn't
 
04:16:19.969 --> 04:16:19.979 align:start position:0%
do peer policy stuff and this feels like
 
04:16:22.790 --> 04:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
peer policy so
 
04:16:25.070 --> 04:16:25.080 align:start position:0%
um so we're I'm gonna I'm gonna hold off
 
04:16:28.429 --> 04:16:28.439 align:start position:0%
on a straw vote on this
 
04:16:32.030 --> 04:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:34.790 --> 04:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
okay so you have a bunch of stuff on
 
04:16:34.800 --> 04:16:37.130 align:start position:0%
okay so you have a bunch of stuff on
this

04:16:37.130 --> 04:16:37.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:39.650 --> 04:16:39.660 align:start position:0%
well what I have for you is the
 
04:16:41.750 --> 04:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
Department's proposed House Bill one
 
04:16:44.090 --> 04:16:44.100 align:start position:0%
budget for this Nunu Center which if the
 
04:16:46.010 --> 04:16:46.020 align:start position:0%
Committees were so inclined could come
 
04:16:47.630 --> 04:16:47.640 align:start position:0%
out of House Bill 2 and be funded in the
 
04:16:49.070 --> 04:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
operating budget instead so would you
 
04:16:52.370 --> 04:16:52.380 align:start position:0%
like me to hand that out I I think so I
 
04:16:55.729 --> 04:16:55.739 align:start position:0%
I I we we have Decades of experience of
 
04:16:58.309 --> 04:16:58.319 align:start position:0%
house bill one funding the sununu center
 
04:17:01.189 --> 04:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
we're going to anticipate in the future
 
04:17:04.010 --> 04:17:04.020 align:start position:0%
the sununu center having expenses in the
 
04:17:06.769 --> 04:17:06.779 align:start position:0%
future so rather than this being the one
 
04:17:11.689 --> 04:17:11.699 align:start position:0%
weird year where the budget is in hb2
 
04:17:14.450 --> 04:17:14.460 align:start position:0%
this is an attempt to say do we want to
 
04:17:17.809 --> 04:17:17.819 align:start position:0%
put this into hb1
 
04:17:22.370 --> 04:17:22.380 align:start position:0%
I I think we do uh the question I think
 
04:17:25.070 --> 04:17:25.080 align:start position:0%
that the committee should address as we
 
04:17:28.610 --> 04:17:28.620 align:start position:0%
vote is is it worth the effort that
 
04:17:31.969 --> 04:17:31.979 align:start position:0%
we're going to ask LBA to do to Move It
 
04:17:34.309 --> 04:17:34.319 align:start position:0%
from uh because we're not we're not
 
04:17:36.050 --> 04:17:36.060 align:start position:0%
debating the dollar amount right now
 
04:17:37.490 --> 04:17:37.500 align:start position:0%
we're just talking about where should it
 
04:17:40.309 --> 04:17:40.319 align:start position:0%
be should it continue to live in hb2 or
 
04:17:42.889 --> 04:17:42.899 align:start position:0%
should we try to put it back into hb1
 
04:17:46.550 --> 04:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
and and and so I'm I'm I'm open to some
 
04:17:48.229 --> 04:17:48.239 align:start position:0%
discussion on that representative
 
04:17:48.239 --> 04:17:49.670 align:start position:0%
discussion on that representative
Wallner

04:17:49.670 --> 04:17:49.680 align:start position:0%
Wallner
 
04:17:54.790 --> 04:17:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:57.410 --> 04:17:57.420 align:start position:0%
legislators are going to be sitting here
 
04:17:59.269 --> 04:17:59.279 align:start position:0%
looking at the budget and they won't
 
04:18:02.330 --> 04:18:02.340 align:start position:0%
have the historical numbers and I really
 
04:18:04.370 --> 04:18:04.380 align:start position:0%
think that's you know it should be there
 
04:18:06.889 --> 04:18:06.899 align:start position:0%
and not just blank pages
 
04:18:10.610 --> 04:18:10.620 align:start position:0%
so I know why it happened this time but
 
04:18:11.870 --> 04:18:11.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't I don't think it should happen
 
04:18:13.910 --> 04:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
in the future I just have a technical
 
04:18:16.490 --> 04:18:16.500 align:start position:0%
question for um once we do get a new
 
04:18:16.500 --> 04:18:18.410 align:start position:0%
question for um once we do get a new
facility

04:18:18.410 --> 04:18:18.420 align:start position:0%
facility
 
04:18:21.050 --> 04:18:21.060 align:start position:0%
um it's I presume not going to be called
 
04:18:24.170 --> 04:18:24.180 align:start position:0%
the sununu Youth Services Center so will
 
04:18:26.630 --> 04:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
that line item continue through or are
 
04:18:28.550 --> 04:18:28.560 align:start position:0%
we going to start fresh with a new one
 
04:18:30.710 --> 04:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
like where is that break going to be in
 
04:18:32.809 --> 04:18:32.819 align:start position:0%
terms of bookkeeping I guess
 
04:18:36.650 --> 04:18:36.660 align:start position:0%
my go ahead my guess is the line items
 
04:18:38.870 --> 04:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
the history will change that there's
 
04:18:41.630 --> 04:18:41.640 align:start position:0%
stay constant rather consistent it's
 
04:18:43.729 --> 04:18:43.739 align:start position:0%
just the naming change at the at the top
 
04:18:46.370 --> 04:18:46.380 align:start position:0%
of the line yeah we we would likely work
 
04:18:47.570 --> 04:18:47.580 align:start position:0%
with the Department of administrative
 
04:18:49.610 --> 04:18:49.620 align:start position:0%
services to carry that history forward
 
04:18:51.469 --> 04:18:51.479 align:start position:0%
it'll probably end up being a new
 
04:18:53.389 --> 04:18:53.399 align:start position:0%
accounting unit it's it's kind of a
 
04:18:54.590 --> 04:18:54.600 align:start position:0%
question that we would just have to work
 
04:18:57.110 --> 04:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
out with with Das to to figure out what
 
04:18:59.210 --> 04:18:59.220 align:start position:0%
that would look like in in future uh
 
04:19:01.969 --> 04:19:01.979 align:start position:0%
future biennia okay but just to be clear
 
04:19:03.889 --> 04:19:03.899 align:start position:0%
I think I agree with representative
 
04:19:06.050 --> 04:19:06.060 align:start position:0%
walner that having zeros there for the
 
04:19:07.670 --> 04:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
biennium is not the best
 
04:19:09.950 --> 04:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
choice for it all right
 
04:19:11.990 --> 04:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:19:12.000 --> 04:19:14.030 align:start position:0%
all right
um

04:19:14.030 --> 04:19:14.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:18.229 --> 04:19:18.239 align:start position:0%
any other discussion on this I I there
 
04:19:20.450 --> 04:19:20.460 align:start position:0%
okay so there there could be a lot of
 
04:19:22.849 --> 04:19:22.859 align:start position:0%
discussion on this the first part of the
 
04:19:24.889 --> 04:19:24.899 align:start position:0%
discussion I want to just limit purely
 
04:19:28.969 --> 04:19:28.979 align:start position:0%
to should we be putting the hb2 detail
 
04:19:31.849 --> 04:19:31.859 align:start position:0%
into hb1 there's still the question
 
04:19:33.710 --> 04:19:33.720 align:start position:0%
about whether or not we like these
 
04:19:35.929 --> 04:19:35.939 align:start position:0%
numbers that's not the thing I'm asking
 
04:19:37.670 --> 04:19:37.680 align:start position:0%
right now right now I'm just asking
 
04:19:41.269 --> 04:19:41.279 align:start position:0%
where should this live hp2 or hb1 go
 
04:19:43.729 --> 04:19:43.739 align:start position:0%
ahead represent or so just to clarify Mr
 
04:19:45.590 --> 04:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
Ripple so we do this that essentially
 
04:19:47.570 --> 04:19:47.580 align:start position:0%
gives us 21 million to play with still
 
04:19:50.389 --> 04:19:50.399 align:start position:0%
with the uh FYI 23 Surplus
 
04:19:52.550 --> 04:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
this is actually are we are you using
 
04:19:53.870 --> 04:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
the money from the Surplus and taking it
 
04:19:55.550 --> 04:19:55.560 align:start position:0%
over there this wouldn't save you any
 
04:19:57.050 --> 04:19:57.060 align:start position:0%
money because you'd be removing the
 
04:19:58.729 --> 04:19:58.739 align:start position:0%
appropriation in House Bill 2 and
 
04:20:00.110 --> 04:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
putting it in house bill one instead
 
04:20:01.250 --> 04:20:01.260 align:start position:0%
you're not putting into Hospital alone
 
04:20:01.260 --> 04:20:03.590 align:start position:0%
you're not putting into Hospital alone
okay

04:20:03.590 --> 04:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:05.630 --> 04:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
so this kind of aggravates a problem
 
04:20:07.370 --> 04:20:07.380 align:start position:0%
wait let me just clarify that
 
04:20:10.070 --> 04:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
so are you moving the FY 23 surplus
 
04:20:13.189 --> 04:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
funds to no in in House Bill 2 it's
 
04:20:15.590 --> 04:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
funded in 2425 and it would continue to
 
04:20:20.330 --> 04:20:20.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:24.170 --> 04:20:24.180 align:start position:0%
okay so two votes first vote is a simple
 
04:20:29.510 --> 04:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
one keep it or move it to hb1 or not yes
 
04:20:33.229 --> 04:20:33.239 align:start position:0%
means we move it to hb1 Second vote is
 
04:20:35.269 --> 04:20:35.279 align:start position:0%
going to be related to a simple
 
04:20:37.550 --> 04:20:37.560 align:start position:0%
discussion of whether or not these
 
04:20:41.510 --> 04:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
numbers feel right to you okay so uh
 
04:20:46.210 --> 04:20:46.220 align:start position:0%
stravo show of hands should we move from
 
04:20:50.750 --> 04:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
hp2 to hb1 the accounting for the Sunil
 
04:20:52.490 --> 04:20:52.500 align:start position:0%
Youth Center please raise your hands if
 
04:20:54.650 --> 04:20:54.660 align:start position:0%
you say yes
 
04:20:58.910 --> 04:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
that's unanimous okay thank you uh so so
 
04:21:01.670 --> 04:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
now to the second question and this is
 
04:21:04.370 --> 04:21:04.380 align:start position:0%
probably a Monday discussion because I
 
04:21:07.910 --> 04:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
don't believe any of us have looked at
 
04:21:10.550 --> 04:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
these numbers to where we've can tell
 
04:21:13.849 --> 04:21:13.859 align:start position:0%
from a history whether this feels right
 
04:21:16.429 --> 04:21:16.439 align:start position:0%
so I would like to postpone a discussion
 
04:21:19.309 --> 04:21:19.319 align:start position:0%
on the details of what's in this budget
 
04:21:22.490 --> 04:21:22.500 align:start position:0%
so that we can keep moving through hb2 I
 
04:21:24.650 --> 04:21:24.660 align:start position:0%
would like to add just a nugget here
 
04:21:24.660 --> 04:21:25.910 align:start position:0%
would like to add just a nugget here
though

04:21:25.910 --> 04:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
though
 
04:21:29.389 --> 04:21:29.399 align:start position:0%
we have I think and Mr ribson is here so
 
04:21:30.950 --> 04:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
he can correct me
 
04:21:35.450 --> 04:21:35.460 align:start position:0%
I think we have no clue yet really what
 
04:21:38.870 --> 04:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
the operating budget for the future
 
04:21:41.269 --> 04:21:41.279 align:start position:0%
Youth Center is going to look like
 
04:21:44.870 --> 04:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
because we don't know the design we
 
04:21:46.729 --> 04:21:46.739 align:start position:0%
don't know the extent of the sharing
 
04:21:49.910 --> 04:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
potential uh we you know we don't know
 
04:21:53.269 --> 04:21:53.279 align:start position:0%
what we're going to have to pay to keep
 
04:21:57.590 --> 04:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
the the surrounding towns whole there's
 
04:21:59.870 --> 04:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
just a tremendous that we amount that we
 
04:22:03.530 --> 04:22:03.540 align:start position:0%
don't know so so when we talk about what
 
04:22:06.950 --> 04:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
the future operating costs of the sununu
 
04:22:09.710 --> 04:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
excuse me it's a habit the future
 
04:22:14.630 --> 04:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
replacement we actually don't have an
 
04:22:17.150 --> 04:22:17.160 align:start position:0%
idea yet what that future operating
 
04:22:20.030 --> 04:22:20.040 align:start position:0%
expense is going to be true or false
 
04:22:22.130 --> 04:22:22.140 align:start position:0%
that's correct I also don't think it's
 
04:22:23.510 --> 04:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
likely that it's going to be operational
 
04:22:26.389 --> 04:22:26.399 align:start position:0%
in the biennium right given given the
 
04:22:27.650 --> 04:22:27.660 align:start position:0%
construction time frames and everything
 
04:22:31.969 --> 04:22:31.979 align:start position:0%
else so right so should we think maybe a
 
04:22:33.349 --> 04:22:33.359 align:start position:0%
portion of it might be in the next
 
04:22:35.389 --> 04:22:35.399 align:start position:0%
biennium we don't know
 
04:22:38.030 --> 04:22:38.040 align:start position:0%
so that would be very stupid so let me
 
04:22:39.710 --> 04:22:39.720 align:start position:0%
ask you a question that I think of every
 
04:22:41.809 --> 04:22:41.819 align:start position:0%
time I hear a number
 
04:22:41.819 --> 04:22:42.950 align:start position:0%
time I hear a number
floated

04:22:42.950 --> 04:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
floated
 
04:22:46.010 --> 04:22:46.020 align:start position:0%
what is going to be the process for for
 
04:22:49.070 --> 04:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
the Department to go back to the
 
04:22:52.130 --> 04:22:52.140 align:start position:0%
legislature to say based on these shared
 
04:22:55.010 --> 04:22:55.020 align:start position:0%
services agreements you know based on
 
04:22:58.130 --> 04:22:58.140 align:start position:0%
all the co-location we can do here's
 
04:23:01.070 --> 04:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
what we think we can do in a wise way to
 
04:23:03.710 --> 04:23:03.720 align:start position:0%
to spend these monies and and get some
 
04:23:06.469 --> 04:23:06.479 align:start position:0%
sort of legislative agreement
 
04:23:09.410 --> 04:23:09.420 align:start position:0%
to that kind of level of operating costs
 
04:23:12.170 --> 04:23:12.180 align:start position:0%
what what does that process look like
 
04:23:13.910 --> 04:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
I think it kind of depends on timing of
 
04:23:15.290 --> 04:23:15.300 align:start position:0%
the development of the new facility if
 
04:23:17.450 --> 04:23:17.460 align:start position:0%
it looks likely that this will be ready
 
04:23:19.610 --> 04:23:19.620 align:start position:0%
you know within the next biennium I
 
04:23:20.450 --> 04:23:20.460 align:start position:0%
think it would be part of the
 
04:23:22.309 --> 04:23:22.319 align:start position:0%
conversation in the next budget because
 
04:23:24.229 --> 04:23:24.239 align:start position:0%
at that point you'll know where it's
 
04:23:26.150 --> 04:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
going we'll have plans as to what's
 
04:23:28.070 --> 04:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
going to be there you know it it'll just
 
04:23:29.510 --> 04:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
be much clearer even though it won't be
 
04:23:31.790 --> 04:23:31.800 align:start position:0%
operational yet so I would anticipate
 
04:23:34.070 --> 04:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
that if this is moving on a path that it
 
04:23:36.229 --> 04:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
would be open you know a reasonable time
 
04:23:37.790 --> 04:23:37.800 align:start position:0%
in the next biennium that during the
 
04:23:39.110 --> 04:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
next biennium budget would be a good
 
04:23:41.809 --> 04:23:41.819 align:start position:0%
time to to visit that is it also true
 
04:23:44.330 --> 04:23:44.340 align:start position:0%
that based on what we passed out of the
 
04:23:47.570 --> 04:23:47.580 align:start position:0%
this committee yesterday that there is a
 
04:23:50.870 --> 04:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
reporting obligation to keep oversight
 
04:23:52.969 --> 04:23:52.979 align:start position:0%
up to date on what you're thinking and
 
04:23:55.729 --> 04:23:55.739 align:start position:0%
what's going on is that is that okay so
 
04:23:58.269 --> 04:23:58.279 align:start position:0%
so there is an opportunity for us to
 
04:24:00.830 --> 04:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
progressively elaborate on what the
 
04:24:03.530 --> 04:24:03.540 align:start position:0%
budget might look like before Finance
 
04:24:06.189 --> 04:24:06.199 align:start position:0%
ever looks at it yeah that's true okay
 
04:24:08.630 --> 04:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
uh question
 
04:24:11.030 --> 04:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
director ribson is it possible for
 
04:24:13.130 --> 04:24:13.140 align:start position:0%
Monday before we discuss this that we
 
04:24:15.050 --> 04:24:15.060 align:start position:0%
could understand Staffing levels per
 
04:24:16.550 --> 04:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
shift right
 
04:24:20.570 --> 04:24:20.580 align:start position:0%
not necessarily names but one nurse two
 
04:24:23.349 --> 04:24:23.359 align:start position:0%
Cooks whatever counselors right whatever
 
04:24:26.450 --> 04:24:26.460 align:start position:0%
type staff Broken Out by their primary
 
04:24:30.530 --> 04:24:30.540 align:start position:0%
discipline and each each shift
 
04:24:32.750 --> 04:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
yeah I can try
 
04:24:35.150 --> 04:24:35.160 align:start position:0%
um one thing that and and you know one
 
04:24:36.530 --> 04:24:36.540 align:start position:0%
thing that I would caution about is for
 
04:24:38.450 --> 04:24:38.460 align:start position:0%
the YC's in particular youth counselors
 
04:24:40.070 --> 04:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
in particular
 
04:24:43.130 --> 04:24:43.140 align:start position:0%
um there's often folks who are on leave
 
04:24:44.570 --> 04:24:44.580 align:start position:0%
there's things that you have to build in
 
04:24:47.689 --> 04:24:47.699 align:start position:0%
Beyond just Bare Bones Staffing you know
 
04:24:49.610 --> 04:24:49.620 align:start position:0%
in order to to account for the fact that
 
04:24:52.490 --> 04:24:52.500 align:start position:0%
you unfortunately often have folks who
 
04:24:54.050 --> 04:24:54.060 align:start position:0%
are on medical leave and things like
 
04:24:55.309 --> 04:24:55.319 align:start position:0%
that because of things that happen
 
04:24:57.830 --> 04:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
within the facility how about broadly in
 
04:24:59.990 --> 04:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
terms of what the plan is in the in the
 
04:25:01.130 --> 04:25:01.140 align:start position:0%
current Staffing right I think there's
 
04:25:03.830 --> 04:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
87 full-time positions allocated
 
04:25:05.570 --> 04:25:05.580 align:start position:0%
um one of these are full-time one of
 
04:25:07.969 --> 04:25:07.979 align:start position:0%
these are contracted positions and kind
 
04:25:10.010 --> 04:25:10.020 align:start position:0%
of what is their primary is it the
 
04:25:12.469 --> 04:25:12.479 align:start position:0%
facilities manager is it right is it the
 
04:25:14.929 --> 04:25:14.939 align:start position:0%
control room some high high level two
 
04:25:16.990 --> 04:25:17.000 align:start position:0%
word three-word description of their job
 
04:25:19.309 --> 04:25:19.319 align:start position:0%
and which shifts are working and I
 
04:25:20.990 --> 04:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
understand when you're running a 24 7
 
04:25:23.750 --> 04:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
facility you got to plan for nurse
 
04:25:27.410 --> 04:25:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:29.150 --> 04:25:29.160 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
04:25:32.750 --> 04:25:32.760 align:start position:0%
um one one other could you I I okay if
 
04:25:34.309 --> 04:25:34.319 align:start position:0%
this is important we can do it I I'm
 
04:25:35.929 --> 04:25:35.939 align:start position:0%
just concerned representative Weiler is
 
04:25:37.550 --> 04:25:37.560 align:start position:0%
going to think that this is torture
 
04:25:39.889 --> 04:25:39.899 align:start position:0%
cruel and unusual punishment because we
 
04:25:41.510 --> 04:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
brought him back to vote on a different
 
04:25:44.450 --> 04:25:44.460 align:start position:0%
issue then you're sort of done with
 
04:25:47.870 --> 04:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
sununu I believe so do you think it
 
04:25:49.490 --> 04:25:49.500 align:start position:0%
needs to be asked right now I was just
 
04:25:51.349 --> 04:25:51.359 align:start position:0%
going to say if he's gonna if he's gonna
 
04:25:53.149 --> 04:25:53.159 align:start position:0%
come back with any detail could you also
 
04:25:55.189 --> 04:25:55.199 align:start position:0%
bring detail the only other big ticket
 
04:25:57.590 --> 04:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
item other than employees is the medical
 
04:26:00.889 --> 04:26:00.899 align:start position:0%
expenses of over a million a year so any
 
04:26:02.929 --> 04:26:02.939 align:start position:0%
any color you can add to that would be I
 
04:26:03.889 --> 04:26:03.899 align:start position:0%
mean I could answer that right now if
 
04:26:05.450 --> 04:26:05.460 align:start position:0%
you want but I can talk about it Monday
 
04:26:07.610 --> 04:26:07.620 align:start position:0%
if you want so I'm gonna I'm gonna
 
04:26:10.189 --> 04:26:10.199 align:start position:0%
suspend the discussion on sununu and I'm
 
04:26:12.580 --> 04:26:12.590 align:start position:0%
going to roll back to
 
04:26:12.590 --> 04:26:16.750 align:start position:0%
going to roll back to
[Music]

04:26:16.750 --> 04:26:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:21.950 --> 04:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
222 okay so we're in Room 222 Medicaid
 
04:26:24.590 --> 04:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
State Plan amendment to establish and
 
04:26:26.570 --> 04:26:26.580 align:start position:0%
provide preventive health care benefits
 
04:26:29.269 --> 04:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
under the State Medicaid Program we had
 
04:26:31.550 --> 04:26:31.560 align:start position:0%
a discussion on this
 
04:26:31.560 --> 04:26:32.229 align:start position:0%
a discussion on this
um

04:26:32.229 --> 04:26:32.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:35.030 --> 04:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler
 
04:26:37.969 --> 04:26:37.979 align:start position:0%
this is basically a new program that
 
04:26:42.170 --> 04:26:42.180 align:start position:0%
doesn't include any funding for now
 
04:26:45.889 --> 04:26:45.899 align:start position:0%
but it permits the department to start
 
04:26:48.530 --> 04:26:48.540 align:start position:0%
to further develop because in some
 
04:26:50.450 --> 04:26:50.460 align:start position:0%
instances the the base of the program
 
04:26:52.910 --> 04:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
may already exist but to further
 
04:26:55.910 --> 04:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
development a preventive care program
 
04:26:59.530 --> 04:26:59.540 align:start position:0%
that's intended to save long-term costs
 
04:27:02.389 --> 04:27:02.399 align:start position:0%
and and so
 
04:27:02.399 --> 04:27:03.530 align:start position:0%
and and so
um

04:27:03.530 --> 04:27:03.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:07.490 --> 04:27:07.500 align:start position:0%
my position on this sir was that this
 
04:27:08.929 --> 04:27:08.939 align:start position:0%
since there there's no direct
 
04:27:12.610 --> 04:27:12.620 align:start position:0%
appropriation of money in this hb2 item
 
04:27:15.769 --> 04:27:15.779 align:start position:0%
and that some of these programs exist in
 
04:27:18.590 --> 04:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
some bare minimal form at least such as
 
04:27:20.889 --> 04:27:20.899 align:start position:0%
the nicotine secession program
 
04:27:25.849 --> 04:27:25.859 align:start position:0%
I just assume have this go to a policy
 
04:27:28.849 --> 04:27:28.859 align:start position:0%
committee as part of a statute for
 
04:27:31.969 --> 04:27:31.979 align:start position:0%
debate without Finance taking the first
 
04:27:35.269 --> 04:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
bite at the Apple so so my
 
04:27:39.830 --> 04:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
position on this would be that we remove
 
04:27:43.969 --> 04:27:43.979 align:start position:0%
section 222 and we stopped before taking
 
04:27:46.429 --> 04:27:46.439 align:start position:0%
a stravo to see if he'd want to vote
 
04:27:49.010 --> 04:27:49.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:52.309 --> 04:27:52.319 align:start position:0%
boat to remove well I haven't posed a
 
04:27:54.349 --> 04:27:54.359 align:start position:0%
question yet so so do you feel
 
04:27:56.689 --> 04:27:56.699 align:start position:0%
comfortable of voting with us or voting
 
04:27:59.990 --> 04:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
on this issue rather I do okay
 
04:28:01.910 --> 04:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
04:28:04.010 --> 04:28:04.020 align:start position:0%
um so I think the the straw vote and for
 
04:28:07.010 --> 04:28:07.020 align:start position:0%
and again what we've done sir is anybody
 
04:28:10.070 --> 04:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
can bring back anything on Monday if we
 
04:28:11.809 --> 04:28:11.819 align:start position:0%
want to come back and revisit it we're
 
04:28:13.429 --> 04:28:13.439 align:start position:0%
just trying to make some progress so
 
04:28:16.010 --> 04:28:16.020 align:start position:0%
that Mr Ripple has his uh boundaries
 
04:28:16.020 --> 04:28:17.389 align:start position:0%
that Mr Ripple has his uh boundaries
cleared

04:28:17.389 --> 04:28:17.399 align:start position:0%
cleared
 
04:28:21.649 --> 04:28:21.659 align:start position:0%
so the strong vote is do we vote to
 
04:28:25.429 --> 04:28:25.439 align:start position:0%
remove item 222 raising your hand yes is
 
04:28:28.250 --> 04:28:28.260 align:start position:0%
a remote to remove 222.
 
04:28:30.889 --> 04:28:30.899 align:start position:0%
raise your hand if you support removing
 
04:28:35.689 --> 04:28:35.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:38.750 --> 04:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
okay there's four if you oppose removing
 
04:28:42.349 --> 04:28:42.359 align:start position:0%
222 raise your hand
 
04:28:46.670 --> 04:28:46.680 align:start position:0%
okay so it re it remains all right
 
04:28:49.429 --> 04:28:49.439 align:start position:0%
at this point we may have another vote
 
04:28:51.469 --> 04:28:51.479 align:start position:0%
for you if you want to do another sununu
 
04:28:51.479 --> 04:28:53.570 align:start position:0%
for you if you want to do another sununu
vote

04:28:53.570 --> 04:28:53.580 align:start position:0%
vote
 
04:28:53.580 --> 04:28:55.130 align:start position:0%
vote
uh

04:28:55.130 --> 04:28:55.140 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:28:58.370 --> 04:28:58.380 align:start position:0%
so so that fails That Remains
 
04:29:02.450 --> 04:29:02.460 align:start position:0%
here I was all tied up in oplc oh I'm
 
04:29:04.670 --> 04:29:04.680 align:start position:0%
sorry that would be so much better
 
04:29:08.450 --> 04:29:08.460 align:start position:0%
okay that's most of hb2 didn't didn't we
 
04:29:10.010 --> 04:29:10.020 align:start position:0%
already vote on the first part of this
 
04:29:12.229 --> 04:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
we were already moving this to hp1 we
 
04:29:13.849 --> 04:29:13.859 align:start position:0%
already agreed on that we're deferring
 
04:29:20.210 --> 04:29:20.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:22.550 --> 04:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair go ahead just one other
 
04:29:24.050 --> 04:29:24.060 align:start position:0%
question for
 
04:29:25.670 --> 04:29:25.680 align:start position:0%
um director ripson if he's coming back
 
04:29:27.769 --> 04:29:27.779 align:start position:0%
Monday I assume he is would you please
 
04:29:30.290 --> 04:29:30.300 align:start position:0%
also bring information in addition to
 
04:29:33.110 --> 04:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
section 101 or class 101 I believe which
 
04:29:36.110 --> 04:29:36.120 align:start position:0%
is the Medicaid payments class 18 which
 
04:29:37.670 --> 04:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
is the overtime there's a million
 
04:29:39.530 --> 04:29:39.540 align:start position:0%
dollars in the biennium plan for
 
04:29:39.540 --> 04:29:43.189 align:start position:0%
dollars in the biennium plan for
overtime

04:29:43.189 --> 04:29:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:54.590 --> 04:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:54.600 --> 04:29:57.250 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:29:57.250 --> 04:29:57.260 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:30:03.550 --> 04:30:03.560 align:start position:0%
so we are on 224 DHS transfer Authority
 
04:30:07.490 --> 04:30:07.500 align:start position:0%
compliance with Federal standards
 
04:30:10.370 --> 04:30:10.380 align:start position:0%
Mr Ripple uh I have nothing to add other
 
04:30:12.050 --> 04:30:12.060 align:start position:0%
than this is a new section that hasn't
 
04:30:17.870 --> 04:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:20.510 --> 04:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
so Mr representative Weiler and
 
04:30:22.130 --> 04:30:22.140 align:start position:0%
representative Wallner with your
 
04:30:24.410 --> 04:30:24.420 align:start position:0%
experience on the fiscal committee this
 
04:30:27.649 --> 04:30:27.659 align:start position:0%
this feels to me like the effect of it
 
04:30:30.170 --> 04:30:30.180 align:start position:0%
is to bring fewer items to the fiscal
 
04:30:32.649 --> 04:30:32.659 align:start position:0%
committee committee to by granting more
 
04:30:35.929 --> 04:30:35.939 align:start position:0%
flexibility is is that a is that a fair
 
04:30:38.570 --> 04:30:38.580 align:start position:0%
statement Mr White will it will it have
 
04:30:40.610 --> 04:30:40.620 align:start position:0%
that effect
 
04:30:42.889 --> 04:30:42.899 align:start position:0%
this this would have that effect this is
 
04:30:44.990 --> 04:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
to address the sub-recipient contractor
 
04:30:47.389 --> 04:30:47.399 align:start position:0%
determinations that we've talked about a
 
04:30:49.490 --> 04:30:49.500 align:start position:0%
few times where when we receive federal
 
04:30:52.849 --> 04:30:52.859 align:start position:0%
funds under two CFR 200 331 we have to
 
04:30:55.790 --> 04:30:55.800 align:start position:0%
determine whether the funds will be used
 
04:30:57.889 --> 04:30:57.899 align:start position:0%
as a contractor as defined by federal
 
04:31:00.950 --> 04:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
regs or a sub-recipient and sometimes
 
04:31:02.870 --> 04:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
when we bring those requests forward to
 
04:31:04.969 --> 04:31:04.979 align:start position:0%
transfer between those it's because
 
04:31:06.590 --> 04:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
we've determined well originally we
 
04:31:07.969 --> 04:31:07.979 align:start position:0%
thought it was going to be this type of
 
04:31:10.189 --> 04:31:10.199 align:start position:0%
agreement now it's going to be this type
 
04:31:13.309 --> 04:31:13.319 align:start position:0%
of agreement where the a contractor may
 
04:31:15.110 --> 04:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
be providing services on behalf of the
 
04:31:16.490 --> 04:31:16.500 align:start position:0%
department instead of to the department
 
04:31:19.610 --> 04:31:19.620 align:start position:0%
and so those are the types of requests
 
04:31:22.309 --> 04:31:22.319 align:start position:0%
um that that this particular provision
 
04:31:24.229 --> 04:31:24.239 align:start position:0%
would address
 
04:31:26.630 --> 04:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
so in summary that sounds like it's just
 
04:31:29.630 --> 04:31:29.640 align:start position:0%
an execution detail deep into the
 
04:31:32.269 --> 04:31:32.279 align:start position:0%
process where it turns out to be one
 
04:31:34.250 --> 04:31:34.260 align:start position:0%
form of contract versus another we're
 
04:31:36.530 --> 04:31:36.540 align:start position:0%
not changing the intent of what we're
 
04:31:38.689 --> 04:31:38.699 align:start position:0%
trying to contract for or the dollar
 
04:31:41.889 --> 04:31:41.899 align:start position:0%
amount it's just granting some
 
04:31:45.110 --> 04:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
flexibility late into the process of
 
04:31:47.990 --> 04:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
Contracting it it the reason that we
 
04:31:50.090 --> 04:31:50.100 align:start position:0%
have that we that we want to transfer
 
04:31:52.670 --> 04:31:52.680 align:start position:0%
from 74 or 102 when we're doing this is
 
04:31:54.050 --> 04:31:54.060 align:start position:0%
because we want to make sure on the
 
04:31:56.149 --> 04:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
federal reporting side that things are
 
04:31:58.130 --> 04:31:58.140 align:start position:0%
accurate because when we get audited
 
04:32:00.590 --> 04:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
they look at our sub-recipients and if
 
04:32:03.469 --> 04:32:03.479 align:start position:0%
things are classified in incorrectly we
 
04:32:05.090 --> 04:32:05.100 align:start position:0%
can have an audit finding resulting from
 
04:32:09.050 --> 04:32:09.060 align:start position:0%
that so so what value does going through
 
04:32:12.050 --> 04:32:12.060 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee for that add what
 
04:32:14.570 --> 04:32:14.580 align:start position:0%
what is the value add of going back to
 
04:32:16.969 --> 04:32:16.979 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee
 
04:32:16.979 --> 04:32:19.849 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee
um

04:32:19.849 --> 04:32:19.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:23.330 --> 04:32:23.340 align:start position:0%
I'll save you uh okay representative
 
04:32:26.330 --> 04:32:26.340 align:start position:0%
walner or representative Weiler doesn't
 
04:32:28.250 --> 04:32:28.260 align:start position:0%
feel to me like we add much value with
 
04:32:30.349 --> 04:32:30.359 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee at that point
 
04:32:32.630 --> 04:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
so that makes me think we should we can
 
04:32:36.110 --> 04:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:37.610 --> 04:32:37.620 align:start position:0%
I agree
 
04:32:41.929 --> 04:32:41.939 align:start position:0%
I'm fine okay all right so
 
04:32:45.710 --> 04:32:45.720 align:start position:0%
um is anyone opposed to retaining
 
04:32:49.670 --> 04:32:49.680 align:start position:0%
um what section am I on two two four
 
04:32:51.710 --> 04:32:51.720 align:start position:0%
not seeing any opposition raise your
 
04:32:55.070 --> 04:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:57.410 --> 04:32:57.420 align:start position:0%
uh raise your hand well no it's a
 
04:33:00.229 --> 04:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
unanimous thank you
 
04:33:04.670 --> 04:33:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:04.680 --> 04:33:07.131 align:start position:0%
 
225.

04:33:07.131 --> 04:33:07.141 align:start position:0%
225.
 
04:33:10.070 --> 04:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
225 which moves from HHS to safety the
 
04:33:11.631 --> 04:33:11.641 align:start position:0%
responsibility to conduct preliminary
 
04:33:13.310 --> 04:33:13.320 align:start position:0%
inspection and approval for facilities
 
04:33:27.670 --> 04:33:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:30.949 --> 04:33:30.959 align:start position:0%
okay so there's basically two issues in
 
04:33:33.849 --> 04:33:33.859 align:start position:0%
this that are sort of policy related one
 
04:33:38.449 --> 04:33:38.459 align:start position:0%
is which is the correct agency in the
 
04:33:43.010 --> 04:33:43.020 align:start position:0%
state to do facility licensing
 
04:33:45.289 --> 04:33:45.299 align:start position:0%
and then the other is just the financial
 
04:33:47.990 --> 04:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
transfer to support that policy decision
 
04:33:50.390 --> 04:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
right is that fair
 
04:33:55.849 --> 04:33:55.859 align:start position:0%
Mr Ripple so is I think it is okay so
 
04:33:58.789 --> 04:33:58.799 align:start position:0%
so this is the department trying to give
 
04:34:02.510 --> 04:34:02.520 align:start position:0%
up Health Care Facility licensing to the
 
04:34:07.429 --> 04:34:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:07.439 --> 04:34:08.750 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:34:08.750 --> 04:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:34:11.269 --> 04:34:11.279 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
04:34:13.609 --> 04:34:13.619 align:start position:0%
typically Empire Building goes the other
 
04:34:15.650 --> 04:34:15.660 align:start position:0%
way so I'm prone to think that this is
 
04:34:15.660 --> 04:34:16.789 align:start position:0%
way so I'm prone to think that this is
okay

04:34:16.789 --> 04:34:16.799 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:34:19.090 --> 04:34:19.100 align:start position:0%
any anyone
 
04:34:23.029 --> 04:34:23.039 align:start position:0%
opposed I have a note that this is
 
04:34:27.349 --> 04:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
related to section 151 which reads about
 
04:34:31.131 --> 04:34:31.141 align:start position:0%
the same and I had that crossed out
 
04:34:35.869 --> 04:34:35.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:38.510 --> 04:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
go ahead Miss Ripley well 151 was the
 
04:34:40.189 --> 04:34:40.199 align:start position:0%
section that division three gave to
 
04:34:41.689 --> 04:34:41.699 align:start position:0%
division two and I believe they've
 
04:34:44.029 --> 04:34:44.039 align:start position:0%
already addressed and I'm not sure these
 
04:34:46.429 --> 04:34:46.439 align:start position:0%
two sections actually are related
 
04:34:46.439 --> 04:34:51.070 align:start position:0%
two sections actually are related
foreign

04:34:51.070 --> 04:34:51.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:53.750 --> 04:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
talks about who makes the inspection the
 
04:34:55.609 --> 04:34:55.619 align:start position:0%
other talks about there will be an
 
04:34:57.310 --> 04:34:57.320 align:start position:0%
annual inspection
 
04:34:59.929 --> 04:34:59.939 align:start position:0%
and I and I'll be honest I don't
 
04:35:03.170 --> 04:35:03.180 align:start position:0%
understand I don't know why 151 differs
 
04:35:05.510 --> 04:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
but I've I've been told by everyone that
 
04:35:07.010 --> 04:35:07.020 align:start position:0%
it does so maybe Nathan can speak about
 
04:35:10.010 --> 04:35:10.020 align:start position:0%
that a little more detail sure so just
 
04:35:11.390 --> 04:35:11.400 align:start position:0%
to give it a little bit of History here
 
04:35:13.369 --> 04:35:13.379 align:start position:0%
so the department of safety and the
 
04:35:14.449 --> 04:35:14.459 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
04:35:16.551 --> 04:35:16.561 align:start position:0%
had a number of conversations this past
 
04:35:18.230 --> 04:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
fall and summer
 
04:35:21.470 --> 04:35:21.480 align:start position:0%
um HHS has had a hard time filling uh
 
04:35:23.209 --> 04:35:23.219 align:start position:0%
two positions that are associated with
 
04:35:26.269 --> 04:35:26.279 align:start position:0%
this in the agency budget submission we
 
04:35:30.051 --> 04:35:30.061 align:start position:0%
abolish those two positions we we
 
04:35:32.209 --> 04:35:32.219 align:start position:0%
decrease our general fund amount by
 
04:35:34.449 --> 04:35:34.459 align:start position:0%
approximately 238 thousand
 
04:35:37.189 --> 04:35:37.199 align:start position:0%
safety increased their general fund
 
04:35:39.769 --> 04:35:39.779 align:start position:0%
amount by that equivalent amount created
 
04:35:43.010 --> 04:35:43.020 align:start position:0%
those two positions and the reason why
 
04:35:45.470 --> 04:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
is because this actually the the
 
04:35:47.810 --> 04:35:47.820 align:start position:0%
functions actually fall much more within
 
04:35:49.970 --> 04:35:49.980 align:start position:0%
their day-to-day purview and we have
 
04:35:52.189 --> 04:35:52.199 align:start position:0%
been unable to hire positions to do this
 
04:35:54.830 --> 04:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
for I think well over a year we've had
 
04:35:56.390 --> 04:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
to go out to contract and pay a
 
04:35:58.250 --> 04:35:58.260 align:start position:0%
significantly higher amount than it
 
04:36:00.230 --> 04:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
would actually cost for these positions
 
04:36:02.090 --> 04:36:02.100 align:start position:0%
to do this work
 
04:36:03.590 --> 04:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
um and so that's just a little bit of
 
04:36:05.810 --> 04:36:05.820 align:start position:0%
the back story behind this particular
 
04:36:09.170 --> 04:36:09.180 align:start position:0%
provision here the provision that that
 
04:36:11.570 --> 04:36:11.580 align:start position:0%
was referenced earlier I'm not quite
 
04:36:13.849 --> 04:36:13.859 align:start position:0%
sure where that came from and I did
 
04:36:15.650 --> 04:36:15.660 align:start position:0%
speak with the Department of Safety and
 
04:36:17.390 --> 04:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
they they didn't know why that was there
 
04:36:19.131 --> 04:36:19.141 align:start position:0%
either and I believe division two has
 
04:36:24.769 --> 04:36:24.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:27.230 --> 04:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
okay I'm not seeing any other comments
 
04:36:30.529 --> 04:36:30.539 align:start position:0%
uh I'd like to have us do a straw vote
 
04:36:33.830 --> 04:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
on retaining two two five
 
04:36:35.510 --> 04:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
do you have something you want to say
 
04:36:35.520 --> 04:36:37.429 align:start position:0%
do you have something you want to say
representable

04:36:37.429 --> 04:36:37.439 align:start position:0%
representable
 
04:36:40.189 --> 04:36:40.199 align:start position:0%
I do I just read this and it has to do
 
04:36:42.529 --> 04:36:42.539 align:start position:0%
with life safety Fire Marshal safety
 
04:36:45.289 --> 04:36:45.299 align:start position:0%
right type codes which are typically not
 
04:36:45.299 --> 04:36:46.429 align:start position:0%
right type codes which are typically not
done

04:36:46.429 --> 04:36:46.439 align:start position:0%
done
 
04:36:48.590 --> 04:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
by people other than the fire department
 
04:36:50.869 --> 04:36:50.879 align:start position:0%
so I could understand why moving this
 
04:36:52.551 --> 04:36:52.561 align:start position:0%
makes sense
 
04:36:56.330 --> 04:36:56.340 align:start position:0%
all right so raise your hand if you
 
04:36:59.390 --> 04:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
believe that we should retain 225 and
 
04:37:02.029 --> 04:37:02.039 align:start position:0%
hb2 as written
 
04:37:05.990 --> 04:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
that's unanimous thank you
 
04:37:06.000 --> 04:37:09.590 align:start position:0%
that's unanimous thank you
22226

04:37:09.590 --> 04:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:13.010 --> 04:37:13.020 align:start position:0%
um oh do you have you have an amendment
 
04:37:14.510 --> 04:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
on this yes
 
04:37:16.849 --> 04:37:16.859 align:start position:0%
okay let's hang on to that don't don't
 
04:37:19.551 --> 04:37:19.561 align:start position:0%
let me end the day without coming back
 
04:37:20.750 --> 04:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
to that
 
04:37:24.349 --> 04:37:24.359 align:start position:0%
um but uh but I I'm sort of enjoying the
 
04:37:28.490 --> 04:37:28.500 align:start position:0%
feeling of progress Mr chair yes well I
 
04:37:30.769 --> 04:37:30.779 align:start position:0%
hate to disrupt your feeling of uh
 
04:37:32.090 --> 04:37:32.100 align:start position:0%
whatever it is you're feeling you're the
 
04:37:34.131 --> 04:37:34.141 align:start position:0%
one that wanted me to go faster I know
 
04:37:36.650 --> 04:37:36.660 align:start position:0%
but I have to leave I have a hard stop
 
04:37:38.869 --> 04:37:38.879 align:start position:0%
at about 425 so I'd rather not leave
 
04:37:40.789 --> 04:37:40.799 align:start position:0%
this until the end of the day because
 
04:37:42.230 --> 04:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
you and I have a difference of opinion
 
04:37:43.369 --> 04:37:43.379 align:start position:0%
on this one
 
04:37:45.769 --> 04:37:45.779 align:start position:0%
so I'll wait for you to leave thanks for
 
04:37:47.170 --> 04:37:47.180 align:start position:0%
letting me know
 
04:37:50.029 --> 04:37:50.039 align:start position:0%
fair enough
 
04:37:53.090 --> 04:37:53.100 align:start position:0%
uh all right let's go ahead and break
 
04:38:04.131 --> 04:38:04.141 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:08.330 --> 04:38:08.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:10.429 --> 04:38:10.439 align:start position:0%
okay you might want to put both of them
 
04:38:13.429 --> 04:38:13.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:25.789 --> 04:38:25.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:28.910 --> 04:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
so let's let's discuss uh representative
 
04:38:32.449 --> 04:38:32.459 align:start position:0%
uh Amendment first it'll be nice to see
 
04:38:32.459 --> 04:38:33.410 align:start position:0%
uh Amendment first it'll be nice to see
it

04:38:33.410 --> 04:38:33.420 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:38:35.029 --> 04:38:35.039 align:start position:0%
you don't even need to see it
 
04:38:37.310 --> 04:38:37.320 align:start position:0%
representative says just simply strike
 
04:38:40.490 --> 04:38:40.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:41.810 --> 04:38:41.820 align:start position:0%
if you'd like
 
04:38:44.689 --> 04:38:44.699 align:start position:0%
background as to why I'd be happy to
 
04:38:46.551 --> 04:38:46.561 align:start position:0%
provide that
 
04:38:49.010 --> 04:38:49.020 align:start position:0%
I'd like to hear it
 
04:38:53.631 --> 04:38:53.641 align:start position:0%
so this is essentially taking out a law
 
04:38:59.090 --> 04:38:59.100 align:start position:0%
that we passed last year after a a lot
 
04:39:00.470 --> 04:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
of discussion
 
04:39:00.480 --> 04:39:02.689 align:start position:0%
of discussion
and

04:39:02.689 --> 04:39:02.699 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:39:05.029 --> 04:39:05.039 align:start position:0%
apparently there's concerned on the
 
04:39:06.830 --> 04:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
parts of the state that there's some
 
04:39:08.810 --> 04:39:08.820 align:start position:0%
costs associated with this I don't
 
04:39:10.490 --> 04:39:10.500 align:start position:0%
believe that's the case
 
04:39:12.769 --> 04:39:12.779 align:start position:0%
uh and I think if we just take this out
 
04:39:14.990 --> 04:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
they can deal with it and if they don't
 
04:39:16.070 --> 04:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
want to deal with it they don't have to
 
04:39:17.449 --> 04:39:17.459 align:start position:0%
deal with it it's a completely voluntary
 
04:39:21.109 --> 04:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
program on everybody's part uh the the
 
04:39:23.869 --> 04:39:23.879 align:start position:0%
uh the nurses and the hospitals wanted
 
04:39:25.789 --> 04:39:25.799 align:start position:0%
the cover of the state
 
04:39:27.769 --> 04:39:27.779 align:start position:0%
um as I recall and the nurses so the
 
04:39:30.051 --> 04:39:30.061 align:start position:0%
program is basically concerned with
 
04:39:32.150 --> 04:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
violence against particularly nurses but
 
04:39:34.250 --> 04:39:34.260 align:start position:0%
in general in the medical system and
 
04:39:35.390 --> 04:39:35.400 align:start position:0%
generally speaking we're talking about
 
04:39:38.030 --> 04:39:38.040 align:start position:0%
clients or patients whacking their nurse
 
04:39:39.708 --> 04:39:39.718 align:start position:0%
or something of that nature so the
 
04:39:41.390 --> 04:39:41.400 align:start position:0%
nurses would like to see this data
 
04:39:43.490 --> 04:39:43.500 align:start position:0%
collected so I presume so they can make
 
04:39:45.170 --> 04:39:45.180 align:start position:0%
a case say Hey listen you guys the
 
04:39:46.490 --> 04:39:46.500 align:start position:0%
hospital have to do something about this
 
04:39:47.690 --> 04:39:47.700 align:start position:0%
you know where your employees are
 
04:39:49.850 --> 04:39:49.860 align:start position:0%
getting hurt and you know we on the one
 
04:39:52.190 --> 04:39:52.200 align:start position:0%
hand we don't want to call out the
 
04:39:53.390 --> 04:39:53.400 align:start position:0%
patients because we understand that you
 
04:39:55.670 --> 04:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
know they're in distress as well but we
 
04:39:57.230 --> 04:39:57.240 align:start position:0%
need to deal with the problem of the
 
04:39:58.910 --> 04:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
violence and the best way to deal with
 
04:40:00.708 --> 04:40:00.718 align:start position:0%
it is to first of all get the stats so
 
04:40:04.310 --> 04:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
that they can be collated so that's all
 
04:40:05.690 --> 04:40:05.700 align:start position:0%
in the bill and representative Edwards
 
04:40:07.670 --> 04:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
worked really hard on that bill
 
04:40:10.490 --> 04:40:10.500 align:start position:0%
um that's the current one and I think
 
04:40:12.770 --> 04:40:12.780 align:start position:0%
that just taking this provision out and
 
04:40:15.708 --> 04:40:15.718 align:start position:0%
the state will figure it out thanks okay
 
04:40:18.530 --> 04:40:18.540 align:start position:0%
so where do we agree we agree that this
 
04:40:20.690 --> 04:40:20.700 align:start position:0%
is an important program that's being
 
04:40:23.690 --> 04:40:23.700 align:start position:0%
advocated for by the hospitals and by
 
04:40:25.970 --> 04:40:25.980 align:start position:0%
the health care providers that work
 
04:40:27.310 --> 04:40:27.320 align:start position:0%
within the
 
04:40:30.890 --> 04:40:30.900 align:start position:0%
system and
 
04:40:30.900 --> 04:40:32.868 align:start position:0%
system and
um

04:40:32.868 --> 04:40:32.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:36.010 --> 04:40:36.020 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
04:40:38.810 --> 04:40:38.820 align:start position:0%
so we agree we agree that this program
 
04:40:41.270 --> 04:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
should get started we should that's
 
04:40:43.910 --> 04:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
where we're in complete agreement the
 
04:40:47.270 --> 04:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
the I think a distinction is that I
 
04:40:49.430 --> 04:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
actually believe the department when
 
04:40:52.130 --> 04:40:52.140 align:start position:0%
they say they don't have the manpower to
 
04:40:53.868 --> 04:40:53.878 align:start position:0%
meet their obligations under current
 
04:40:56.990 --> 04:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
statute and the department came to us
 
04:41:01.368 --> 04:41:01.378 align:start position:0%
with this hb2 asking for a suspension
 
04:41:05.630 --> 04:41:05.640 align:start position:0%
and their obligations under the law
 
04:41:10.310 --> 04:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
so rather than do the suspension exactly
 
04:41:12.410 --> 04:41:12.420 align:start position:0%
like the department has asked us to
 
04:41:15.190 --> 04:41:15.200 align:start position:0%
because I believe them
 
04:41:15.200 --> 04:41:17.030 align:start position:0%
because I believe them
I

04:41:17.030 --> 04:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:41:19.610 --> 04:41:19.620 align:start position:0%
also want to pay attention to the
 
04:41:21.530 --> 04:41:21.540 align:start position:0%
constituent groups that say that this
 
04:41:23.570 --> 04:41:23.580 align:start position:0%
program is important to them
 
04:41:27.410 --> 04:41:27.420 align:start position:0%
so in order to have these two realities
 
04:41:31.510 --> 04:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
exist with one another my bill
 
04:41:35.510 --> 04:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
suspends or is meant to suspend the
 
04:41:39.830 --> 04:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
obligations of the state employees to
 
04:41:42.650 --> 04:41:42.660 align:start position:0%
participate in the program while keeping
 
04:41:45.770 --> 04:41:45.780 align:start position:0%
the program in place so that the private
 
04:41:49.970 --> 04:41:49.980 align:start position:0%
sector can take the law as written and
 
04:41:51.948 --> 04:41:51.958 align:start position:0%
go ahead and do all the things that they
 
04:41:55.128 --> 04:41:55.138 align:start position:0%
need to do in order to set up kind of
 
04:41:57.010 --> 04:41:57.020 align:start position:0%
this Statewide
 
04:42:00.770 --> 04:42:00.780 align:start position:0%
workplace violence Commission in that
 
04:42:03.410 --> 04:42:03.420 align:start position:0%
commission they basically ask that
 
04:42:05.990 --> 04:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
everybody in a hospital and everyone in
 
04:42:09.170 --> 04:42:09.180 align:start position:0%
sort of the three major clinics sit on
 
04:42:11.990 --> 04:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
this on this commission it also brings
 
04:42:16.250 --> 04:42:16.260 align:start position:0%
in the like the commissioner of DHHS or
 
04:42:20.868 --> 04:42:20.878 align:start position:0%
her designee the AG or designee the
 
04:42:23.510 --> 04:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
labor department or designee
 
04:42:26.930 --> 04:42:26.940 align:start position:0%
and uh so there so there's active
 
04:42:29.750 --> 04:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
participation by state employees on the
 
04:42:32.770 --> 04:42:32.780 align:start position:0%
commission that my bill would suspend
 
04:42:35.570 --> 04:42:35.580 align:start position:0%
unless they can voluntarily support it
 
04:42:38.150 --> 04:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
it would also suspend a simple
 
04:42:42.948 --> 04:42:42.958 align:start position:0%
obligation to establish a website that
 
04:42:45.770 --> 04:42:45.780 align:start position:0%
takes some very minimalistic data from
 
04:42:48.910 --> 04:42:48.920 align:start position:0%
the commission and to have it published
 
04:42:54.050 --> 04:42:54.060 align:start position:0%
it also suspends their obligation to
 
04:42:58.070 --> 04:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
work on the privacy and confidentiality
 
04:43:01.030 --> 04:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
the privileged Communications
 
04:43:03.410 --> 04:43:03.420 align:start position:0%
protections that we give this commission
 
04:43:06.550 --> 04:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
it it it suspends the Department's
 
04:43:09.770 --> 04:43:09.780 align:start position:0%
obligation to work that through gel car
 
04:43:12.350 --> 04:43:12.360 align:start position:0%
so the Department's position as I
 
04:43:14.208 --> 04:43:14.218 align:start position:0%
understand it has been very strong that
 
04:43:16.730 --> 04:43:16.740 align:start position:0%
there are Manpower obligations here that
 
04:43:19.070 --> 04:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
they just don't have time for at this
 
04:43:23.030 --> 04:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
point and I believe them so so rather
 
04:43:25.610 --> 04:43:25.620 align:start position:0%
than doing what the department said and
 
04:43:28.430 --> 04:43:28.440 align:start position:0%
so just suspend the program I said no
 
04:43:30.890 --> 04:43:30.900 align:start position:0%
let's find Middle Ground let's let's
 
04:43:33.050 --> 04:43:33.060 align:start position:0%
suspend the obligations of the state
 
04:43:35.690 --> 04:43:35.700 align:start position:0%
although you can still voluntarily do
 
04:43:39.050 --> 04:43:39.060 align:start position:0%
what you are able to do but fully leave
 
04:43:41.150 --> 04:43:41.160 align:start position:0%
the law in place so that the private
 
04:43:43.788 --> 04:43:43.798 align:start position:0%
sector can get their own act together
 
04:43:45.708 --> 04:43:45.718 align:start position:0%
I've always thought that the private
 
04:43:47.990 --> 04:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
sector doesn't need to State anyways I
 
04:43:49.610 --> 04:43:49.620 align:start position:0%
think they can make a tremendous amount
 
04:43:52.910 --> 04:43:52.920 align:start position:0%
of progress without the state but but
 
04:43:56.208 --> 04:43:56.218 align:start position:0%
for some reason they have really been
 
04:44:00.050 --> 04:44:00.060 align:start position:0%
insistent on having you know kind of the
 
04:44:02.628 --> 04:44:02.638 align:start position:0%
training wheels of the state attached to
 
04:44:05.510 --> 04:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
this vehicle that they're trying to to
 
04:44:08.330 --> 04:44:08.340 align:start position:0%
build go ahead represent the Earth
 
04:44:11.448 --> 04:44:11.458 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so a couple things on
 
04:44:11.458 --> 04:44:12.350 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so a couple things on
line

04:44:12.350 --> 04:44:12.360 align:start position:0%
line
 
04:44:15.288 --> 04:44:15.298 align:start position:0%
11 the website if I'm not mistaken it
 
04:44:17.570 --> 04:44:17.580 align:start position:0%
was the chairman who asked that that be
 
04:44:20.030 --> 04:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
put into the law they have no problem
 
04:44:22.970 --> 04:44:22.980 align:start position:0%
with that being limited nor do I but I
 
04:44:25.490 --> 04:44:25.500 align:start position:0%
do understand this is my understanding I
 
04:44:27.590 --> 04:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
should say that what's on line 10 the
 
04:44:29.030 --> 04:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
jellicotta stuff that that is
 
04:44:32.350 --> 04:44:32.360 align:start position:0%
particularly important to them and I've
 
04:44:35.750 --> 04:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
like the the chairman when we had this
 
04:44:37.250 --> 04:44:37.260 align:start position:0%
whole discussion several years ago last
 
04:44:37.260 --> 04:44:38.208 align:start position:0%
whole discussion several years ago last
year

04:44:38.208 --> 04:44:38.218 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:44:39.350 --> 04:44:39.360 align:start position:0%
um it did seem like the whole thing
 
04:44:40.850 --> 04:44:40.860 align:start position:0%
could be voluntary
 
04:44:43.670 --> 04:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
to me and to the chairman but it was
 
04:44:45.830 --> 04:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
pretty clear that the people on the
 
04:44:47.930 --> 04:44:47.940 align:start position:0%
other side didn't feel that way which is
 
04:44:51.110 --> 04:44:51.120 align:start position:0%
why we went ahead and put this forward
 
04:44:52.910 --> 04:44:52.920 align:start position:0%
um I didn't the AG doesn't have to show
 
04:44:54.350 --> 04:44:54.360 align:start position:0%
up and people don't have to show up
 
04:44:56.330 --> 04:44:56.340 align:start position:0%
there's no like there's no penalty for
 
04:44:58.190 --> 04:44:58.200 align:start position:0%
any of these people not showing up at a
 
04:45:00.170 --> 04:45:00.180 align:start position:0%
meeting they're all voluntary the only
 
04:45:01.850 --> 04:45:01.860 align:start position:0%
thing that they really need the as I
 
04:45:03.350 --> 04:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
understand especially from the nurses
 
04:45:05.330 --> 04:45:05.340 align:start position:0%
the only thing they really care about is
 
04:45:07.730 --> 04:45:07.740 align:start position:0%
the jail car part which protects the
 
04:45:09.590 --> 04:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
confidentiality also as I understand it
 
04:45:11.090 --> 04:45:11.100 align:start position:0%
that they don't feel they can do that
 
04:45:13.190 --> 04:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
without the state but to ditch the
 
04:45:15.530 --> 04:45:15.540 align:start position:0%
website that's fine as I say the folks
 
04:45:17.868 --> 04:45:17.878 align:start position:0%
showing up that's all voluntary anyway I
 
04:45:19.550 --> 04:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
don't really believe they have any
 
04:45:19.560 --> 04:45:20.570 align:start position:0%
don't really believe they have any
serious

04:45:20.570 --> 04:45:20.580 align:start position:0%
serious
 
04:45:22.490 --> 04:45:22.500 align:start position:0%
and as far as keeping track of the
 
04:45:24.470 --> 04:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
databases that can be on the nurses and
 
04:45:26.750 --> 04:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
the hospitals as well there's no
 
04:45:29.150 --> 04:45:29.160 align:start position:0%
requirement that the state take it take
 
04:45:31.910 --> 04:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
they take responsibility for that
 
04:45:34.070 --> 04:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
so the reason there are no penalties for
 
04:45:35.510 --> 04:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
not participating is because I
 
04:45:37.490 --> 04:45:37.500 align:start position:0%
explicitly removed them
 
04:45:40.270 --> 04:45:40.280 align:start position:0%
so they wanted to be able to penalize
 
04:45:42.970 --> 04:45:42.980 align:start position:0%
non-participation and that's that's gone
 
04:45:47.628 --> 04:45:47.638 align:start position:0%
uh and and so uh so you and I are
 
04:45:49.550 --> 04:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
getting to the same place in two
 
04:45:50.868 --> 04:45:50.878 align:start position:0%
different ways when we're talking about
 
04:45:54.708 --> 04:45:54.718 align:start position:0%
participation what what what mine says
 
04:45:57.470 --> 04:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
instead of you deleting it and leaving
 
04:46:00.110 --> 04:46:00.120 align:start position:0%
the statute in effects directing the AG
 
04:46:04.310 --> 04:46:04.320 align:start position:0%
to a point uh a member mine simply
 
04:46:05.990 --> 04:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
suspends it and says if you can do it
 
04:46:09.230 --> 04:46:09.240 align:start position:0%
voluntarily go ahead in my discussions
 
04:46:12.708 --> 04:46:12.718 align:start position:0%
with the nursing association explaining
 
04:46:15.288 --> 04:46:15.298 align:start position:0%
to them what I'd be willing to do there
 
04:46:17.750 --> 04:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
wasn't violent pushback I quit talking
 
04:46:20.090 --> 04:46:20.100 align:start position:0%
to the hospital Association when I had
 
04:46:22.010 --> 04:46:22.020 align:start position:0%
my Integrity attacked so I don't know if
 
04:46:24.670 --> 04:46:24.680 align:start position:0%
she's continued to attack talk to you
 
04:46:28.970 --> 04:46:28.980 align:start position:0%
but uh I I I have always taken the
 
04:46:31.788 --> 04:46:31.798 align:start position:0%
position on this that this is a great
 
04:46:35.690 --> 04:46:35.700 align:start position:0%
private sector initiative and their
 
04:46:39.110 --> 04:46:39.120 align:start position:0%
obsession with having the state involved
 
04:46:41.930 --> 04:46:41.940 align:start position:0%
is more than it needs to be to your
 
04:46:44.330 --> 04:46:44.340 align:start position:0%
point about the gel car that is a
 
04:46:47.030 --> 04:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
particularly time consuming thing for
 
04:46:49.730 --> 04:46:49.740 align:start position:0%
which I think the commissioner said they
 
04:46:52.690 --> 04:46:52.700 align:start position:0%
don't have the bandwidth to do that
 
04:46:56.390 --> 04:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
and the privileged communication the
 
04:46:59.270 --> 04:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
privacy of that we can do that in law
 
04:47:01.190 --> 04:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
they don't need to do that in jail car
 
04:47:04.010 --> 04:47:04.020 align:start position:0%
so there's still a way to make sure that
 
04:47:06.770 --> 04:47:06.780 align:start position:0%
the confidentiality is protected but you
 
04:47:08.930 --> 04:47:08.940 align:start position:0%
know what what these guys need to do
 
04:47:11.090 --> 04:47:11.100 align:start position:0%
first is they need to get together and
 
04:47:12.830 --> 04:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
figure out what their procedures are
 
04:47:15.288 --> 04:47:15.298 align:start position:0%
because we don't know exactly what needs
 
04:47:17.090 --> 04:47:17.100 align:start position:0%
to be protected and privileged until
 
04:47:19.070 --> 04:47:19.080 align:start position:0%
they can come back to us and say this is
 
04:47:21.350 --> 04:47:21.360 align:start position:0%
how we would actually run the the
 
04:47:24.708 --> 04:47:24.718 align:start position:0%
management of the Phi so
 
04:47:28.250 --> 04:47:28.260 align:start position:0%
um so I I think our amendments try to
 
04:47:31.310 --> 04:47:31.320 align:start position:0%
get to the same point but but mine
 
04:47:34.610 --> 04:47:34.620 align:start position:0%
basically gives the discretion to get
 
04:47:37.788 --> 04:47:37.798 align:start position:0%
involved in the part of the state and
 
04:47:40.850 --> 04:47:40.860 align:start position:0%
yours leaves the compulsory part of the
 
04:47:42.948 --> 04:47:42.958 align:start position:0%
law in place to where we must
 
04:47:46.368 --> 04:47:46.378 align:start position:0%
participate and and that's where I think
 
04:47:48.350 --> 04:47:48.360 align:start position:0%
I see the disagreement between the two
 
04:47:48.360 --> 04:47:50.750 align:start position:0%
I see the disagreement between the two
approaches

04:47:50.750 --> 04:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
approaches
 
04:47:50.760 --> 04:47:53.090 align:start position:0%
approaches
foreign

04:47:53.090 --> 04:47:53.100 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:47:55.910 --> 04:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
any other questions comments
 
04:47:58.368 --> 04:47:58.378 align:start position:0%
Mr White do you want to talk about the
 
04:48:00.530 --> 04:48:00.540 align:start position:0%
position of the department on on whether
 
04:48:03.650 --> 04:48:03.660 align:start position:0%
or not uh you you guys really think you
 
04:48:06.830 --> 04:48:06.840 align:start position:0%
need 226.
 
04:48:09.530 --> 04:48:09.540 align:start position:0%
I I I I don't think I
 
04:48:11.208 --> 04:48:11.218 align:start position:0%
um the department isn't opposed to any
 
04:48:12.890 --> 04:48:12.900 align:start position:0%
of this from a policy perspective I
 
04:48:15.708 --> 04:48:15.718 align:start position:0%
think it really comes down to resources
 
04:48:19.010 --> 04:48:19.020 align:start position:0%
um scp-459 from the 2022 legislative
 
04:48:21.410 --> 04:48:21.420 align:start position:0%
session it it's it's about six pages
 
04:48:22.490 --> 04:48:22.500 align:start position:0%
long and there are a number of
 
04:48:23.690 --> 04:48:23.700 align:start position:0%
requirements in there for the Department
 
04:48:26.270 --> 04:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
to collect analyze data conduct
 
04:48:27.708 --> 04:48:27.718 align:start position:0%
follow-ups anybody that's ever been
 
04:48:29.270 --> 04:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
through the administrative rules process
 
04:48:31.430 --> 04:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
which is required under that it can be
 
04:48:33.230 --> 04:48:33.240 align:start position:0%
it can be a six to ten month process
 
04:48:35.030 --> 04:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
that's pretty in-depth
 
04:48:37.610 --> 04:48:37.620 align:start position:0%
um and and there's a few other
 
04:48:39.770 --> 04:48:39.780 align:start position:0%
requirements there and so
 
04:48:41.330 --> 04:48:41.340 align:start position:0%
um we we just want to make sure that the
 
04:48:42.890 --> 04:48:42.900 align:start position:0%
department has the resources available
 
04:48:46.670 --> 04:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
to do this because we we don't have idle
 
04:48:48.650 --> 04:48:48.660 align:start position:0%
idle individuals standing around to to
 
04:48:51.470 --> 04:48:51.480 align:start position:0%
do this type of work today so so my
 
04:48:53.868 --> 04:48:53.878 align:start position:0%
Amendment would be to be clear doesn't
 
04:48:57.948 --> 04:48:57.958 align:start position:0%
say you can't do the gel car procedures
 
04:49:00.470 --> 04:49:00.480 align:start position:0%
you can't do I'm not prohibiting
 
04:49:02.330 --> 04:49:02.340 align:start position:0%
anything this is kind of enabling
 
04:49:04.788 --> 04:49:04.798 align:start position:0%
legislation to the extent that you have
 
04:49:07.550 --> 04:49:07.560 align:start position:0%
Manpower capacity to invest in this you
 
04:49:09.170 --> 04:49:09.180 align:start position:0%
certainly able to because the law
 
04:49:11.570 --> 04:49:11.580 align:start position:0%
remains in effect
 
04:49:11.580 --> 04:49:14.030 align:start position:0%
remains in effect
so

04:49:14.030 --> 04:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:49:14.040 --> 04:49:14.990 align:start position:0%
so
um

04:49:14.990 --> 04:49:15.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:18.170 --> 04:49:18.180 align:start position:0%
so we have we have two amendments here
 
04:49:21.350 --> 04:49:21.360 align:start position:0%
uh I I guess I guess I'll do them in
 
04:49:24.410 --> 04:49:24.420 align:start position:0%
order uh if you are in favor of
 
04:49:27.230 --> 04:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
Representative erf's Amendment which
 
04:49:31.090 --> 04:49:31.100 align:start position:0%
deletes 226 and has the effect of
 
04:49:34.910 --> 04:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
leaving in effect the current statute on
 
04:49:36.650 --> 04:49:36.660 align:start position:0%
workplace violence please raise your
 
04:49:36.660 --> 04:49:40.150 align:start position:0%
workplace violence please raise your
hand

04:49:40.150 --> 04:49:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:42.230 --> 04:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
representative Morgan do you have a vote
 
04:49:43.970 --> 04:49:43.980 align:start position:0%
there no
 
04:49:47.208 --> 04:49:47.218 align:start position:0%
okay so what what was that count I
 
04:49:49.788 --> 04:49:49.798 align:start position:0%
didn't count it one two
 
04:49:49.798 --> 04:49:51.350 align:start position:0%
didn't count it one two
three four

04:49:51.350 --> 04:49:51.360 align:start position:0%
three four
 
04:49:53.270 --> 04:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
so don't vote if you're not sure don't
 
04:49:53.280 --> 04:49:54.230 align:start position:0%
so don't vote if you're not sure don't
vote

04:49:54.230 --> 04:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
vote
 
04:49:56.510 --> 04:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
this is a stravo you can vote Monday if
 
04:50:02.750 --> 04:50:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:02.760 --> 04:50:05.208 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:50:05.208 --> 04:50:05.218 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:50:07.610 --> 04:50:07.620 align:start position:0%
that's that's perfectly good that's it's
 
04:50:11.390 --> 04:50:11.400 align:start position:0%
better to to do that so
 
04:50:14.990 --> 04:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
um so if those who are opposed to the
 
04:50:21.530 --> 04:50:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:23.330 --> 04:50:23.340 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
04:50:26.868 --> 04:50:26.878 align:start position:0%
so the strong the straw vote says to to
 
04:50:29.510 --> 04:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
to not accept the Earth Amendment
 
04:50:32.810 --> 04:50:32.820 align:start position:0%
so the next stravo is whether or not you
 
04:50:35.390 --> 04:50:35.400 align:start position:0%
accept the Edwards Amendment which
 
04:50:38.650 --> 04:50:38.660 align:start position:0%
leaves the law in place but provides
 
04:50:42.590 --> 04:50:42.600 align:start position:0%
flexibility as Manpower is available to
 
04:50:45.170 --> 04:50:45.180 align:start position:0%
participate in the program as it becomes
 
04:50:46.868 --> 04:50:46.878 align:start position:0%
possible that's what this amendment does
 
04:50:51.430 --> 04:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
all those in favor of the amendment
 
04:50:58.128 --> 04:50:58.138 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:59.868 --> 04:50:59.878 align:start position:0%
did you raise your hand Representative
 
04:51:02.208 --> 04:51:02.218 align:start position:0%
walner no and with nordgren so that's
 
04:51:06.170 --> 04:51:06.180 align:start position:0%
five who who's opposed one
 
04:51:06.180 --> 04:51:08.810 align:start position:0%
five who who's opposed one
two

04:51:08.810 --> 04:51:08.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:11.090 --> 04:51:11.100 align:start position:0%
I would prefer to abstain before a vote
 
04:51:13.490 --> 04:51:13.500 align:start position:0%
to get to caucus with my ranking members
 
04:51:16.970 --> 04:51:16.980 align:start position:0%
to hear more so so at this point I think
 
04:51:19.490 --> 04:51:19.500 align:start position:0%
we're going forward with the Edwards hb2
 
04:51:19.500 --> 04:51:21.470 align:start position:0%
we're going forward with the Edwards hb2
item

04:51:21.470 --> 04:51:21.480 align:start position:0%
item
 
04:51:24.770 --> 04:51:24.780 align:start position:0%
but I suspect somebody will want to
 
04:51:31.610 --> 04:51:31.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:31.620 --> 04:51:35.510 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:51:35.510 --> 04:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:37.490 --> 04:51:37.500 align:start position:0%
is there anything else you'd like us to
 
04:51:39.530 --> 04:51:39.540 align:start position:0%
do representative before you leave for
 
04:51:41.930 --> 04:51:41.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:45.288 --> 04:51:45.298 align:start position:0%
I know but but we're we're moving at
 
04:51:48.050 --> 04:51:48.060 align:start position:0%
about four an hour so I just wanna
 
04:51:48.060 --> 04:51:53.288 align:start position:0%
about four an hour so I just wanna
okay

04:51:53.288 --> 04:51:53.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:57.470 --> 04:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
so the next section's 227 and 228
 
04:51:59.330 --> 04:51:59.340 align:start position:0%
I extend through the biennium the
 
04:52:00.830 --> 04:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
Department's ability to transfer between
 
04:52:02.990 --> 04:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
personal personnel class lines with
 
04:52:04.610 --> 04:52:04.620 align:start position:0%
prior approval of the fiscal committee
 
04:52:06.650 --> 04:52:06.660 align:start position:0%
uh this has appeared in four out of the
 
04:52:12.830 --> 04:52:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:15.050 --> 04:52:15.060 align:start position:0%
any any questions
 
04:52:17.510 --> 04:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
if there are no questions this is just
 
04:52:20.030 --> 04:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
more Department flexibility we've agreed
 
04:52:22.490 --> 04:52:22.500 align:start position:0%
to in the past so do we want to retain
 
04:52:28.010 --> 04:52:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:31.070 --> 04:52:31.080 align:start position:0%
if if no raise your hand
 
04:52:33.708 --> 04:52:33.718 align:start position:0%
okay so so we're going to keep that the
 
04:52:36.650 --> 04:52:36.660 align:start position:0%
next question is is this a topic that we
 
04:52:38.628 --> 04:52:38.638 align:start position:0%
might want to make permanent rather than
 
04:52:41.150 --> 04:52:41.160 align:start position:0%
bringing it Forward every two years do
 
04:52:42.650 --> 04:52:42.660 align:start position:0%
you have a point of view on that Mr
 
04:52:44.570 --> 04:52:44.580 align:start position:0%
Ripple is this a good candidate for to
 
04:52:46.850 --> 04:52:46.860 align:start position:0%
make permanent I have no point of view
 
04:52:51.470 --> 04:52:51.480 align:start position:0%
on that none okay so I I want less is
 
04:52:56.510 --> 04:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
more less hp2 the better so so I I would
 
04:52:59.208 --> 04:52:59.218 align:start position:0%
like a straw vote on whether or not you
 
04:53:02.628 --> 04:53:02.638 align:start position:0%
we want to make this permanent I will
 
04:53:05.270 --> 04:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
raise raise go ahead understanding is
 
04:53:06.770 --> 04:53:06.780 align:start position:0%
this is not true for some of the other
 
04:53:06.780 --> 04:53:10.190 align:start position:0%
this is not true for some of the other
departments

04:53:10.190 --> 04:53:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:13.788 --> 04:53:13.798 align:start position:0%
what it was be more specific what is not
 
04:53:15.590 --> 04:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
true for the other departments the
 
04:53:17.628 --> 04:53:17.638 align:start position:0%
department of safety for instance right
 
04:53:20.150 --> 04:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
does not does not necessarily have the
 
04:53:22.670 --> 04:53:22.680 align:start position:0%
authority to move between classes
 
04:53:28.430 --> 04:53:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:30.890 --> 04:53:30.900 align:start position:0%
well being a member of division three I
 
04:53:32.510 --> 04:53:32.520 align:start position:0%
think we're special
 
04:53:32.520 --> 04:53:34.128 align:start position:0%
think we're special
uh

04:53:34.128 --> 04:53:34.138 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:53:36.650 --> 04:53:36.660 align:start position:0%
but no you raised a good question is is
 
04:53:39.110 --> 04:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
you know Mr chair do you have any issues
 
04:53:41.090 --> 04:53:41.100 align:start position:0%
here that this that we're basically
 
04:53:43.610 --> 04:53:43.620 align:start position:0%
working on a Personnel policy that's
 
04:53:47.030 --> 04:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
unique to DHHS and not the whole state
 
04:53:50.510 --> 04:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
we've Mr Ripple has told us we've
 
04:53:53.270 --> 04:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
approved this several times in past
 
04:53:55.430 --> 04:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
budgets so
 
04:53:57.050 --> 04:53:57.060 align:start position:0%
so I can give you more information on
 
04:54:00.470 --> 04:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
that it was not approved in 2013 and it
 
04:54:03.110 --> 04:54:03.120 align:start position:0%
was not approved in 2017. you might
 
04:54:09.230 --> 04:54:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:11.390 --> 04:54:11.400 align:start position:0%
with those your budgets
 
04:54:17.230 --> 04:54:17.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:21.350 --> 04:54:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:23.570 --> 04:54:23.580 align:start position:0%
I guess I better be consistent then
 
04:54:25.970 --> 04:54:25.980 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:54:28.490 --> 04:54:28.500 align:start position:0%
the only reason I would leave it I yeah
 
04:54:31.310 --> 04:54:31.320 align:start position:0%
because I always agree with
 
04:54:31.320 --> 04:54:33.650 align:start position:0%
because I always agree with
you right

04:54:33.650 --> 04:54:33.660 align:start position:0%
you right
 
04:54:35.810 --> 04:54:35.820 align:start position:0%
can I poke you on that every time not
 
04:54:38.330 --> 04:54:38.340 align:start position:0%
not always not always
 
04:54:41.750 --> 04:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
okay no the only I think it is not a bad
 
04:54:43.670 --> 04:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
idea to have
 
04:54:46.850 --> 04:54:46.860 align:start position:0%
it in here because it reminds us when
 
04:54:49.970 --> 04:54:49.980 align:start position:0%
we're doing the budget that
 
04:54:49.980 --> 04:54:51.470 align:start position:0%
we're doing the budget that
that

04:54:51.470 --> 04:54:51.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:54:54.590 --> 04:54:54.600 align:start position:0%
is that's something that we're allowing
 
04:54:56.750 --> 04:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
them to do and
 
04:54:58.970 --> 04:54:58.980 align:start position:0%
if it's not here I don't know where it
 
04:55:01.670 --> 04:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
will be I mean I don't know how we how
 
04:55:06.770 --> 04:55:06.780 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:09.470 --> 04:55:09.480 align:start position:0%
I I I'm not going to argue with you
 
04:55:11.090 --> 04:55:11.100 align:start position:0%
because you've been doing this for 10
 
04:55:15.310 --> 04:55:15.320 align:start position:0%
years uh at least so I I would just say
 
04:55:20.030 --> 04:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
of the other 47 things that the Das can
 
04:55:22.250 --> 04:55:22.260 align:start position:0%
do in a Personnel area that we don't
 
04:55:24.890 --> 04:55:24.900 align:start position:0%
keep track of mentally all the time this
 
04:55:27.708 --> 04:55:27.718 align:start position:0%
is just fall into the back Waters of
 
04:55:30.230 --> 04:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
what flexibility they have from a
 
04:55:31.788 --> 04:55:31.798 align:start position:0%
Personnel perspective
 
04:55:35.448 --> 04:55:35.458 align:start position:0%
so I I I don't much care other than my
 
04:55:38.628 --> 04:55:38.638 align:start position:0%
obsession is Let's do let's do more by
 
04:55:40.670 --> 04:55:40.680 align:start position:0%
doing less if we can make this permanent
 
04:55:42.470 --> 04:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
without breaking anything let's just go
 
04:55:43.910 --> 04:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
ahead and make it permanent it's my
 
04:55:47.030 --> 04:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
point of view did but did we we haven't
 
04:55:51.230 --> 04:55:51.240 align:start position:0%
yet voted on just keeping the it as is
 
04:55:54.708 --> 04:55:54.718 align:start position:0%
we did what did we do
 
04:55:58.190 --> 04:55:58.200 align:start position:0%
six two seven six two six two okay yes
 
04:56:02.750 --> 04:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
so so I did what I crushed you
 
04:56:04.610 --> 04:56:04.620 align:start position:0%
for everyone out there
 
04:56:08.690 --> 04:56:08.700 align:start position:0%
that's now one to five this week
 
04:56:11.448 --> 04:56:11.458 align:start position:0%
um okay so now we're going to talk about
 
04:56:13.910 --> 04:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
whether or not we make this permanent
 
04:56:16.070 --> 04:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
if you want to make this permanent raise
 
04:56:19.430 --> 04:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:21.708 --> 04:56:21.718 align:start position:0%
okay if you want to not make it
 
04:56:23.690 --> 04:56:23.700 align:start position:0%
permanent raise your hand okay so it's
 
04:56:26.628 --> 04:56:26.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:30.190 --> 04:56:30.200 align:start position:0%
okay so two two nine
 
04:56:32.510 --> 04:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
establishment of certain unclassified
 
04:56:34.788 --> 04:56:34.798 align:start position:0%
positions in abolition of certain
 
04:56:37.550 --> 04:56:37.560 align:start position:0%
classified positions what are we doing
 
04:56:37.560 --> 04:56:42.470 align:start position:0%
classified positions what are we doing
here

04:56:42.470 --> 04:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:45.070 --> 04:56:45.080 align:start position:0%
I would let Nathan comment on that one
 
04:56:50.208 --> 04:56:50.218 align:start position:0%
sure so this section 229 this converts
 
04:56:52.610 --> 04:56:52.620 align:start position:0%
to positions um two pharmaceutical
 
04:56:53.750 --> 04:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
positions that we have in the division
 
04:56:57.650 --> 04:56:57.660 align:start position:0%
of Medicaid services from classified to
 
04:56:59.270 --> 04:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
unclassified the reason that we're
 
04:57:02.090 --> 04:57:02.100 align:start position:0%
making this request these positions have
 
04:57:04.128 --> 04:57:04.138 align:start position:0%
had enhancements I believe for close to
 
04:57:06.590 --> 04:57:06.600 align:start position:0%
a decade so salary enhancement that have
 
04:57:08.990 --> 04:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
been approved by GNC the division of
 
04:57:11.510 --> 04:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
personnel recommended that we convert
 
04:57:14.330 --> 04:57:14.340 align:start position:0%
these positions to better align
 
04:57:16.490 --> 04:57:16.500 align:start position:0%
um just just get given the nature of the
 
04:57:17.570 --> 04:57:17.580 align:start position:0%
work and given the fact that we've had
 
04:57:19.670 --> 04:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
to continue doing enhancements first so
 
04:57:22.430 --> 04:57:22.440 align:start position:0%
so this this dovetails actually with one
 
04:57:24.650 --> 04:57:24.660 align:start position:0%
of Representative Hull's observation so
 
04:57:27.590 --> 04:57:27.600 align:start position:0%
we have opportunities to move people
 
04:57:29.510 --> 04:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
from classified to unclassified
 
04:57:32.090 --> 04:57:32.100 align:start position:0%
positions so this is just two but these
 
04:57:34.128 --> 04:57:34.138 align:start position:0%
this is a good example of two that could
 
04:57:37.190 --> 04:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
be unclassified I'm I'm in support of
 
04:57:40.730 --> 04:57:40.740 align:start position:0%
this HP item is there any opposition to
 
04:57:40.740 --> 04:57:42.470 align:start position:0%
this HP item is there any opposition to
it

04:57:42.470 --> 04:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:57:44.628 --> 04:57:44.638 align:start position:0%
let's let's do a show of hands if you're
 
04:57:47.930 --> 04:57:47.940 align:start position:0%
in favor of leaving this raise your hand
 
04:57:50.750 --> 04:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
okay that looks unanimous
 
04:57:59.390 --> 04:57:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:01.490 --> 04:58:01.500 align:start position:0%
zero likewise establishes unclassified
 
04:58:03.350 --> 04:58:03.360 align:start position:0%
positions and abolishes classified
 
04:58:04.850 --> 04:58:04.860 align:start position:0%
positions but this one has an
 
04:58:11.390 --> 04:58:11.400 align:start position:0%
appropriation of 141 024 and 140 025.
 
04:58:14.750 --> 04:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
any opposition to this
 
04:58:17.030 --> 04:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
it raise your hand if you're in favor of
 
04:58:21.550 --> 04:58:21.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:24.410 --> 04:58:24.420 align:start position:0%
raise your hand if you're opposed
 
04:58:27.708 --> 04:58:27.718 align:start position:0%
so there was an abstention there eight
 
04:58:29.570 --> 04:58:29.580 align:start position:0%
zero one
 
04:58:29.580 --> 04:58:33.890 align:start position:0%
zero one
retain

04:58:33.890 --> 04:58:33.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:33.900 --> 04:58:38.708 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:58:38.708 --> 04:58:38.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:43.430 --> 04:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
okay so now we're on two three one
 
04:58:46.970 --> 04:58:46.980 align:start position:0%
uh and this is this is a goofy thing it
 
04:58:48.830 --> 04:58:48.840 align:start position:0%
just doesn't even feel to me like it
 
04:58:50.750 --> 04:58:50.760 align:start position:0%
makes sense to have it but it doesn't
 
04:58:53.090 --> 04:58:53.100 align:start position:0%
seem to do any harm either
 
04:58:56.090 --> 04:58:56.100 align:start position:0%
it says you can't put we cannot admit
 
04:59:01.250 --> 04:59:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:03.590 --> 04:59:03.600 align:start position:0%
you want to go back to 230
 
04:59:03.600 --> 04:59:05.470 align:start position:0%
you want to go back to 230
yes

04:59:05.470 --> 04:59:05.480 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:59:07.910 --> 04:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
Nathan um do you know if all of those
 
04:59:10.550 --> 04:59:10.560 align:start position:0%
positions are currently fulfilled
 
04:59:13.730 --> 04:59:13.740 align:start position:0%
this is the attorneys underneath the
 
04:59:16.310 --> 04:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
commissioner yeah so currently there are
 
04:59:19.490 --> 04:59:19.500 align:start position:0%
there are six vacancies in that area
 
04:59:21.890 --> 04:59:21.900 align:start position:0%
um this has been a key priority for
 
04:59:24.590 --> 04:59:24.600 align:start position:0%
Melissa stains here she had spoken to to
 
04:59:26.270 --> 04:59:26.280 align:start position:0%
the committee about this uh she's the
 
04:59:27.830 --> 04:59:27.840 align:start position:0%
chief legal counsel and a number of
 
04:59:29.510 --> 04:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
weeks ago
 
04:59:31.788 --> 04:59:31.798 align:start position:0%
um and and it just the the part of the
 
04:59:33.948 --> 04:59:33.958 align:start position:0%
reason behind this is that
 
04:59:36.410 --> 04:59:36.420 align:start position:0%
the way that their work schedules
 
04:59:39.350 --> 04:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
you know are need need to work out are
 
04:59:40.730 --> 04:59:40.740 align:start position:0%
like they'll have workloads that
 
04:59:42.530 --> 04:59:42.540 align:start position:0%
fluctuate one day or one week and then
 
04:59:44.208 --> 04:59:44.218 align:start position:0%
they'll decrease so they're a little
 
04:59:46.490 --> 04:59:46.500 align:start position:0%
less consistent um the workload in this
 
04:59:49.128 --> 04:59:49.138 align:start position:0%
area generally has been very high and as
 
04:59:50.930 --> 04:59:50.940 align:start position:0%
a result of those vacancies they have
 
04:59:53.150 --> 04:59:53.160 align:start position:0%
been struggling with that and we we have
 
04:59:56.090 --> 04:59:56.100 align:start position:0%
had increased comp time and overtime in
 
04:59:58.448 --> 04:59:58.458 align:start position:0%
this area to meet those unmet needs okay
 
05:00:02.390 --> 05:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
do you know I'm on page 79 whether those
 
05:00:04.788 --> 05:00:04.798 align:start position:0%
are the staff attorney level or the
 
05:00:07.730 --> 05:00:07.740 align:start position:0%
supervisory level or the supervising I'm
 
05:00:08.990 --> 05:00:09.000 align:start position:0%
not sure the difference between the last
 
05:00:10.970 --> 05:00:10.980 align:start position:0%
two this is a b and c on that section
 
05:00:13.310 --> 05:00:13.320 align:start position:0%
the vacancies yes I don't know if top of
 
05:00:15.770 --> 05:00:15.780 align:start position:0%
my head thank you
 
05:00:18.830 --> 05:00:18.840 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead by making these
 
05:00:21.110 --> 05:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
unclassified does that allow them to get
 
05:00:24.350 --> 05:00:24.360 align:start position:0%
overtime and and that sort of thing
 
05:00:27.590 --> 05:00:27.600 align:start position:0%
no precisely the opposite so
 
05:00:29.690 --> 05:00:29.700 align:start position:0%
um by making them unclassified they
 
05:00:32.810 --> 05:00:32.820 align:start position:0%
would not be eligible for over time they
 
05:00:34.670 --> 05:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
would be subject to a standard 40 hour
 
05:00:37.070 --> 05:00:37.080 align:start position:0%
break however if if the the business
 
05:00:39.830 --> 05:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
needs require them to work 45 or 50
 
05:00:39.840 --> 05:00:40.850 align:start position:0%
needs require them to work 45 or 50
hours

05:00:40.850 --> 05:00:40.860 align:start position:0%
hours
 
05:00:42.170 --> 05:00:42.180 align:start position:0%
um they would not receive overtime for
 
05:00:44.390 --> 05:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
that work
 
05:00:46.070 --> 05:00:46.080 align:start position:0%
you said they're not allowed to get
 
05:00:50.708 --> 05:00:50.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:53.750 --> 05:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
current well I thought I thought that's
 
05:00:56.330 --> 05:00:56.340 align:start position:0%
what classified was classified was like
 
05:00:59.990 --> 05:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:01.250 --> 05:01:01.260 align:start position:0%
and what am I what am I thinking
 
05:01:01.260 --> 05:01:03.530 align:start position:0%
and what am I what am I thinking
unclassified

05:01:03.530 --> 05:01:03.540 align:start position:0%
unclassified
 
05:01:05.750 --> 05:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
you can get overtime no no other way
 
05:01:05.760 --> 05:01:06.890 align:start position:0%
you can get overtime no no other way
around

05:01:06.890 --> 05:01:06.900 align:start position:0%
around
 
05:01:08.330 --> 05:01:08.340 align:start position:0%
that's right that that would be the
 
05:01:10.208 --> 05:01:10.218 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and so on all right okay
 
05:01:13.610 --> 05:01:13.620 align:start position:0%
thank you so we voted on this once so we
 
05:01:14.930 --> 05:01:14.940 align:start position:0%
want to keep talking about it yeah just
 
05:01:16.850 --> 05:01:16.860 align:start position:0%
one another quick question do we have
 
05:01:18.590 --> 05:01:18.600 align:start position:0%
any idea how much the overtime was for
 
05:01:18.600 --> 05:01:19.550 align:start position:0%
any idea how much the overtime was for
that

05:01:19.550 --> 05:01:19.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:01:21.590 --> 05:01:21.600 align:start position:0%
is there any way to figure that out
 
05:01:23.990 --> 05:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh yes I I could figure that I would
 
05:01:25.368 --> 05:01:25.378 align:start position:0%
just take take a little while just have
 
05:01:27.170 --> 05:01:27.180 align:start position:0%
to run a couple reports that's fine no
 
05:01:29.690 --> 05:01:29.700 align:start position:0%
problem thank you okay because I'm going
 
05:01:30.770 --> 05:01:30.780 align:start position:0%
to start getting just a little
 
05:01:32.930 --> 05:01:32.940 align:start position:0%
Persnickety if it doesn't affect your
 
05:01:36.230 --> 05:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
vote uh let's let's try to move on
 
05:01:39.650 --> 05:01:39.660 align:start position:0%
uh 231
 
05:01:41.448 --> 05:01:41.458 align:start position:0%
I would remove it just because I think
 
05:01:45.890 --> 05:01:45.900 align:start position:0%
it's dumb but hey we agree yeah
 
05:01:49.550 --> 05:01:49.560 align:start position:0%
um but it doesn't do any harm other than
 
05:01:51.288 --> 05:01:51.298 align:start position:0%
it's dumb
 
05:01:54.288 --> 05:01:54.298 align:start position:0%
and there's uh I'm going to ask you to
 
05:01:56.448 --> 05:01:56.458 align:start position:0%
raise your hand
 
05:01:58.390 --> 05:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
if you want to
 
05:02:04.070 --> 05:02:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:05.868 --> 05:02:05.878 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask you to raise your hand
 
05:02:09.350 --> 05:02:09.360 align:start position:0%
if you want to remove 231.
 
05:02:09.360 --> 05:02:17.208 align:start position:0%
if you want to remove 231.
okay

05:02:17.208 --> 05:02:17.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:17.218 --> 05:02:19.010 align:start position:0%
 
delete

05:02:19.010 --> 05:02:19.020 align:start position:0%
delete
 
05:02:22.670 --> 05:02:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:26.868 --> 05:02:26.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:26.878 --> 05:02:29.090 align:start position:0%
 
allows

05:02:29.090 --> 05:02:29.100 align:start position:0%
allows
 
05:02:30.708 --> 05:02:30.718 align:start position:0%
well this confirms the department of
 
05:02:33.410 --> 05:02:33.420 align:start position:0%
statutory ability to carry forward funds
 
05:02:35.270 --> 05:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
from three accounts the developmental
 
05:02:37.010 --> 05:02:37.020 align:start position:0%
disabilities account acquired brain
 
05:02:39.470 --> 05:02:39.480 align:start position:0%
disorder services and children's In-Home
 
05:02:41.810 --> 05:02:41.820 align:start position:0%
Support Services I don't have any
 
05:02:44.810 --> 05:02:44.820 align:start position:0%
amendments to this section but I don't
 
05:02:44.820 --> 05:02:46.310 align:start position:0%
amendments to this section but I don't
know

05:02:46.310 --> 05:02:46.320 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:02:48.230 --> 05:02:48.240 align:start position:0%
representative Earth did you want to
 
05:02:48.240 --> 05:02:50.390 align:start position:0%
representative Earth did you want to
address

05:02:50.390 --> 05:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
address
 
05:02:52.670 --> 05:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
so if I'm not mistaken this is one of
 
05:02:56.690 --> 05:02:56.700 align:start position:0%
the three accounts that for which
 
05:02:59.390 --> 05:02:59.400 align:start position:0%
funds are continually appropriated yes
 
05:03:01.730 --> 05:03:01.740 align:start position:0%
that's correct these three yeah so it's
 
05:03:04.490 --> 05:03:04.500 align:start position:0%
these three that we should whole I think
 
05:03:06.170 --> 05:03:06.180 align:start position:0%
I think CFI is another one coming up at
 
05:03:06.180 --> 05:03:07.610 align:start position:0%
I think CFI is another one coming up at
234.

05:03:07.610 --> 05:03:07.620 align:start position:0%
234.
 
05:03:09.350 --> 05:03:09.360 align:start position:0%
and then the big one is it is the DD
 
05:03:11.868 --> 05:03:11.878 align:start position:0%
account I believe which is further on
 
05:03:14.930 --> 05:03:14.940 align:start position:0%
and and I would suggest we hold those in
 
05:03:16.970 --> 05:03:16.980 align:start position:0%
terms of our discussion related to
 
05:03:19.128 --> 05:03:19.138 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rates
 
05:03:19.138 --> 05:03:20.208 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rates
okay

05:03:20.208 --> 05:03:20.218 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:03:22.190 --> 05:03:22.200 align:start position:0%
but that's just my suggestion I can go
 
05:03:24.110 --> 05:03:24.120 align:start position:0%
into details as to why if the group
 
05:03:26.030 --> 05:03:26.040 align:start position:0%
disagrees or wants to hear I I don't
 
05:03:28.788 --> 05:03:28.798 align:start position:0%
mind holding do you want to hold him
 
05:03:28.798 --> 05:03:30.770 align:start position:0%
mind holding do you want to hold him
okay

05:03:30.770 --> 05:03:30.780 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:03:34.190 --> 05:03:34.200 align:start position:0%
um so you got track on which three we're
 
05:03:34.200 --> 05:03:35.628 align:start position:0%
um so you got track on which three we're
holding

05:03:35.628 --> 05:03:35.638 align:start position:0%
holding
 
05:03:37.788 --> 05:03:37.798 align:start position:0%
well I think this section alone you're
 
05:03:39.590 --> 05:03:39.600 align:start position:0%
holding for now because this pertains to
 
05:03:40.970 --> 05:03:40.980 align:start position:0%
three accounts developmental Services
 
05:03:42.770 --> 05:03:42.780 align:start position:0%
acquired brain disorder and In-Home
 
05:03:45.110 --> 05:03:45.120 align:start position:0%
Support funds
 
05:03:46.850 --> 05:03:46.860 align:start position:0%
right but don't does also impact some
 
05:03:46.860 --> 05:03:47.750 align:start position:0%
right but don't does also impact some
other

05:03:47.750 --> 05:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
other
 
05:03:49.970 --> 05:03:49.980 align:start position:0%
sections of the that we're going to come
 
05:03:55.550 --> 05:03:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:58.010 --> 05:03:58.020 align:start position:0%
I don't think so okay all right okay
 
05:04:01.990 --> 05:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
fine you you want to do County cap
 
05:04:04.910 --> 05:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
well sure but it kind of
 
05:04:06.890 --> 05:04:06.900 align:start position:0%
the dog tells us with what I thought was
 
05:04:08.628 --> 05:04:08.638 align:start position:0%
you part of this so should we hold this
 
05:04:10.610 --> 05:04:10.620 align:start position:0%
as well so it's all one comprehensive
 
05:04:13.010 --> 05:04:13.020 align:start position:0%
discussion that's fine with me I can
 
05:04:16.010 --> 05:04:16.020 align:start position:0%
give an overview just real quickly of so
 
05:04:18.590 --> 05:04:18.600 align:start position:0%
so you did that when I wasn't here the
 
05:04:20.810 --> 05:04:20.820 align:start position:0%
county cap but we've talked offline I'm
 
05:04:22.490 --> 05:04:22.500 align:start position:0%
okay with you doing what you're doing
 
05:04:24.830 --> 05:04:24.840 align:start position:0%
okay is there is there anyone else in
 
05:04:27.230 --> 05:04:27.240 align:start position:0%
the room that would like to hear a
 
05:04:29.150 --> 05:04:29.160 align:start position:0%
synopsis or a summary of what
 
05:04:31.190 --> 05:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
representative burf is proposing for the
 
05:04:33.470 --> 05:04:33.480 align:start position:0%
county cap we'll have to wait for the
 
05:04:36.170 --> 05:04:36.180 align:start position:0%
details in a detailed discussion until
 
05:04:39.110 --> 05:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
Monday but actually do you have the
 
05:04:41.628 --> 05:04:41.638 align:start position:0%
amendment just so people could could
 
05:04:43.310 --> 05:04:43.320 align:start position:0%
have it for the weekend and read it
 
05:04:45.350 --> 05:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
that'd be good
 
05:04:47.208 --> 05:04:47.218 align:start position:0%
so we don't need to go through it today
 
05:04:50.270 --> 05:04:50.280 align:start position:0%
did you have a question represent no
 
05:04:52.010 --> 05:04:52.020 align:start position:0%
and if you'd like I can hand out the
 
05:04:53.570 --> 05:04:53.580 align:start position:0%
house bill one side of this as well yeah
 
05:04:55.368 --> 05:04:55.378 align:start position:0%
I do both that'd be a good idea and then
 
05:05:09.890 --> 05:05:09.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:11.990 --> 05:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
so he's simply handing that out there's
 
05:05:14.150 --> 05:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
not discussion now so I'm going to go
 
05:05:15.590 --> 05:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
ahead and start
 
05:05:17.930 --> 05:05:17.940 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
05:05:22.730 --> 05:05:22.740 align:start position:0%
uh we're on 234 choices for Independence
 
05:05:22.740 --> 05:05:24.470 align:start position:0%
uh we're on 234 choices for Independence
program

05:05:24.470 --> 05:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
program
 
05:05:26.570 --> 05:05:26.580 align:start position:0%
that appropriates General funds in the
 
05:05:30.470 --> 05:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
amount of 4.75 million and 24 and 10.35
 
05:05:37.910 --> 05:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
and 25 to ensure adequate funds uh so I
 
05:05:40.610 --> 05:05:40.620 align:start position:0%
I like choices for Independence for
 
05:05:43.310 --> 05:05:43.320 align:start position:0%
about three or four really big reasons
 
05:05:47.150 --> 05:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
the only the only issue I have that
 
05:05:49.610 --> 05:05:49.620 align:start position:0%
causes me to stumble a little bit to say
 
05:05:52.550 --> 05:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
yeah let's go ahead with this is we've
 
05:05:55.430 --> 05:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
got the Medicaid rate increase
 
05:05:58.850 --> 05:05:58.860 align:start position:0%
discussion going on in parallel and so
 
05:06:01.670 --> 05:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
so I I just don't want to get myself
 
05:06:05.448 --> 05:06:05.458 align:start position:0%
confused about if we say yes to this 15
 
05:06:08.030 --> 05:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
million how that affects that
 
05:06:10.910 --> 05:06:10.920 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet we looked at earlier and and
 
05:06:13.010 --> 05:06:13.020 align:start position:0%
the totals that we're we're wanting to
 
05:06:17.030 --> 05:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
spend so so because of that and because
 
05:06:18.288 --> 05:06:18.298 align:start position:0%
I know we're going to talk about
 
05:06:21.170 --> 05:06:21.180 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rates in more detail and we got
 
05:06:24.350 --> 05:06:24.360 align:start position:0%
something on hold I would propose that
 
05:06:27.230 --> 05:06:27.240 align:start position:0%
we hold this unless somebody wants to
 
05:06:30.530 --> 05:06:30.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:34.128 --> 05:06:34.138 align:start position:0%
I I'm I'm predisposed in favor but it's
 
05:06:35.810 --> 05:06:35.820 align:start position:0%
just I just want to make sure that the
 
05:06:40.070 --> 05:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:41.390 --> 05:06:41.400 align:start position:0%
I agree with the hold I'm actually
 
05:06:44.030 --> 05:06:44.040 align:start position:0%
predisposed to delete it just because
 
05:06:46.010 --> 05:06:46.020 align:start position:0%
this Opera replacement funds and I think
 
05:06:47.868 --> 05:06:47.878 align:start position:0%
we should use them the way you just
 
05:06:49.910 --> 05:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
described what we decide to use them
 
05:06:51.770 --> 05:06:51.780 align:start position:0%
with the whole rate process but anyway
 
05:06:54.170 --> 05:06:54.180 align:start position:0%
so agree to hold so if we were to hold
 
05:06:57.230 --> 05:06:57.240 align:start position:0%
it what it sounds to me you just said is
 
05:06:58.970 --> 05:06:58.980 align:start position:0%
at the end of our discussion we're
 
05:07:00.708 --> 05:07:00.718 align:start position:0%
likely to want to come back and just
 
05:07:02.510 --> 05:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
delete this because we'll have taken
 
05:07:04.190 --> 05:07:04.200 align:start position:0%
care of it elsewhere
 
05:07:07.310 --> 05:07:07.320 align:start position:0%
and use the money elsewhere yes it's
 
05:07:08.628 --> 05:07:08.638 align:start position:0%
still weight setting but not not
 
05:07:10.128 --> 05:07:10.138 align:start position:0%
necessarily dedicated to this all right
 
05:07:12.590 --> 05:07:12.600 align:start position:0%
so preview of coming attractions
 
05:07:12.600 --> 05:07:14.030 align:start position:0%
so preview of coming attractions
uh

05:07:14.030 --> 05:07:14.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:07:15.350 --> 05:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
uh so just briefly so people understand
 
05:07:18.830 --> 05:07:18.840 align:start position:0%
what they just got from Mr Ripple
 
05:07:20.750 --> 05:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
so the intent here is to there's a
 
05:07:22.550 --> 05:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
reason there's two pieces to it the hb2
 
05:07:25.330 --> 05:07:25.340 align:start position:0%
piece which is the the vertical sheet
 
05:07:27.590 --> 05:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
essentially not essentially this is what
 
05:07:29.810 --> 05:07:29.820 align:start position:0%
it does it freezes the county cap at the
 
05:07:32.448 --> 05:07:32.458 align:start position:0%
current this FY 23 level very
 
05:07:33.530 --> 05:07:33.540 align:start position:0%
straightforward for the next two years
 
05:07:35.090 --> 05:07:35.100 align:start position:0%
only does it make any changes to law
 
05:07:38.230 --> 05:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
other than that the hb-1 amendment
 
05:07:40.670 --> 05:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
reflects what's going on in HP one so
 
05:07:42.770 --> 05:07:42.780 align:start position:0%
the governor um or the governor's budget
 
05:07:44.288 --> 05:07:44.298 align:start position:0%
I should say
 
05:07:47.628 --> 05:07:47.638 align:start position:0%
it incorrectly calculated the values
 
05:07:50.090 --> 05:07:50.100 align:start position:0%
that are required by current law so if
 
05:07:51.890 --> 05:07:51.900 align:start position:0%
you look beside description there in the
 
05:07:53.270 --> 05:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
middle of the page number one it says
 
05:07:55.550 --> 05:07:55.560 align:start position:0%
there's a 10 million dollars needed to
 
05:07:57.410 --> 05:07:57.420 align:start position:0%
correct that mistake basically a little
 
05:08:00.470 --> 05:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
bit in in uh 24 and a little bit in 25
 
05:08:02.810 --> 05:08:02.820 align:start position:0%
and then the effect of the freeze the
 
05:08:04.310 --> 05:08:04.320 align:start position:0%
part that I actually want to implement
 
05:08:07.910 --> 05:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
is the 7.9 million across those two
 
05:08:10.250 --> 05:08:10.260 align:start position:0%
years and then down below is are the
 
05:08:11.810 --> 05:08:11.820 align:start position:0%
details which I won't go through them
 
05:08:13.550 --> 05:08:13.560 align:start position:0%
right now but this shows you how it's
 
05:08:15.350 --> 05:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
basically being accounted for so we're
 
05:08:17.330 --> 05:08:17.340 align:start position:0%
talking about basically 17 18 million
 
05:08:19.010 --> 05:08:19.020 align:start position:0%
dollars that that's going to suck up
 
05:08:22.430 --> 05:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
from uh somewhere
 
05:08:24.110 --> 05:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
so so that kind of goes into that whole
 
05:08:25.490 --> 05:08:25.500 align:start position:0%
bucket of how where are we going to find
 
05:08:28.788 --> 05:08:28.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:31.788 --> 05:08:31.798 align:start position:0%
so we did this for the first time last
 
05:08:35.590 --> 05:08:35.600 align:start position:0%
term where we reduced the the county cap
 
05:08:38.890 --> 05:08:38.900 align:start position:0%
and in Rockingham County
 
05:08:43.850 --> 05:08:43.860 align:start position:0%
uh they they loved it because what the
 
05:08:47.628 --> 05:08:47.638 align:start position:0%
CFO told me was by us doing the uh
 
05:08:50.930 --> 05:08:50.940 align:start position:0%
additional contribution that meant that
 
05:08:53.330 --> 05:08:53.340 align:start position:0%
they could reduce seven percentage
 
05:08:56.510 --> 05:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
points off of their total property tax
 
05:08:56.520 --> 05:08:57.708 align:start position:0%
points off of their total property tax
levy

05:08:57.708 --> 05:08:57.718 align:start position:0%
levy
 
05:09:00.050 --> 05:09:00.060 align:start position:0%
so when we do this we're actually
 
05:09:03.170 --> 05:09:03.180 align:start position:0%
directly directly helping the counties
 
05:09:06.590 --> 05:09:06.600 align:start position:0%
reduce their property tax levies
 
05:09:09.410 --> 05:09:09.420 align:start position:0%
the devil's in the detail but that big
 
05:09:12.770 --> 05:09:12.780 align:start position:0%
picture view I I found important because
 
05:09:16.070 --> 05:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
of the desires to cut property taxes in
 
05:09:17.390 --> 05:09:17.400 align:start position:0%
so many corners
 
05:09:19.610 --> 05:09:19.620 align:start position:0%
does anyone want to talk about this
 
05:09:21.708 --> 05:09:21.718 align:start position:0%
further before we just hold it till
 
05:09:21.718 --> 05:09:22.970 align:start position:0%
further before we just hold it till
Monday

05:09:22.970 --> 05:09:22.980 align:start position:0%
Monday
 
05:09:24.590 --> 05:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
you look you look like you might have
 
05:09:32.090 --> 05:09:32.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:36.708 --> 05:09:36.718 align:start position:0%
okay oh yay let's talk about 235 the
 
05:09:36.718 --> 05:09:38.750 align:start position:0%
okay oh yay let's talk about 235 the
mmis

05:09:38.750 --> 05:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
mmis
 
05:09:40.610 --> 05:09:40.620 align:start position:0%
was there an amendment on this what are
 
05:09:42.708 --> 05:09:42.718 align:start position:0%
we doing on this
 
05:09:45.050 --> 05:09:45.060 align:start position:0%
you do have an amendment did you decide
 
05:09:46.368 --> 05:09:46.378 align:start position:0%
to skip
 
05:09:47.930 --> 05:09:47.940 align:start position:0%
or maybe this is the one of the ones
 
05:09:49.190 --> 05:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
that representative erf wanted to hold
 
05:09:52.550 --> 05:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
on Section 234 funding for CFI
 
05:09:56.448 --> 05:09:56.458 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at 235 we did hold CFI right
 
05:09:59.150 --> 05:09:59.160 align:start position:0%
that's we are holding CFI to talk we
 
05:10:01.550 --> 05:10:01.560 align:start position:0%
loaded that while you were walking okay
 
05:10:04.550 --> 05:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
so we're on the mmis thing the um the
 
05:10:06.170 --> 05:10:06.180 align:start position:0%
maintenance component
 
05:10:09.410 --> 05:10:09.420 align:start position:0%
yes and I do have an amendment for that
 
05:10:11.448 --> 05:10:11.458 align:start position:0%
and again it has both the house bill 2
 
05:10:13.430 --> 05:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
and a house bill one component
 
05:10:14.628 --> 05:10:14.638 align:start position:0%
um and so this is what the division I'll
 
05:10:16.250 --> 05:10:16.260 align:start position:0%
hand it out just in a moment this is
 
05:10:18.110 --> 05:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
what the division talked about the other
 
05:10:20.570 --> 05:10:20.580 align:start position:0%
day allowing the department to carry
 
05:10:23.510 --> 05:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
forward 20.5 million dollars and treat
 
05:10:25.250 --> 05:10:25.260 align:start position:0%
it in the operating budget as restricted
 
05:10:27.230 --> 05:10:27.240 align:start position:0%
revenue for the purpose of funding mmis
 
05:10:29.868 --> 05:10:29.878 align:start position:0%
so if I can find those I'll hand them
 
05:10:32.030 --> 05:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
out right now so so I think we were
 
05:10:34.190 --> 05:10:34.200 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish two things I think
 
05:10:36.948 --> 05:10:36.958 align:start position:0%
from a principal's perspective
 
05:10:39.708 --> 05:10:39.718 align:start position:0%
we were trying to
 
05:10:44.330 --> 05:10:44.340 align:start position:0%
keep hb1 reflecting actual operating
 
05:10:46.910 --> 05:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
expenses and so we wanted to get it out
 
05:10:49.550 --> 05:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
of hb2 so that there would be continuity
 
05:10:51.590 --> 05:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
and transparency on what we're spending
 
05:10:53.270 --> 05:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
from an operations and maintenance
 
05:10:57.830 --> 05:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
perspective in HP one into the future
 
05:11:01.430 --> 05:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
but on the other hand this had
 
05:11:05.810 --> 05:11:05.820 align:start position:0%
FY 23 carryover money associated with it
 
05:11:08.628 --> 05:11:08.638 align:start position:0%
in hb2 and we didn't want to lose
 
05:11:12.490 --> 05:11:12.500 align:start position:0%
that funding source from hb23 carryover
 
05:11:16.070 --> 05:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
so so in trying to split those two
 
05:11:16.080 --> 05:11:17.690 align:start position:0%
so so in trying to split those two
principles

05:11:17.690 --> 05:11:17.700 align:start position:0%
principles
 
05:11:20.810 --> 05:11:20.820 align:start position:0%
Mr Ripple has has come up with an
 
05:11:25.128 --> 05:11:25.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:28.310 --> 05:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
while he's Distributing is it were you
 
05:11:29.690 --> 05:11:29.700 align:start position:0%
listening to what I said is that
 
05:11:31.788 --> 05:11:31.798 align:start position:0%
accurate with from your perspective what
 
05:11:35.350 --> 05:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:39.230 --> 05:11:39.240 align:start position:0%
yes I I I for just from a general
 
05:11:40.850 --> 05:11:40.860 align:start position:0%
accounting perspective I think it makes
 
05:11:43.550 --> 05:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
the most sense to be to include this in
 
05:11:45.230 --> 05:11:45.240 align:start position:0%
in the budget
 
05:11:46.490 --> 05:11:46.500 align:start position:0%
um within the within the operating
 
05:11:50.448 --> 05:11:50.458 align:start position:0%
budget in HP one get it out of hp2
 
05:11:52.610 --> 05:11:52.620 align:start position:0%
while simultaneously
 
05:11:54.948 --> 05:11:54.958 align:start position:0%
from a revenue perspective not losing
 
05:11:58.610 --> 05:11:58.620 align:start position:0%
the carryover from the current budget
 
05:11:58.620 --> 05:12:01.430 align:start position:0%
the carryover from the current budget
yeah

05:12:01.430 --> 05:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:04.490 --> 05:12:04.500 align:start position:0%
okay this is carried over because they
 
05:12:07.368 --> 05:12:07.378 align:start position:0%
never did the program right no no no
 
05:12:11.270 --> 05:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
this is the ongoing maintenance contract
 
05:12:14.208 --> 05:12:14.218 align:start position:0%
this is not the uh upgrade funding I
 
05:12:16.070 --> 05:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
think it was in the capital budget so
 
05:12:17.990 --> 05:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
one of the one of the pieces of
 
05:12:20.208 --> 05:12:20.218 align:start position:0%
testimony you may not have been here for
 
05:12:24.708 --> 05:12:24.718 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler was uh that it it
 
05:12:28.850 --> 05:12:28.860 align:start position:0%
dawned on me if not anyone else how
 
05:12:33.708 --> 05:12:33.718 align:start position:0%
wrong I was about how much it costs just
 
05:12:35.930 --> 05:12:35.940 align:start position:0%
to do the operations and maintenance of
 
05:12:38.750 --> 05:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
this system when I saw a 20 million
 
05:12:41.930 --> 05:12:41.940 align:start position:0%
dollar bill last time I could have sworn
 
05:12:44.570 --> 05:12:44.580 align:start position:0%
that had to be like a capital
 
05:12:44.580 --> 05:12:46.190 align:start position:0%
that had to be like a capital
Improvement

05:12:46.190 --> 05:12:46.200 align:start position:0%
Improvement
 
05:12:48.948 --> 05:12:48.958 align:start position:0%
but it's not this is just a god-awful
 
05:12:53.390 --> 05:12:53.400 align:start position:0%
expensive system to maintain and and I
 
05:12:55.190 --> 05:12:55.200 align:start position:0%
it makes me very uncomfortable they're
 
05:12:57.050 --> 05:12:57.060 align:start position:0%
taking it back out to reacquisition
 
05:12:58.970 --> 05:12:58.980 align:start position:0%
they're doing a redesign to make a
 
05:13:00.948 --> 05:13:00.958 align:start position:0%
modular so that they could plug and play
 
05:13:03.708 --> 05:13:03.718 align:start position:0%
maybe less expensive components over in
 
05:13:06.890 --> 05:13:06.900 align:start position:0%
the future but right now this just feels
 
05:13:09.410 --> 05:13:09.420 align:start position:0%
to me like we've painted ourselves into
 
05:13:11.628 --> 05:13:11.638 align:start position:0%
a very expensive Corner that we can't
 
05:13:14.628 --> 05:13:14.638 align:start position:0%
get out because this system is essential
 
05:13:17.390 --> 05:13:17.400 align:start position:0%
to us being able to document compliance
 
05:13:19.010 --> 05:13:19.020 align:start position:0%
with the federal program
 
05:13:21.708 --> 05:13:21.718 align:start position:0%
I remember several fiscal meetings where
 
05:13:23.288 --> 05:13:23.298 align:start position:0%
we said it's
 
05:13:25.430 --> 05:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
m-i-m-m-i-s up yet
 
05:13:28.970 --> 05:13:28.980 align:start position:0%
and it was it was years delayed
 
05:13:33.670 --> 05:13:33.680 align:start position:0%
okay so is there any discussion on this
 
05:13:36.170 --> 05:13:36.180 align:start position:0%
let me go back to you Mr herbal since
 
05:13:38.270 --> 05:13:38.280 align:start position:0%
you've been handing this out could you
 
05:13:40.190 --> 05:13:40.200 align:start position:0%
just summarize for us what you think
 
05:13:43.010 --> 05:13:43.020 align:start position:0%
we're doing now with 235 based on these
 
05:13:45.530 --> 05:13:45.540 align:start position:0%
amendments sure if you adopted both of
 
05:13:49.250 --> 05:13:49.260 align:start position:0%
these you would still be using fiscal 23
 
05:13:54.948 --> 05:13:54.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:56.208 --> 05:13:56.218 align:start position:0%
let me think about that for a second
 
05:13:58.250 --> 05:13:58.260 align:start position:0%
yeah you would allow the department to
 
05:14:01.070 --> 05:14:01.080 align:start position:0%
carry forward for use in 24 25 and so it
 
05:14:02.570 --> 05:14:02.580 align:start position:0%
would show up in the operating budget
 
05:14:05.810 --> 05:14:05.820 align:start position:0%
here as 24.25 and so on the line that
 
05:14:08.810 --> 05:14:08.820 align:start position:0%
reads agency income that 9.7 million
 
05:14:11.208 --> 05:14:11.218 align:start position:0%
that's being added in 24 and the 10.8
 
05:14:13.430 --> 05:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
million that's being added in 25 that's
 
05:14:15.350 --> 05:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
the amount that's carried forward and
 
05:14:16.850 --> 05:14:16.860 align:start position:0%
the department would get Federal
 
05:14:18.650 --> 05:14:18.660 align:start position:0%
matching funds on the next line so those
 
05:14:22.070 --> 05:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:25.070 --> 05:14:25.080 align:start position:0%
all right so we we have talked about
 
05:14:27.650 --> 05:14:27.660 align:start position:0%
this before but it's a it's it's kind of
 
05:14:30.590 --> 05:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
it can be a lot is there any discussion
 
05:14:34.128 --> 05:14:34.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:36.948 --> 05:14:36.958 align:start position:0%
can we can we can we give Mr Ripple
 
05:14:39.650 --> 05:14:39.660 align:start position:0%
guidance on this now or do or is there a
 
05:14:42.770 --> 05:14:42.780 align:start position:0%
desire to think and soak on this over
 
05:14:44.868 --> 05:14:44.878 align:start position:0%
the weekend go ahead I just want to
 
05:14:46.610 --> 05:14:46.620 align:start position:0%
clarify if I'm understanding this
 
05:14:48.708 --> 05:14:48.718 align:start position:0%
correctly so I understand that we're
 
05:14:48.718 --> 05:14:49.970 align:start position:0%
correctly so I understand that we're
moving

05:14:49.970 --> 05:14:49.980 align:start position:0%
moving
 
05:14:52.368 --> 05:14:52.378 align:start position:0%
um the appropriation to hb1 and I see it
 
05:14:54.890 --> 05:14:54.900 align:start position:0%
over the two years it's 2023 money that
 
05:14:56.810 --> 05:14:56.820 align:start position:0%
we are allowing them to do that
 
05:14:59.270 --> 05:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
the amendment to hb2
 
05:15:01.610 --> 05:15:01.620 align:start position:0%
does this simply say that we are
 
05:15:04.368 --> 05:15:04.378 align:start position:0%
authorizing the department to spread
 
05:15:06.830 --> 05:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
that 2023 money out through the end of
 
05:15:06.840 --> 05:15:08.750 align:start position:0%
that 2023 money out through the end of
2025

05:15:08.750 --> 05:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
2025
 
05:15:13.910 --> 05:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:16.430 --> 05:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
okay I just I think I just worked it out
 
05:15:17.990 --> 05:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
in my head the the house bill 2
 
05:15:19.310 --> 05:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
amendment is needed to allow the
 
05:15:20.690 --> 05:15:20.700 align:start position:0%
department to carry those funds forward
 
05:15:22.730 --> 05:15:22.740 align:start position:0%
from 23 rather than letting them lapse
 
05:15:25.070 --> 05:15:25.080 align:start position:0%
okay and then the HP one Amendment
 
05:15:26.930 --> 05:15:26.940 align:start position:0%
actually outlines how that is going to
 
05:15:29.448 --> 05:15:29.458 align:start position:0%
be done yes okay I understand thank you
 
05:15:31.910 --> 05:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
05:15:35.030 --> 05:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
let's let's do a straw vote on this with
 
05:15:37.730 --> 05:15:37.740 align:start position:0%
with the another reminder that we can
 
05:15:40.070 --> 05:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
come back Monday and change our minds
 
05:15:42.110 --> 05:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
based on what we know and what we think
 
05:15:45.490 --> 05:15:45.500 align:start position:0%
right now are we comfortable accepting
 
05:15:49.430 --> 05:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
the HP one and two Amendment as drafted
 
05:15:52.850 --> 05:15:52.860 align:start position:0%
by Mr Ripple you have a
 
05:15:56.448 --> 05:15:56.458 align:start position:0%
okay so so so what we're straw voting on
 
05:15:58.550 --> 05:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
is are we going to accept the work
 
05:16:01.190 --> 05:16:01.200 align:start position:0%
product that Mr Ripple just handed to us
 
05:16:05.708 --> 05:16:05.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:09.288 --> 05:16:09.298 align:start position:0%
and then if you oppose I think that was
 
05:16:09.298 --> 05:16:10.430 align:start position:0%
and then if you oppose I think that was
unanimous

05:16:10.430 --> 05:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
unanimous
 
05:16:19.430 --> 05:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:22.610 --> 05:16:22.620 align:start position:0%
okay 237
 
05:16:29.990 --> 05:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:31.550 --> 05:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
so these are the funds basically for
 
05:16:31.560 --> 05:16:32.810 align:start position:0%
so these are the funds basically for
unwinding

05:16:32.810 --> 05:16:32.820 align:start position:0%
unwinding
 
05:16:34.570 --> 05:16:34.580 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid
 
05:16:37.070 --> 05:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
permanent Medicaid so to speak that we
 
05:16:39.288 --> 05:16:39.298 align:start position:0%
talked about earlier okay I I believe
 
05:16:41.150 --> 05:16:41.160 align:start position:0%
that I was given this I should have said
 
05:16:43.070 --> 05:16:43.080 align:start position:0%
Mr Ripple do you do you want to talk to
 
05:16:45.830 --> 05:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
237 that's just what Mr representative
 
05:16:47.570 --> 05:16:47.580 align:start position:0%
erf just said right I have nothing to
 
05:16:47.580 --> 05:16:48.590 align:start position:0%
erf just said right I have nothing to
add

05:16:48.590 --> 05:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
add
 
05:16:51.530 --> 05:16:51.540 align:start position:0%
takes a chair go ahead I have a naive
 
05:16:54.830 --> 05:16:54.840 align:start position:0%
question so I can currently hear that
 
05:16:57.010 --> 05:16:57.020 align:start position:0%
we're unraveling the expanded Medicaid
 
05:17:00.948 --> 05:17:00.958 align:start position:0%
and or unwinding I guess is the term and
 
05:17:02.750 --> 05:17:02.760 align:start position:0%
then we're continuing the program
 
05:17:04.310 --> 05:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
separately in the budget I don't know
 
05:17:04.320 --> 05:17:05.090 align:start position:0%
separately in the budget I don't know
how

05:17:05.090 --> 05:17:05.100 align:start position:0%
how
 
05:17:07.850 --> 05:17:07.860 align:start position:0%
to mesh those two ideas
 
05:17:10.970 --> 05:17:10.980 align:start position:0%
well the unwinding period is phased in
 
05:17:13.250 --> 05:17:13.260 align:start position:0%
over six to nine months I for I forget
 
05:17:15.110 --> 05:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
the numbers we've we've had them brief
 
05:17:16.850 --> 05:17:16.860 align:start position:0%
to us before but
 
05:17:18.948 --> 05:17:18.958 align:start position:0%
um so the unwinding period takes a
 
05:17:21.288 --> 05:17:21.298 align:start position:0%
period of time and while they're they're
 
05:17:23.750 --> 05:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
doing that trying to get the people who
 
05:17:25.970 --> 05:17:25.980 align:start position:0%
were only eligible because the federal
 
05:17:27.430 --> 05:17:27.440 align:start position:0%
health emergency
 
05:17:31.070 --> 05:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
offer the rolls they're checking before
 
05:17:32.810 --> 05:17:32.820 align:start position:0%
they remove them from the insurance
 
05:17:32.820 --> 05:17:34.730 align:start position:0%
they remove them from the insurance
rolls

05:17:34.730 --> 05:17:34.740 align:start position:0%
rolls
 
05:17:37.010 --> 05:17:37.020 align:start position:0%
as to whether or not they may qualify
 
05:17:38.390 --> 05:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
for something else
 
05:17:41.628 --> 05:17:41.638 align:start position:0%
so so the statistics on who might end up
 
05:17:44.510 --> 05:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
on what is ambiguous because we just
 
05:17:46.430 --> 05:17:46.440 align:start position:0%
know there's at least six to nine months
 
05:17:49.490 --> 05:17:49.500 align:start position:0%
of work with each individual involved
 
05:17:52.610 --> 05:17:52.620 align:start position:0%
and family individual and family go
 
05:17:55.010 --> 05:17:55.020 align:start position:0%
ahead represent Stringham Mr White if
 
05:17:56.570 --> 05:17:56.580 align:start position:0%
you could just comment what it says here
 
05:17:58.970 --> 05:17:58.980 align:start position:0%
in the sheet we got is These funds will
 
05:18:01.250 --> 05:18:01.260 align:start position:0%
be used to cover increased costs
 
05:18:03.470 --> 05:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
resulting from the regular and Chip
 
05:18:06.770 --> 05:18:06.780 align:start position:0%
increase in enrollees as the department
 
05:18:08.930 --> 05:18:08.940 align:start position:0%
unwinds the program and disenrolls
 
05:18:11.810 --> 05:18:11.820 align:start position:0%
individuals so to me that says that
 
05:18:13.788 --> 05:18:13.798 align:start position:0%
there's maybe going to be a permanent
 
05:18:16.850 --> 05:18:16.860 align:start position:0%
bump up in the number of people in the
 
05:18:18.530 --> 05:18:18.540 align:start position:0%
chips program and that's part of what
 
05:18:21.230 --> 05:18:21.240 align:start position:0%
these funds would be used for
 
05:18:23.150 --> 05:18:23.160 align:start position:0%
um is that accurate or what would be a
 
05:18:26.090 --> 05:18:26.100 align:start position:0%
better description so so the I apologize
 
05:18:28.190 --> 05:18:28.200 align:start position:0%
if the description wasn't clear so the
 
05:18:31.128 --> 05:18:31.138 align:start position:0%
primary purpose of this is to date for
 
05:18:33.070 --> 05:18:33.080 align:start position:0%
standard Medicaid we've been receiving
 
05:18:36.230 --> 05:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
6.2 percent as as a condition of the
 
05:18:38.150 --> 05:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
continuous enrollment
 
05:18:40.310 --> 05:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
um that phases out on April 1 where we
 
05:18:42.590 --> 05:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
start to receive five percent first
 
05:18:44.448 --> 05:18:44.458 align:start position:0%
quarter of State fiscal year 24 we
 
05:18:45.650 --> 05:18:45.660 align:start position:0%
receive a two and a half percent
 
05:18:47.750 --> 05:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
enhanced staff map and one and a half
 
05:18:49.910 --> 05:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
percent in the last quarter of calendar
 
05:18:54.948 --> 05:18:54.958 align:start position:0%
year uh 23. and so we this is an
 
05:18:58.190 --> 05:18:58.200 align:start position:0%
estimate based on our analysis at a at a
 
05:19:00.770 --> 05:19:00.780 align:start position:0%
rate level at an individual level where
 
05:19:02.868 --> 05:19:02.878 align:start position:0%
we still expect to
 
05:19:06.410 --> 05:19:06.420 align:start position:0%
um not have a sufficient federal funds
 
05:19:09.708 --> 05:19:09.718 align:start position:0%
to enhance federal funds to cover
 
05:19:11.448 --> 05:19:11.458 align:start position:0%
um kind of that that phase down so that
 
05:19:12.890 --> 05:19:12.900 align:start position:0%
over nine months we're going to be
 
05:19:15.470 --> 05:19:15.480 align:start position:0%
taking people off off the rolls so so
 
05:19:18.890 --> 05:19:18.900 align:start position:0%
this amount here is to cover those costs
 
05:19:20.628 --> 05:19:20.638 align:start position:0%
that for the past two years have been
 
05:19:22.610 --> 05:19:22.620 align:start position:0%
cover two and a half have been covered
 
05:19:26.208 --> 05:19:26.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:26.218 --> 05:19:27.470 align:start position:0%
 
uh

05:19:27.470 --> 05:19:27.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:19:27.480 --> 05:19:28.850 align:start position:0%
uh
so

05:19:28.850 --> 05:19:28.860 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:19:31.070 --> 05:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
um will there be an increase in the
 
05:19:32.510 --> 05:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
number of people in the chips program
 
05:19:34.430 --> 05:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
and has that covered somewhere else in
 
05:19:35.570 --> 05:19:35.580 align:start position:0%
the budget
 
05:19:39.230 --> 05:19:39.240 align:start position:0%
so right now we have we have experienced
 
05:19:41.990 --> 05:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
an increase in the in the chip program
 
05:19:44.150 --> 05:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
and and those costs have been budgeted
 
05:19:50.410 --> 05:19:50.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:53.628 --> 05:19:53.638 align:start position:0%
any further conversation on this
 
05:19:58.788 --> 05:19:58.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:58.798 --> 05:20:00.288 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:20:00.288 --> 05:20:00.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:20:05.208 --> 05:20:05.218 align:start position:0%
okay so we're down a member
 
05:20:05.218 --> 05:20:06.788 align:start position:0%
okay so we're down a member
um

05:20:06.788 --> 05:20:06.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:20:11.270 --> 05:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
so a really really informal struggle uh
 
05:20:13.730 --> 05:20:13.740 align:start position:0%
on for 237
 
05:20:16.970 --> 05:20:16.980 align:start position:0%
I the first raise your hands if you're
 
05:20:19.250 --> 05:20:19.260 align:start position:0%
in favor of keeping
 
05:20:22.368 --> 05:20:22.378 align:start position:0%
this hp2 item as is with no changes
 
05:20:25.670 --> 05:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:28.610 --> 05:20:28.620 align:start position:0%
okay no so it's unanimous
 
05:20:32.330 --> 05:20:32.340 align:start position:0%
um all right so 239
 
05:20:34.670 --> 05:20:34.680 align:start position:0%
audit of the integrated eligibility
 
05:20:34.680 --> 05:20:43.368 align:start position:0%
audit of the integrated eligibility
system

05:20:43.368 --> 05:20:43.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:49.610 --> 05:20:49.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:52.310 --> 05:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
but the name New Heights isn't on here
 
05:20:53.990 --> 05:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
it doesn't need to be if it's the
 
05:20:55.850 --> 05:20:55.860 align:start position:0%
eligibility system I'm just trying to
 
05:21:03.230 --> 05:21:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:05.750 --> 05:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
05:21:07.910 --> 05:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
let's have a little discussion of this
 
05:21:11.330 --> 05:21:11.340 align:start position:0%
like we did mmis thinking that all of
 
05:21:14.208 --> 05:21:14.218 align:start position:0%
the concepts are understood
 
05:21:16.368 --> 05:21:16.378 align:start position:0%
is this a good candidate for what we
 
05:21:18.708 --> 05:21:18.718 align:start position:0%
just did with mmis where we want to go
 
05:21:23.270 --> 05:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
ahead and keep the s or the 23 funds but
 
05:21:28.070 --> 05:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
this 838 really is operations and
 
05:21:28.080 --> 05:21:29.810 align:start position:0%
this 838 really is operations and
maintenance

05:21:29.810 --> 05:21:29.820 align:start position:0%
maintenance
 
05:21:33.708 --> 05:21:33.718 align:start position:0%
it's a one-time cost every two years
 
05:21:36.970 --> 05:21:36.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:39.050 --> 05:21:39.060 align:start position:0%
that's funny
 
05:21:39.060 --> 05:21:41.448 align:start position:0%
that's funny
okay

05:21:41.448 --> 05:21:41.458 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:21:41.458 --> 05:21:42.890 align:start position:0%
okay
so

05:21:42.890 --> 05:21:42.900 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:21:44.930 --> 05:21:44.940 align:start position:0%
um that I don't know that feels like
 
05:21:46.910 --> 05:21:46.920 align:start position:0%
operations are maintenance to me if it's
 
05:21:51.230 --> 05:21:51.240 align:start position:0%
if it's got such a rhythm so so would
 
05:21:55.250 --> 05:21:55.260 align:start position:0%
would we should we do what Mr Ripple did
 
05:21:58.750 --> 05:21:58.760 align:start position:0%
with an hb2 and one Amendment to
 
05:22:03.288 --> 05:22:03.298 align:start position:0%
operationalize the 832 what do you think
 
05:22:06.050 --> 05:22:06.060 align:start position:0%
that that that's one option
 
05:22:07.910 --> 05:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
what what do you think Mr Ripple since
 
05:22:10.190 --> 05:22:10.200 align:start position:0%
you would do the work I think that's
 
05:22:11.628 --> 05:22:11.638 align:start position:0%
fine if that's what the division wants
 
05:22:14.510 --> 05:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
to do all right so that's that's what
 
05:22:16.250 --> 05:22:16.260 align:start position:0%
I'd prefer to do because we then we can
 
05:22:17.570 --> 05:22:17.580 align:start position:0%
be consistent we're trying to
 
05:22:20.510 --> 05:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
operationalize costs and we're we're but
 
05:22:22.550 --> 05:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
we want to take advantage of the 23
 
05:22:26.510 --> 05:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
excess so is there anyone who's opposed
 
05:22:26.520 --> 05:22:28.430 align:start position:0%
excess so is there anyone who's opposed
to

05:22:28.430 --> 05:22:28.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:22:31.788 --> 05:22:31.798 align:start position:0%
putting the operations money into hb1
 
05:22:35.030 --> 05:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
instead of leaving an hb2 a
 
05:22:36.590 --> 05:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
representative or if I'm curious what
 
05:22:39.170 --> 05:22:39.180 align:start position:0%
you're thinking is well you keep
 
05:22:41.150 --> 05:22:41.160 align:start position:0%
reminding us how how busy Miss Ripple is
 
05:22:43.190 --> 05:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
and I know he's busy it just seems you
 
05:22:44.690 --> 05:22:44.700 align:start position:0%
know for such a small sum of money
 
05:22:46.610 --> 05:22:46.620 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem worth making the effort
 
05:22:49.070 --> 05:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
I'll let him speak but because he's done
 
05:22:52.430 --> 05:22:52.440 align:start position:0%
this with mmis this is probably not as
 
05:22:54.050 --> 05:22:54.060 align:start position:0%
much time
 
05:22:55.550 --> 05:22:55.560 align:start position:0%
didn't take too long I would suggest
 
05:22:56.868 --> 05:22:56.878 align:start position:0%
that since the number is so small
 
05:22:59.030 --> 05:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
compared to the 20.5 million for Mis
 
05:23:01.490 --> 05:23:01.500 align:start position:0%
that you could just fund it out of 24.25
 
05:23:03.770 --> 05:23:03.780 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't need to use this so we
 
05:23:06.170 --> 05:23:06.180 align:start position:0%
don't need to worry about the 23 money I
 
05:23:08.150 --> 05:23:08.160 align:start position:0%
don't think so just put it in an hb1 I
 
05:23:09.890 --> 05:23:09.900 align:start position:0%
think so
 
05:23:13.430 --> 05:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
so we might be able to apply that 23
 
05:23:15.590 --> 05:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
money to something else
 
05:23:21.830 --> 05:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:24.050 --> 05:23:24.060 align:start position:0%
um what do you think about that that
 
05:23:25.910 --> 05:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
sounds good
 
05:23:28.910 --> 05:23:28.920 align:start position:0%
Okay so we've just changed we're not
 
05:23:31.310 --> 05:23:31.320 align:start position:0%
going to fund this 830 million or a
 
05:23:32.930 --> 05:23:32.940 align:start position:0%
thousand out of
 
05:23:36.288 --> 05:23:36.298 align:start position:0%
uh 23 money we're gonna use current ex
 
05:23:39.948 --> 05:23:39.958 align:start position:0%
money and then this 23 money we're going
 
05:23:41.330 --> 05:23:41.340 align:start position:0%
to keep track of because it could be
 
05:23:42.948 --> 05:23:42.958 align:start position:0%
applied elsewhere
 
05:23:46.430 --> 05:23:46.440 align:start position:0%
yes okay all in favor of it does
 
05:23:47.868 --> 05:23:47.878 align:start position:0%
everyone understand what we're talking
 
05:23:50.090 --> 05:23:50.100 align:start position:0%
about because we that was a conversation
 
05:23:54.230 --> 05:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
not a question so if you if you are okay
 
05:23:57.470 --> 05:23:57.480 align:start position:0%
with that conversation raise your hand
 
05:24:01.610 --> 05:24:01.620 align:start position:0%
opposed no one okay good thank you
 
05:24:03.770 --> 05:24:03.780 align:start position:0%
so now we're on
 
05:24:03.780 --> 05:24:06.590 align:start position:0%
so now we're on
239

05:24:06.590 --> 05:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
239
 
05:24:06.600 --> 05:24:09.230 align:start position:0%
239
um

05:24:09.230 --> 05:24:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:12.050 --> 05:24:12.060 align:start position:0%
audit oh wait that sounds we just did
 
05:24:15.170 --> 05:24:15.180 align:start position:0%
that no wonder let's look familiar
 
05:24:15.180 --> 05:24:17.628 align:start position:0%
that no wonder let's look familiar
241.

05:24:17.628 --> 05:24:17.638 align:start position:0%
241.
 
05:24:20.628 --> 05:24:20.638 align:start position:0%
this section appropriates 533 000
 
05:24:24.050 --> 05:24:24.060 align:start position:0%
General funds from 23 for the purpose of
 
05:24:26.810 --> 05:24:26.820 align:start position:0%
moving one district office okay so this
 
05:24:29.208 --> 05:24:29.218 align:start position:0%
is an even smaller amount of money so
 
05:24:31.788 --> 05:24:31.798 align:start position:0%
why are we wanting to use 23 money for
 
05:24:34.910 --> 05:24:34.920 align:start position:0%
this this is truly one time because this
 
05:24:37.490 --> 05:24:37.500 align:start position:0%
is meant to be one time
 
05:24:37.500 --> 05:24:42.170 align:start position:0%
is meant to be one time
foreign

05:24:42.170 --> 05:24:42.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:44.990 --> 05:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
05:24:47.570 --> 05:24:47.580 align:start position:0%
just leave it as is is the thing to do
 
05:24:51.410 --> 05:24:51.420 align:start position:0%
right okay uh raise your hand if you
 
05:24:54.708 --> 05:24:54.718 align:start position:0%
think we should leave 241 as is
 
05:24:58.310 --> 05:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:00.010 --> 05:25:00.020 align:start position:0%
two four three
 
05:25:03.288 --> 05:25:03.298 align:start position:0%
appropriates 200 000 of General funds
 
05:25:05.690 --> 05:25:05.700 align:start position:0%
from the past into the future to replace
 
05:25:07.970 --> 05:25:07.980 align:start position:0%
two vehicles which will not pass
 
05:25:10.368 --> 05:25:10.378 align:start position:0%
inspection and outdated clinical
 
05:25:10.378 --> 05:25:11.330 align:start position:0%
inspection and outdated clinical
equipment

05:25:11.330 --> 05:25:11.340 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
05:25:13.368 --> 05:25:13.378 align:start position:0%
it just always bugged me that I never
 
05:25:15.590 --> 05:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
saw the description of the vehicles or
 
05:25:18.050 --> 05:25:18.060 align:start position:0%
the equipment and the 200 000 feels like
 
05:25:20.990 --> 05:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of money but that's okay that's
 
05:25:25.128 --> 05:25:25.138 align:start position:0%
not a yes or no vote issue but um I
 
05:25:28.610 --> 05:25:28.620 align:start position:0%
don't think uh is there any opposition
 
05:25:32.810 --> 05:25:32.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:34.610 --> 05:25:34.620 align:start position:0%
representative hole
 
05:25:37.070 --> 05:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
what's your opposition other than we
 
05:25:41.270 --> 05:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:42.830 --> 05:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
is that all
 
05:25:45.170 --> 05:25:45.180 align:start position:0%
right representative Earth do you have
 
05:25:47.570 --> 05:25:47.580 align:start position:0%
anything to add to that
 
05:25:49.368 --> 05:25:49.378 align:start position:0%
I'm totally supportive
 
05:25:52.128 --> 05:25:52.138 align:start position:0%
of it as written as written with big
 
05:25:52.138 --> 05:25:58.128 align:start position:0%
of it as written as written with big
caddies

05:25:58.128 --> 05:25:58.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:00.590 --> 05:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
it probably is well I when I first read
 
05:26:02.448 --> 05:26:02.458 align:start position:0%
this I circled the vehicles and I was
 
05:26:03.708 --> 05:26:03.718 align:start position:0%
thinking that's a whole lot of money for
 
05:26:05.448 --> 05:26:05.458 align:start position:0%
vehicles but my mind flipped right over
 
05:26:07.190 --> 05:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
the part that says clinical equipment so
 
05:26:08.990 --> 05:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
that actually makes me feel better yeah
 
05:26:11.448 --> 05:26:11.458 align:start position:0%
so I'm good with it yeah but we're still
 
05:26:13.190 --> 05:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
just as ignorant as we were because we
 
05:26:14.930 --> 05:26:14.940 align:start position:0%
don't know what they are we just feel
 
05:26:18.610 --> 05:26:18.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:21.530 --> 05:26:21.540 align:start position:0%
it would be better if it was so much for
 
05:26:23.930 --> 05:26:23.940 align:start position:0%
vehicles and so much for equipment for
 
05:26:25.610 --> 05:26:25.620 align:start position:0%
clarity okay but the issue is we're not
 
05:26:28.310 --> 05:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
going to change this hb2 item if if you
 
05:26:29.990 --> 05:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
have time it would be nice to know what
 
05:26:31.970 --> 05:26:31.980 align:start position:0%
we're doing with the money though
 
05:26:33.350 --> 05:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:26:37.128 --> 05:26:37.138 align:start position:0%
uh do do do do do do we have do we need
 
05:26:38.750 --> 05:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
to vote on that that seemed pretty
 
05:26:40.310 --> 05:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
obvious all right raise your hand if
 
05:26:42.770 --> 05:26:42.780 align:start position:0%
you're in favor of leaving it alone
 
05:26:42.780 --> 05:26:45.170 align:start position:0%
you're in favor of leaving it alone
Department

05:26:45.170 --> 05:26:45.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:48.110 --> 05:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
okay we'll have about well I think we've
 
05:26:52.368 --> 05:26:52.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:55.490 --> 05:26:55.500 align:start position:0%
they are fire trucks unbelievable you
 
05:26:57.110 --> 05:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
can't touch a fire truck for two hundred
 
05:27:01.150 --> 05:27:01.160 align:start position:0%
thousand so so uh we're on two four five
 
05:27:03.830 --> 05:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
so we're taking old money
 
05:27:08.750 --> 05:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
to support it systems design
 
05:27:11.930 --> 05:27:11.940 align:start position:0%
that that can be one-time money
 
05:27:13.730 --> 05:27:13.740 align:start position:0%
um it's something you should always have
 
05:27:15.948 --> 05:27:15.958 align:start position:0%
a capacity to do but you can do one-time
 
05:27:18.230 --> 05:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
projects on that well you may recall
 
05:27:22.430 --> 05:27:22.440 align:start position:0%
that this is a new model for them these
 
05:27:24.890 --> 05:27:24.900 align:start position:0%
that's both these 245 and 247 together
 
05:27:27.708 --> 05:27:27.718 align:start position:0%
yeah and if it's successful which I'm
 
05:27:29.868 --> 05:27:29.878 align:start position:0%
sure it will be then as they'll continue
 
05:27:31.670 --> 05:27:31.680 align:start position:0%
using if they continue using this model
 
05:27:33.288 --> 05:27:33.298 align:start position:0%
they said they would be separating the
 
05:27:36.530 --> 05:27:36.540 align:start position:0%
budget okay so that sounds to me like
 
05:27:38.448 --> 05:27:38.458 align:start position:0%
you're in favor of leaving the language
 
05:27:39.770 --> 05:27:39.780 align:start position:0%
as is
 
05:27:41.690 --> 05:27:41.700 align:start position:0%
I am totally in favor of that for both
 
05:27:43.670 --> 05:27:43.680 align:start position:0%
of these is there any opposition to
 
05:27:49.010 --> 05:27:49.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:52.250 --> 05:27:52.260 align:start position:0%
not seeing any let's raise your hand if
 
05:27:57.288 --> 05:27:57.298 align:start position:0%
you are in favor of 245 247 as is that
 
05:27:59.770 --> 05:27:59.780 align:start position:0%
that's unanimous okay
 
05:28:04.490 --> 05:28:04.500 align:start position:0%
so now we are on two four nine and and
 
05:28:06.410 --> 05:28:06.420 align:start position:0%
Mr Ripple if you wouldn't mind thinking
 
05:28:09.170 --> 05:28:09.180 align:start position:0%
about when we hit the bottom of this
 
05:28:12.288 --> 05:28:12.298 align:start position:0%
list we we have what two or three brand
 
05:28:14.990 --> 05:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
new things that aren't on this list
 
05:28:15.000 --> 05:28:17.448 align:start position:0%
new things that aren't on this list
and

05:28:17.448 --> 05:28:17.458 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:28:19.430 --> 05:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
there will be a few new items I'm not
 
05:28:21.470 --> 05:28:21.480 align:start position:0%
sure I have them all
 
05:28:25.128 --> 05:28:25.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:27.170 --> 05:28:27.180 align:start position:0%
but I might have a few new items to to
 
05:28:28.430 --> 05:28:28.440 align:start position:0%
add to this when you get to the end yeah
 
05:28:31.430 --> 05:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
okay so for those getting excited that
 
05:28:33.590 --> 05:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
we're really close to the end that we're
 
05:28:35.990 --> 05:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
not so
 
05:28:36.000 --> 05:28:36.650 align:start position:0%
not so
um

05:28:36.650 --> 05:28:36.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:28:41.330 --> 05:28:41.340 align:start position:0%
so two four nine
 
05:28:44.208 --> 05:28:44.218 align:start position:0%
appropriates 125 000 General funds from
 
05:28:47.390 --> 05:28:47.400 align:start position:0%
the past to replace aging Legacy
 
05:28:49.550 --> 05:28:49.560 align:start position:0%
database used for pulling quality
 
05:28:53.330 --> 05:28:53.340 align:start position:0%
samples for food stamp okay I I don't
 
05:28:55.670 --> 05:28:55.680 align:start position:0%
know I just leave it as is
 
05:28:57.890 --> 05:28:57.900 align:start position:0%
yeah all right
 
05:28:59.690 --> 05:28:59.700 align:start position:0%
um I I'm not going to take a straw vote
 
05:29:01.490 --> 05:29:01.500 align:start position:0%
that we've kind of done that one so
 
05:29:04.128 --> 05:29:04.138 align:start position:0%
we're going to keep 249 as is unless
 
05:29:06.350 --> 05:29:06.360 align:start position:0%
somebody tells me no
 
05:29:11.690 --> 05:29:11.700 align:start position:0%
uh 251 appropriates 410 000 in general
 
05:29:15.650 --> 05:29:15.660 align:start position:0%
funds from the past to replace aging
 
05:29:15.660 --> 05:29:16.730 align:start position:0%
funds from the past to replace aging
switches

05:29:16.730 --> 05:29:16.740 align:start position:0%
switches
 
05:29:20.150 --> 05:29:20.160 align:start position:0%
okay so I'm I'm okay with that although
 
05:29:22.970 --> 05:29:22.980 align:start position:0%
I consider switches routers and access
 
05:29:28.010 --> 05:29:28.020 align:start position:0%
points more to be Expendable not durable
 
05:29:30.830 --> 05:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
but um but I'm fine with it does anyone
 
05:29:33.708 --> 05:29:33.718 align:start position:0%
want to change that hb2 item
 
05:29:36.830 --> 05:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
okay so we'll accept the that we'll have
 
05:29:38.990 --> 05:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
new switches and routers
 
05:29:39.000 --> 05:29:41.570 align:start position:0%
new switches and routers
253

05:29:41.570 --> 05:29:41.580 align:start position:0%
253
 
05:29:45.230 --> 05:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
um I have this is a TANF note and I S it
 
05:29:48.470 --> 05:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
my note says we just agreed in principle
 
05:29:51.530 --> 05:29:51.540 align:start position:0%
to move from hb2 to hb1 or at least I
 
05:29:53.570 --> 05:29:53.580 align:start position:0%
thought we had do you want to talk about
 
05:29:53.580 --> 05:29:55.750 align:start position:0%
thought we had do you want to talk about
this

05:29:55.750 --> 05:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:29:58.310 --> 05:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
253 yes we also had an email
 
05:30:01.070 --> 05:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
conversation about this so I prepared an
 
05:30:02.570 --> 05:30:02.580 align:start position:0%
amendment in your name this amendment
 
05:30:03.948 --> 05:30:03.958 align:start position:0%
would actually keep it in-house Bill too
 
05:30:05.750 --> 05:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
but I can hand this around for
 
05:30:07.610 --> 05:30:07.620 align:start position:0%
discussion purposes if you'd like let's
 
05:30:19.868 --> 05:30:19.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:22.850 --> 05:30:22.860 align:start position:0%
this is this is all in an effort to show
 
05:30:25.930 --> 05:30:25.940 align:start position:0%
our our minimum
 
05:30:29.448 --> 05:30:29.458 align:start position:0%
investment right or whatever the term is
 
05:30:40.150 --> 05:30:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:43.070 --> 05:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
okay so I'm looking at this amendment
 
05:30:44.690 --> 05:30:44.700 align:start position:0%
I'm remembering pieces of the
 
05:30:44.700 --> 05:30:46.070 align:start position:0%
I'm remembering pieces of the
conversation

05:30:46.070 --> 05:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
05:30:49.670 --> 05:30:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:52.070 --> 05:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
we are obligated to meet a maintenance
 
05:30:54.770 --> 05:30:54.780 align:start position:0%
of effort in order to get the federal
 
05:30:57.948 --> 05:30:57.958 align:start position:0%
funds and there are sort of penalties in
 
05:31:00.650 --> 05:31:00.660 align:start position:0%
the future if we haven't done that and
 
05:31:03.110 --> 05:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
so our maintenance of effort to me is
 
05:31:05.208 --> 05:31:05.218 align:start position:0%
something that ought to be in hb1
 
05:31:08.150 --> 05:31:08.160 align:start position:0%
because that's essentially our annual
 
05:31:11.990 --> 05:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
buy-in to to be a full member of the
 
05:31:15.230 --> 05:31:15.240 align:start position:0%
TANF Society so
 
05:31:15.240 --> 05:31:16.868 align:start position:0%
TANF Society so
um

05:31:16.868 --> 05:31:16.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:31:21.770 --> 05:31:21.780 align:start position:0%
what the hb2 item 253 did is it made
 
05:31:23.510 --> 05:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
sure that we had the maintenance effort
 
05:31:23.520 --> 05:31:24.410 align:start position:0%
sure that we had the maintenance effort
money

05:31:24.410 --> 05:31:24.420 align:start position:0%
money
 
05:31:27.110 --> 05:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
but it really just ought to be an hb1 so
 
05:31:28.910 --> 05:31:28.920 align:start position:0%
that we can see
 
05:31:31.850 --> 05:31:31.860 align:start position:0%
annually or every two years that this is
 
05:31:34.550 --> 05:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
an issue that we have to fund that's
 
05:31:35.990 --> 05:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
what why I think we're doing this
 
05:31:37.910 --> 05:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
amendment what what did what what else
 
05:31:40.010 --> 05:31:40.020 align:start position:0%
would you say well this also this
 
05:31:42.050 --> 05:31:42.060 align:start position:0%
reduces the appropriation from 3 million
 
05:31:43.368 --> 05:31:43.378 align:start position:0%
per year to five hundred thousand
 
05:31:45.770 --> 05:31:45.780 align:start position:0%
dollars per year oh so there's a five
 
05:31:47.570 --> 05:31:47.580 align:start position:0%
million dollar savings over the two
 
05:31:51.230 --> 05:31:51.240 align:start position:0%
years yes so I had sent out
 
05:31:55.128 --> 05:31:55.138 align:start position:0%
a spreadsheet Nathan gave me of all the
 
05:31:58.010 --> 05:31:58.020 align:start position:0%
TANF funds in the budget and technically
 
05:32:00.590 --> 05:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
based on the budgeted figures the 32
 
05:32:01.850 --> 05:32:01.860 align:start position:0%
million dollar maintenance of effort
 
05:32:03.948 --> 05:32:03.958 align:start position:0%
requirement is met now as as Nathan can
 
05:32:05.810 --> 05:32:05.820 align:start position:0%
point out to you the maintenance of
 
05:32:07.430 --> 05:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
effort is based on expenditures not
 
05:32:09.890 --> 05:32:09.900 align:start position:0%
budgeted figures
 
05:32:12.590 --> 05:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
so this would provide a smaller cushion
 
05:32:13.970 --> 05:32:13.980 align:start position:0%
to five hundred thousand dollars rather
 
05:32:15.170 --> 05:32:15.180 align:start position:0%
than the three million that's currently
 
05:32:17.208 --> 05:32:17.218 align:start position:0%
in the trailer bill
 
05:32:19.070 --> 05:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
so in other words just because we
 
05:32:21.288 --> 05:32:21.298 align:start position:0%
budgeted we we're not really done we
 
05:32:22.730 --> 05:32:22.740 align:start position:0%
still have to spend the money in order
 
05:32:24.650 --> 05:32:24.660 align:start position:0%
to qualify for the maintenance of effort
 
05:32:29.390 --> 05:32:29.400 align:start position:0%
and by having additional funds budgeted
 
05:32:32.390 --> 05:32:32.400 align:start position:0%
we're more likely to actually hit the
 
05:32:34.730 --> 05:32:34.740 align:start position:0%
expenditures that we need in order to
 
05:32:36.230 --> 05:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
meet the maintenance level the
 
05:32:39.770 --> 05:32:39.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:42.830 --> 05:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
yes I think so this just budgets
 
05:32:45.170 --> 05:32:45.180 align:start position:0%
less extra than the yeah than the
 
05:32:47.330 --> 05:32:47.340 align:start position:0%
governor's bucket so so we're we're
 
05:32:50.208 --> 05:32:50.218 align:start position:0%
pairing it back a little bit so we're
 
05:32:52.128 --> 05:32:52.138 align:start position:0%
accepting a little bit of risk with this
 
05:32:55.190 --> 05:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
Mr White what's your perception of the
 
05:32:57.830 --> 05:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
risk that we're increasing because the
 
05:33:01.430 --> 05:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
it's not a budget risk and I and I
 
05:33:03.110 --> 05:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
actually don't see that it could
 
05:33:07.128 --> 05:33:07.138 align:start position:0%
increase the risk of under expending
 
05:33:09.110 --> 05:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
because that's going to happen whether
 
05:33:12.410 --> 05:33:12.420 align:start position:0%
it's 3 million or half a million if
 
05:33:13.490 --> 05:33:13.500 align:start position:0%
you're if you're not going to spend it
 
05:33:15.470 --> 05:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
you're not going to spend it so I think
 
05:33:17.090 --> 05:33:17.100 align:start position:0%
what's really important to point out is
 
05:33:18.948 --> 05:33:18.958 align:start position:0%
that in the document that I had sent you
 
05:33:21.410 --> 05:33:21.420 align:start position:0%
there's 2.8 million dollars of assumed
 
05:33:21.420 --> 05:33:22.970 align:start position:0%
there's 2.8 million dollars of assumed
Revenue

05:33:22.970 --> 05:33:22.980 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
05:33:26.690 --> 05:33:26.700 align:start position:0%
um collected from non-custodial parents
 
05:33:29.150 --> 05:33:29.160 align:start position:0%
um if we don't receive that then I don't
 
05:33:31.070 --> 05:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
have the general funds budgeted to hit
 
05:33:33.230 --> 05:33:33.240 align:start position:0%
the maintenance of effort
 
05:33:35.690 --> 05:33:35.700 align:start position:0%
um the other the other side of this is
 
05:33:38.628 --> 05:33:38.638 align:start position:0%
the way that we've budgeted that that
 
05:33:40.610 --> 05:33:40.620 align:start position:0%
also assumes that all of those positions
 
05:33:42.590 --> 05:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
will be filled so that we would hit that
 
05:33:45.170 --> 05:33:45.180 align:start position:0%
we know that life happens and we'll
 
05:33:46.670 --> 05:33:46.680 align:start position:0%
probably lose people we'll probably hire
 
05:33:49.310 --> 05:33:49.320 align:start position:0%
people during that time frame the reason
 
05:33:51.650 --> 05:33:51.660 align:start position:0%
just from a uh just so everybody
 
05:33:54.788 --> 05:33:54.798 align:start position:0%
understands why this came in through a
 
05:33:57.708 --> 05:33:57.718 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs request is because in
 
05:34:00.170 --> 05:34:00.180 align:start position:0%
order to hit the three percent
 
05:34:01.670 --> 05:34:01.680 align:start position:0%
um as required by the governor for the
 
05:34:03.550 --> 05:34:03.560 align:start position:0%
efficiency expenditure requests under
 
05:34:07.490 --> 05:34:07.500 align:start position:0%
rsa94 we we were not able to get all of
 
05:34:08.990 --> 05:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
our TANF funds budgeted that came
 
05:34:11.090 --> 05:34:11.100 align:start position:0%
through during the governor's phase of
 
05:34:12.350 --> 05:34:12.360 align:start position:0%
the budget
 
05:34:14.090 --> 05:34:14.100 align:start position:0%
um we we weren't able to get there and
 
05:34:15.708 --> 05:34:15.718 align:start position:0%
that's why it ended up as an hp2
 
05:34:18.350 --> 05:34:18.360 align:start position:0%
provision to provide us the cushion that
 
05:34:20.030 --> 05:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
that we need and I don't know if cushion
 
05:34:21.490 --> 05:34:21.500 align:start position:0%
is really an appropriate word here
 
05:34:23.868 --> 05:34:23.878 align:start position:0%
because in that document that we have
 
05:34:26.208 --> 05:34:26.218 align:start position:0%
sent there's assumed there's assumed
 
05:34:28.010 --> 05:34:28.020 align:start position:0%
amounts the assumed amounts are never
 
05:34:30.530 --> 05:34:30.540 align:start position:0%
the actual experience so I would be
 
05:34:32.570 --> 05:34:32.580 align:start position:0%
pretty concerned that we may not hit
 
05:34:35.090 --> 05:34:35.100 align:start position:0%
maintenance of effort and we would be we
 
05:34:37.788 --> 05:34:37.798 align:start position:0%
would have fewer funds fewer TANF funds
 
05:34:40.490 --> 05:34:40.500 align:start position:0%
available in future years
 
05:34:43.310 --> 05:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
not just fewer but we'd be penalized and
 
05:34:47.690 --> 05:34:47.700 align:start position:0%
we'd have TANF additional Tana funds uh
 
05:34:49.570 --> 05:34:49.580 align:start position:0%
prohibited to us
 
05:34:52.670 --> 05:34:52.680 align:start position:0%
correct this isn't just a matching issue
 
05:34:55.128 --> 05:34:55.138 align:start position:0%
this is also a potential penalty issue
 
05:34:55.138 --> 05:34:57.530 align:start position:0%
this is also a potential penalty issue
correct

05:34:57.530 --> 05:34:57.540 align:start position:0%
correct
 
05:34:59.270 --> 05:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
all right representative we'll only have
 
05:35:01.490 --> 05:35:01.500 align:start position:0%
comment on this what do you what do you
 
05:35:03.350 --> 05:35:03.360 align:start position:0%
think well I don't feel comfortable with
 
05:35:07.610 --> 05:35:07.620 align:start position:0%
the 500 000 I mean I I feel like
 
05:35:11.448 --> 05:35:11.458 align:start position:0%
risky to uh not provide the three
 
05:35:13.930 --> 05:35:13.940 align:start position:0%
million it is needed in this line
 
05:35:17.390 --> 05:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
is is it is it the case that the 3
 
05:35:19.250 --> 05:35:19.260 align:start position:0%
million is there because you looked at
 
05:35:21.708 --> 05:35:21.718 align:start position:0%
the 2.8 that we're supposed to get from
 
05:35:25.190 --> 05:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
Collections and you're assuming a risk
 
05:35:28.250 --> 05:35:28.260 align:start position:0%
possibility of zero of the 2.8 so
 
05:35:29.868 --> 05:35:29.878 align:start position:0%
therefore you went with three million
 
05:35:33.650 --> 05:35:33.660 align:start position:0%
what how did I I'm just trying to
 
05:35:35.810 --> 05:35:35.820 align:start position:0%
understand your confidence level on the
 
05:35:37.910 --> 05:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
three million is it really 2 million is
 
05:35:40.010 --> 05:35:40.020 align:start position:0%
it a million how did you get to 3
 
05:35:42.650 --> 05:35:42.660 align:start position:0%
million sure so so there's there's the
 
05:35:45.350 --> 05:35:45.360 align:start position:0%
revenue component which which is the 2.8
 
05:35:48.350 --> 05:35:48.360 align:start position:0%
million that that we have assumed but
 
05:35:50.270 --> 05:35:50.280 align:start position:0%
then there's the actual spend because
 
05:35:53.270 --> 05:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
the budgeted amounts they matter but
 
05:35:55.010 --> 05:35:55.020 align:start position:0%
from a maintenance of effort actual
 
05:35:58.030 --> 05:35:58.040 align:start position:0%
spend perspective they don't matter so
 
05:36:01.250 --> 05:36:01.260 align:start position:0%
what what we would likely you know if if
 
05:36:03.288 --> 05:36:03.298 align:start position:0%
we were to receive that three million we
 
05:36:04.788 --> 05:36:04.798 align:start position:0%
had vacancies in our positions or
 
05:36:07.128 --> 05:36:07.138 align:start position:0%
whatever it might be or we had we didn't
 
05:36:08.570 --> 05:36:08.580 align:start position:0%
collect all of those revenues that we
 
05:36:10.850 --> 05:36:10.860 align:start position:0%
had anticipated we would likely have to
 
05:36:12.770 --> 05:36:12.780 align:start position:0%
spend those dollars in cash assistance
 
05:36:14.390 --> 05:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
and we wouldn't spend the federal funds
 
05:36:17.868 --> 05:36:17.878 align:start position:0%
that we have in the cash assistance line
 
05:36:21.170 --> 05:36:21.180 align:start position:0%
so if you're are you just to clarify are
 
05:36:24.490 --> 05:36:24.500 align:start position:0%
are you are you looking for what is
 
05:36:28.490 --> 05:36:28.500 align:start position:0%
what is a a slightly lower risk dollar
 
05:36:31.310 --> 05:36:31.320 align:start position:0%
figure yeah I'm trying I'm trying to
 
05:36:33.288 --> 05:36:33.298 align:start position:0%
make sure I understand all the mental
 
05:36:35.510 --> 05:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
terms you know gymnastics you've had to
 
05:36:37.910 --> 05:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
jump through that led you to 3 million
 
05:36:40.368 --> 05:36:40.378 align:start position:0%
and I'm just basically challenge you to
 
05:36:43.430 --> 05:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
go through your gymnastics and figure is
 
05:36:45.590 --> 05:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
three million actually a little Rich
 
05:36:47.948 --> 05:36:47.958 align:start position:0%
could you would two million really
 
05:36:50.750 --> 05:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
compensate for what you think the real
 
05:36:54.050 --> 05:36:54.060 align:start position:0%
risk is here you did you did the thought
 
05:36:56.448 --> 05:36:56.458 align:start position:0%
so I'm just asking you what your gut
 
05:36:59.330 --> 05:36:59.340 align:start position:0%
tells you is it a solid 3 million or
 
05:37:01.250 --> 05:37:01.260 align:start position:0%
could you do with less and still feel
 
05:37:01.260 --> 05:37:03.470 align:start position:0%
could you do with less and still feel
comfortable

05:37:03.470 --> 05:37:03.480 align:start position:0%
comfortable
 
05:37:05.330 --> 05:37:05.340 align:start position:0%
I think what I would need to do to
 
05:37:07.250 --> 05:37:07.260 align:start position:0%
really feel comfortable is to take a
 
05:37:09.470 --> 05:37:09.480 align:start position:0%
closer look this weekend at the
 
05:37:11.930 --> 05:37:11.940 align:start position:0%
Historical spend and talk it over with
 
05:37:13.128 --> 05:37:13.138 align:start position:0%
the team
 
05:37:13.138 --> 05:37:13.750 align:start position:0%
the team
um

05:37:13.750 --> 05:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:37:17.390 --> 05:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
to be because again I I don't you know
 
05:37:20.208 --> 05:37:20.218 align:start position:0%
from a state perspective I don't want to
 
05:37:23.390 --> 05:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
put our TANF funds our our federal TANF
 
05:37:25.550 --> 05:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
funds at risk
 
05:37:27.890 --> 05:37:27.900 align:start position:0%
um so let let me take that back and take
 
05:37:30.770 --> 05:37:30.780 align:start position:0%
a closer look at it to understand
 
05:37:32.810 --> 05:37:32.820 align:start position:0%
um where where we could get to that
 
05:37:35.208 --> 05:37:35.218 align:start position:0%
would still you know satisfy that need I
 
05:37:37.128 --> 05:37:37.138 align:start position:0%
also recognize the challenge that this
 
05:37:38.810 --> 05:37:38.820 align:start position:0%
committee has and the full Finance has
 
05:37:40.670 --> 05:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
with with balancing the budget and I'll
 
05:37:42.410 --> 05:37:42.420 align:start position:0%
I'll take that back and take a closer
 
05:37:43.788 --> 05:37:43.798 align:start position:0%
look at that to make sure we can get
 
05:37:45.350 --> 05:37:45.360 align:start position:0%
somewhere we can all agree to that would
 
05:37:47.628 --> 05:37:47.638 align:start position:0%
be great I I can wait till Monday to
 
05:37:49.190 --> 05:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
have the rest of that conversation is
 
05:37:50.690 --> 05:37:50.700 align:start position:0%
there any other discussion or questions
 
05:37:54.890 --> 05:37:54.900 align:start position:0%
that you'd like to ask here anyone all
 
05:37:54.900 --> 05:37:56.510 align:start position:0%
that you'd like to ask here anyone all
right

05:37:56.510 --> 05:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:38:00.230 --> 05:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
um so I guess we got this on hold
 
05:38:04.128 --> 05:38:04.138 align:start position:0%
and then we're on 254 probation a
 
05:38:07.010 --> 05:38:07.020 align:start position:0%
million and the biennium for family you
 
05:38:09.350 --> 05:38:09.360 align:start position:0%
know I know I don't maybe I got sent I
 
05:38:11.270 --> 05:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
didn't I don't recall ever seeing a
 
05:38:15.530 --> 05:38:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:20.050 --> 05:38:20.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:22.730 --> 05:38:22.740 align:start position:0%
I think I sent it out
 
05:38:26.990 --> 05:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:27.000 --> 05:38:31.570 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:38:31.570 --> 05:38:31.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:37.368 --> 05:38:37.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:39.410 --> 05:38:39.420 align:start position:0%
email from Mr White
 
05:38:40.910 --> 05:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
Family Resource Centers are
 
05:38:42.830 --> 05:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
community-based resource hubs for
 
05:38:44.868 --> 05:38:44.878 align:start position:0%
families where they can receive formal
 
05:38:47.448 --> 05:38:47.458 align:start position:0%
and informal support to promote family
 
05:38:49.788 --> 05:38:49.798 align:start position:0%
strengthening and well-being
 
05:38:52.430 --> 05:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
then there's a link to an RSA that gives
 
05:38:54.470 --> 05:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
the wellness and primary prevention
 
05:38:56.750 --> 05:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
counsel the responsibility to designate
 
05:38:59.030 --> 05:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
Family Resource Centers as quality
 
05:39:00.650 --> 05:39:00.660 align:start position:0%
Family Resource Centers
 
05:39:04.670 --> 05:39:04.680 align:start position:0%
and then two links with more information
 
05:39:06.770 --> 05:39:06.780 align:start position:0%
so do these Family Resource Centers
 
05:39:10.490 --> 05:39:10.500 align:start position:0%
operate under contract from DHHS or do
 
05:39:13.010 --> 05:39:13.020 align:start position:0%
they come they do they come through as
 
05:39:14.810 --> 05:39:14.820 align:start position:0%
vendors to us
 
05:39:17.330 --> 05:39:17.340 align:start position:0%
yeah we we would contract those those
 
05:39:19.208 --> 05:39:19.218 align:start position:0%
funds out so so the original
 
05:39:21.530 --> 05:39:21.540 align:start position:0%
appropriation that the department
 
05:39:25.730 --> 05:39:25.740 align:start position:0%
received was through SB 44 444 from this
 
05:39:27.590 --> 05:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
past legislative session and the reason
 
05:39:30.230 --> 05:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
that the department submitted uh
 
05:39:32.030 --> 05:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs requests in the amount
 
05:39:34.310 --> 05:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
of 1 million General funds in state
 
05:39:36.350 --> 05:39:36.360 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 24 and 1 million in state
 
05:39:39.590 --> 05:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 25 was to continue the
 
05:39:41.628 --> 05:39:41.638 align:start position:0%
appropriation levels that the
 
05:39:43.190 --> 05:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
legislature had authorize this past
 
05:39:45.470 --> 05:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
session you have to leave soon do you
 
05:39:47.110 --> 05:39:47.120 align:start position:0%
have something
 
05:39:51.110 --> 05:39:51.120 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to help okay so this is
 
05:39:54.470 --> 05:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
a particular pilot program that the
 
05:39:56.570 --> 05:39:56.580 align:start position:0%
Senate set up
 
05:39:56.580 --> 05:39:57.948 align:start position:0%
Senate set up
and

05:39:57.948 --> 05:39:57.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:40:01.250 --> 05:40:01.260 align:start position:0%
I would suggest we take it out
 
05:40:04.670 --> 05:40:04.680 align:start position:0%
and let them put it back in
 
05:40:07.070 --> 05:40:07.080 align:start position:0%
so we can deal with them well because we
 
05:40:08.990 --> 05:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
have other uses it's basically funding
 
05:40:10.670 --> 05:40:10.680 align:start position:0%
related to I mean it's not specifically
 
05:40:12.110 --> 05:40:12.120 align:start position:0%
related to Medicaid but it is that kind
 
05:40:13.730 --> 05:40:13.740 align:start position:0%
of thing it's basically a behavioral
 
05:40:16.128 --> 05:40:16.138 align:start position:0%
health program for kids and not that
 
05:40:18.650 --> 05:40:18.660 align:start position:0%
it's a bad thing but given all of our
 
05:40:20.330 --> 05:40:20.340 align:start position:0%
demands here being I said we'd look at
 
05:40:21.890 --> 05:40:21.900 align:start position:0%
all of them and I think in one big
 
05:40:23.570 --> 05:40:23.580 align:start position:0%
bucket whenever we finally get to it and
 
05:40:25.250 --> 05:40:25.260 align:start position:0%
this could be could be part of that
 
05:40:27.470 --> 05:40:27.480 align:start position:0%
bucket or just put it on hold for the
 
05:40:29.570 --> 05:40:29.580 align:start position:0%
moment but basically
 
05:40:33.830 --> 05:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
um I like when the Senate has to work
 
05:40:36.410 --> 05:40:36.420 align:start position:0%
when we give them a budget
 
05:40:39.410 --> 05:40:39.420 align:start position:0%
because our job is Pretty Tough well
 
05:40:41.390 --> 05:40:41.400 align:start position:0%
this one's easy for them too if they put
 
05:40:43.490 --> 05:40:43.500 align:start position:0%
it in and we took it out they could find
 
05:40:45.830 --> 05:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
more money and put it back in
 
05:40:51.850 --> 05:40:51.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:55.730 --> 05:40:55.740 align:start position:0%
Mr Ripple I think has a list no no don't
 
05:40:58.670 --> 05:40:58.680 align:start position:0%
give to put back in because we took them
 
05:41:02.810 --> 05:41:02.820 align:start position:0%
out right Mr Ripple works for the Senate
 
05:41:07.788 --> 05:41:07.798 align:start position:0%
as well so it's it's he's got it
 
05:41:11.150 --> 05:41:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:13.628 --> 05:41:13.638 align:start position:0%
I think what you're proposing at least
 
05:41:15.948 --> 05:41:15.958 align:start position:0%
you want to hold it or do you want to
 
05:41:18.288 --> 05:41:18.298 align:start position:0%
propose removing it I I know I'd hold it
 
05:41:20.030 --> 05:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
as part of the bigger discussion of what
 
05:41:21.110 --> 05:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
we're going to do with Medicaid funding
 
05:41:23.510 --> 05:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
I'm good withhold yeah I just want to
 
05:41:25.070 --> 05:41:25.080 align:start position:0%
point out this has to do with preventing
 
05:41:27.110 --> 05:41:27.120 align:start position:0%
child abuse and neglect so I would like
 
05:41:29.330 --> 05:41:29.340 align:start position:0%
much more discussion on it before we do
 
05:41:31.310 --> 05:41:31.320 align:start position:0%
anything that removes well this doesn't
 
05:41:33.708 --> 05:41:33.718 align:start position:0%
kill the FRC program this just is this
 
05:41:35.030 --> 05:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
one particular thing which by the way
 
05:41:37.190 --> 05:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
there's some requirements for reporting
 
05:41:39.110 --> 05:41:39.120 align:start position:0%
which I grant you they're not due until
 
05:41:40.730 --> 05:41:40.740 align:start position:0%
later this year but you would have
 
05:41:41.750 --> 05:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
thought by now they would have had some
 
05:41:43.250 --> 05:41:43.260 align:start position:0%
reporting on this you know supposedly
 
05:41:46.070 --> 05:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
hot program and just to be clear
 
05:41:48.770 --> 05:41:48.780 align:start position:0%
from the Dark Side this isn't an intent
 
05:41:52.190 --> 05:41:52.200 align:start position:0%
to not do the million it's the the dance
 
05:41:55.430 --> 05:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
that's typical here is we have less
 
05:41:57.708 --> 05:41:57.718 align:start position:0%
money to play with than the Senate
 
05:41:59.750 --> 05:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
because their estimates come later when
 
05:42:01.610 --> 05:42:01.620 align:start position:0%
there's more money since this is
 
05:42:03.530 --> 05:42:03.540 align:start position:0%
something that they own they would
 
05:42:06.350 --> 05:42:06.360 align:start position:0%
likely put this back but when we put
 
05:42:08.270 --> 05:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
this budget together and go to the floor
 
05:42:10.070 --> 05:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
looking for votes
 
05:42:12.830 --> 05:42:12.840 align:start position:0%
our budget is a little bit smaller so if
 
05:42:14.810 --> 05:42:14.820 align:start position:0%
it helps us get through that wicket
 
05:42:17.510 --> 05:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
it still doesn't hurt the process I
 
05:42:18.948 --> 05:42:18.958 align:start position:0%
understand the need to thread the needle
 
05:42:21.770 --> 05:42:21.780 align:start position:0%
here I just before we jump to anything I
 
05:42:24.590 --> 05:42:24.600 align:start position:0%
I guess I personally would like to read
 
05:42:27.530 --> 05:42:27.540 align:start position:0%
more about it to make sure that I'm not
 
05:42:30.650 --> 05:42:30.660 align:start position:0%
asked why I am going to cut a line item
 
05:42:32.510 --> 05:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
for something that prevents neglect and
 
05:42:34.550 --> 05:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
child abuse that's it we can discuss it
 
05:42:36.530 --> 05:42:36.540 align:start position:0%
on Monday I'm pretty sure we're all
 
05:42:39.590 --> 05:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
anti-child abuse yes okay
 
05:42:39.600 --> 05:42:41.730 align:start position:0%
anti-child abuse yes okay
so

05:42:41.730 --> 05:42:41.740 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:42:41.740 --> 05:42:42.050 align:start position:0%
so
[Music]

05:42:42.050 --> 05:42:42.060 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:42:42.060 --> 05:42:43.368 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

05:42:43.368 --> 05:42:43.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:42:47.330 --> 05:42:47.340 align:start position:0%
okay so that gets us to the bottom of
 
05:42:50.208 --> 05:42:50.218 align:start position:0%
all the uh
 
05:42:53.448 --> 05:42:53.458 align:start position:0%
no no no tell me we're done
 
05:42:56.208 --> 05:42:56.218 align:start position:0%
oh God I got excited
 
05:43:00.670 --> 05:43:00.680 align:start position:0%
all right so we're on 255 Title 20
 
05:43:06.010 --> 05:43:06.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:08.510 --> 05:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
I have the notes that there's a match
 
05:43:11.030 --> 05:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
and this was prioritized spending what
 
05:43:14.930 --> 05:43:14.940 align:start position:0%
what else can you tell us Mr Ripple
 
05:43:22.368 --> 05:43:22.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:24.170 --> 05:43:24.180 align:start position:0%
if I remember correctly this just keeps
 
05:43:26.030 --> 05:43:26.040 align:start position:0%
the flat funding of what we're paying
 
05:43:30.650 --> 05:43:30.660 align:start position:0%
now no it does more than that it it this
 
05:43:32.868 --> 05:43:32.878 align:start position:0%
when we went into the pandemic we had
 
05:43:34.788 --> 05:43:34.798 align:start position:0%
extra Federal money that we knew was
 
05:43:36.770 --> 05:43:36.780 align:start position:0%
going to go away and we told everyone
 
05:43:38.628 --> 05:43:38.638 align:start position:0%
when we gave them extra Federal money
 
05:43:40.730 --> 05:43:40.740 align:start position:0%
don't get used to this extra Federal
 
05:43:43.430 --> 05:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
money well this is us with the extra
 
05:43:46.548 --> 05:43:46.558 align:start position:0%
Federal money going away coming back and
 
05:43:48.470 --> 05:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
replacing that with General funds
 
05:43:50.628 --> 05:43:50.638 align:start position:0%
despite the warnings that the money
 
05:43:52.788 --> 05:43:52.798 align:start position:0%
wasn't going to continue after the
 
05:43:56.750 --> 05:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
federal funding was gone so so
 
05:43:59.208 --> 05:43:59.218 align:start position:0%
um at least that's the way I remember
 
05:44:01.250 --> 05:44:01.260 align:start position:0%
this is this is it did I say anything
 
05:44:04.850 --> 05:44:04.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:07.250 --> 05:44:07.260 align:start position:0%
you you would say it different but the
 
05:44:11.030 --> 05:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:13.128 --> 05:44:13.138 align:start position:0%
I I would ask Nathan again to weigh in
 
05:44:16.970 --> 05:44:16.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:20.628 --> 05:44:20.638 align:start position:0%
sure so we did receive arpa funds they
 
05:44:22.628 --> 05:44:22.638 align:start position:0%
were used to increase the mill rate from
 
05:44:27.590 --> 05:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
6.65 cents to 8.11 cents this provision
 
05:44:30.530 --> 05:44:30.540 align:start position:0%
would keep those at the current rate
 
05:44:32.510 --> 05:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
um without without the additional funds
 
05:44:34.310 --> 05:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
we'd either reduce the rate or reduce
 
05:44:34.320 --> 05:44:37.490 align:start position:0%
we'd either reduce the rate or reduce
services

05:44:37.490 --> 05:44:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:40.070 --> 05:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
so we're not we're not really replacing
 
05:44:42.048 --> 05:44:42.058 align:start position:0%
the ARP of money wait a second yeah
 
05:44:43.670 --> 05:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
we're still replacing our we're
 
05:44:46.430 --> 05:44:46.440 align:start position:0%
replacing funds yeah yes okay go ahead
 
05:44:46.440 --> 05:44:47.868 align:start position:0%
replacing funds yeah yes okay go ahead
representative

05:44:47.868 --> 05:44:47.878 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:44:47.878 --> 05:44:48.770 align:start position:0%
representative
foreign

05:44:48.770 --> 05:44:48.780 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
05:44:50.990 --> 05:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
I remember hearing something about a ten
 
05:44:52.490 --> 05:44:52.500 align:start position:0%
dollar rate was that an additional
 
05:44:54.350 --> 05:44:54.360 align:start position:0%
request or was that buried in this one
 
05:44:56.570 --> 05:44:56.580 align:start position:0%
as well ten dollars per meal
 
05:44:58.970 --> 05:44:58.980 align:start position:0%
I can talk to that the ten dollars came
 
05:45:01.128 --> 05:45:01.138 align:start position:0%
out of the uh prioritized list or
 
05:45:02.448 --> 05:45:02.458 align:start position:0%
whatever we want to call it that came
 
05:45:05.628 --> 05:45:05.638 align:start position:0%
from outside okay so that was moving the
 
05:45:10.128 --> 05:45:10.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:12.410 --> 05:45:12.420 align:start position:0%
Nathan when did they when did they
 
05:45:15.530 --> 05:45:15.540 align:start position:0%
actually get the arpa funds
 
05:45:18.770 --> 05:45:18.780 align:start position:0%
do you know I I wasn't in my role so I
 
05:45:20.390 --> 05:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
don't I didn't experience it so I don't
 
05:45:22.610 --> 05:45:22.620 align:start position:0%
know the exact date but at some point
 
05:45:24.530 --> 05:45:24.540 align:start position:0%
during this current biennium I believe
 
05:45:27.048 --> 05:45:27.058 align:start position:0%
in the first year in the first year
 
05:45:28.788 --> 05:45:28.798 align:start position:0%
so they've had them
 
05:45:31.128 --> 05:45:31.138 align:start position:0%
all the way through this this biennium
 
05:45:31.138 --> 05:45:32.868 align:start position:0%
all the way through this this biennium
yes

05:45:32.868 --> 05:45:32.878 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:45:36.288 --> 05:45:36.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:38.090 --> 05:45:38.100 align:start position:0%
so thank you Mr chair so Mr White you're
 
05:45:39.770 --> 05:45:39.780 align:start position:0%
saying that the meals would continue to
 
05:45:42.470 --> 05:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
be eight dollars and eleven cents in
 
05:45:44.150 --> 05:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
this particular section is that what you
 
05:45:47.448 --> 05:45:47.458 align:start position:0%
just said if this provision is approved
 
05:45:50.628 --> 05:45:50.638 align:start position:0%
that current rate would continue if this
 
05:45:52.970 --> 05:45:52.980 align:start position:0%
provision is not approved that rate
 
05:45:55.610 --> 05:45:55.620 align:start position:0%
would likely either decrease or we would
 
05:45:58.368 --> 05:45:58.378 align:start position:0%
decrease the number of meals provided
 
05:46:01.730 --> 05:46:01.740 align:start position:0%
thank you but but we'll trade because I
 
05:46:03.230 --> 05:46:03.240 align:start position:0%
heard you say an eight dollar rate and
 
05:46:06.288 --> 05:46:06.298 align:start position:0%
then an 11 rate if we do this we go to
 
05:46:08.030 --> 05:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
the eleven dollar rate if we don't do
 
05:46:09.590 --> 05:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
this we'll probably fall back to the
 
05:46:12.470 --> 05:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
Eight dollar rate I I I I don't know
 
05:46:14.750 --> 05:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
where where the 10 or 11 dollar rate is
 
05:46:17.930 --> 05:46:17.940 align:start position:0%
but but we had a 6.65 meal rate this
 
05:46:21.948 --> 05:46:21.958 align:start position:0%
increased it to 8.11 okay I I think that
 
05:46:25.128 --> 05:46:25.138 align:start position:0%
10 may be associated with an earlier
 
05:46:27.350 --> 05:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
discussion a few weeks ago
 
05:46:29.330 --> 05:46:29.340 align:start position:0%
um for the for for the homeless Services
 
05:46:32.150 --> 05:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
where we were paying like a a per day
 
05:46:33.650 --> 05:46:33.660 align:start position:0%
rate I think that's where the ten dollar
 
05:46:36.530 --> 05:46:36.540 align:start position:0%
figure came from so so the obvious is
 
05:46:38.810 --> 05:46:38.820 align:start position:0%
the food inflation rate means that we
 
05:46:40.548 --> 05:46:40.558 align:start position:0%
probably need to go to the higher rate
 
05:46:43.430 --> 05:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
right but so the only
 
05:46:46.970 --> 05:46:46.980 align:start position:0%
policy thing for us to decide is do we
 
05:46:48.590 --> 05:46:48.600 align:start position:0%
want to go ahead and step up after
 
05:46:50.868 --> 05:46:50.878 align:start position:0%
saying don't get used to the arpa money
 
05:46:53.930 --> 05:46:53.940 align:start position:0%
and replace the arpa money
 
05:46:58.010 --> 05:46:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:01.730 --> 05:47:01.740 align:start position:0%
if we look at those two numbers that's
 
05:47:04.548 --> 05:47:04.558 align:start position:0%
closer to like a thirty percent increase
 
05:47:07.990 --> 05:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
can you do that in your head real quick
 
05:47:10.548 --> 05:47:10.558 align:start position:0%
and inflation doesn't seem like it's a
 
05:47:12.230 --> 05:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
30 increase that's where I was going if
 
05:47:13.368 --> 05:47:13.378 align:start position:0%
we're going to choose a different number
 
05:47:14.628 --> 05:47:14.638 align:start position:0%
I would choose it more in line with
 
05:47:21.590 --> 05:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:23.030 --> 05:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
give them to me I'll do it on my
 
05:47:27.890 --> 05:47:27.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:31.010 --> 05:47:31.020 align:start position:0%
yeah so so that that's uh approximately
 
05:47:34.368 --> 05:47:34.378 align:start position:0%
22 percent increase however
 
05:47:36.650 --> 05:47:36.660 align:start position:0%
um if if you go to the supermarket you
 
05:47:38.030 --> 05:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
know three years ago to what you're
 
05:47:40.310 --> 05:47:40.320 align:start position:0%
paying today it's probably close to in
 
05:47:43.368 --> 05:47:43.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:45.948 --> 05:47:45.958 align:start position:0%
all right so I'm gonna I'm gonna hold
 
05:47:48.470 --> 05:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
this so that people can contemplate over
 
05:47:52.070 --> 05:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
the weekend what I think the real policy
 
05:47:54.230 --> 05:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
implication here is it's not it's not
 
05:47:57.890 --> 05:47:57.900 align:start position:0%
the it isn't just the money it's that we
 
05:48:00.770 --> 05:48:00.780 align:start position:0%
said don't get used to the extra arpa
 
05:48:02.270 --> 05:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
money because we're not going to
 
05:48:03.590 --> 05:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
guarantee you that we're going to
 
05:48:06.350 --> 05:48:06.360 align:start position:0%
replace it and here we are
 
05:48:09.708 --> 05:48:09.718 align:start position:0%
first instance the arpa money's gone and
 
05:48:11.510 --> 05:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
and somebody wants to give them the
 
05:48:13.250 --> 05:48:13.260 align:start position:0%
general funds so go ahead represent
 
05:48:14.570 --> 05:48:14.580 align:start position:0%
Waller I think
 
05:48:15.650 --> 05:48:15.660 align:start position:0%
I think we are promoting to the
 
05:48:17.330 --> 05:48:17.340 align:start position:0%
advantage of the state
 
05:48:21.170 --> 05:48:21.180 align:start position:0%
so that we didn't use General funds
 
05:48:25.548 --> 05:48:25.558 align:start position:0%
did providers needed that rate increase
 
05:48:28.490 --> 05:48:28.500 align:start position:0%
in order to provide those meals they
 
05:48:31.430 --> 05:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
were I mean food prices were going up
 
05:48:34.910 --> 05:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
the state all of us were fortunate that
 
05:48:37.548 --> 05:48:37.558 align:start position:0%
there was a pile of money that came in
 
05:48:39.830 --> 05:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
and we were able to use that for
 
05:48:41.628 --> 05:48:41.638 align:start position:0%
something that we knew we had to do we
 
05:48:44.330 --> 05:48:44.340 align:start position:0%
knew we needed to increase that rate so
 
05:48:46.490 --> 05:48:46.500 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's fair to say to the
 
05:48:48.948 --> 05:48:48.958 align:start position:0%
provider of the meal
 
05:48:51.288 --> 05:48:51.298 align:start position:0%
that you shouldn't get used to it
 
05:48:54.890 --> 05:48:54.900 align:start position:0%
because that we should then we shouldn't
 
05:48:56.810 --> 05:48:56.820 align:start position:0%
get used to the high prices in the
 
05:48:59.510 --> 05:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
grocery store I mean I just I just think
 
05:49:01.910 --> 05:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
it really was to the advantage of the
 
05:49:01.920 --> 05:49:02.750 align:start position:0%
it really was to the advantage of the
state

05:49:02.750 --> 05:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:49:05.810 --> 05:49:05.820 align:start position:0%
almost more than it was to the to the
 
05:49:07.670 --> 05:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
provider the provider needed that rate
 
05:49:10.310 --> 05:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
increase the state found another way of
 
05:49:11.750 --> 05:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
funding it
 
05:49:15.890 --> 05:49:15.900 align:start position:0%
and we were lucky yeah okay so the the
 
05:49:19.330 --> 05:49:19.340 align:start position:0%
money came because uh the the pandemic
 
05:49:23.330 --> 05:49:23.340 align:start position:0%
created an uh an artificial temporary
 
05:49:25.128 --> 05:49:25.138 align:start position:0%
surge in the number of people that
 
05:49:28.250 --> 05:49:28.260 align:start position:0%
needed servicing and so in theory the
 
05:49:30.650 --> 05:49:30.660 align:start position:0%
money that we got from arpa was intended
 
05:49:32.930 --> 05:49:32.940 align:start position:0%
to cover that surge
 
05:49:36.048 --> 05:49:36.058 align:start position:0%
and so the expectation was that that
 
05:49:38.208 --> 05:49:38.218 align:start position:0%
surge wouldn't continue post pandemic
 
05:49:40.610 --> 05:49:40.620 align:start position:0%
and so therefore if the arpa money went
 
05:49:42.708 --> 05:49:42.718 align:start position:0%
away there shouldn't be an expectation
 
05:49:44.570 --> 05:49:44.580 align:start position:0%
that the general fund would step in
 
05:49:48.230 --> 05:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
that's that's what I think we did
 
05:49:51.890 --> 05:49:51.900 align:start position:0%
what we're finding out is that even
 
05:49:54.048 --> 05:49:54.058 align:start position:0%
though the arpa money went away the
 
05:49:55.788 --> 05:49:55.798 align:start position:0%
price increases in the grocery store
 
05:49:57.288 --> 05:49:57.298 align:start position:0%
didn't go away
 
05:50:01.250 --> 05:50:01.260 align:start position:0%
and then there are still people who need
 
05:50:04.208 --> 05:50:04.218 align:start position:0%
a home delivered meal probably more now
 
05:50:06.890 --> 05:50:06.900 align:start position:0%
actually because the prices are so high
 
05:50:08.930 --> 05:50:08.940 align:start position:0%
in the grocery store representative
 
05:50:10.670 --> 05:50:10.680 align:start position:0%
Waller do you have a comment
 
05:50:12.948 --> 05:50:12.958 align:start position:0%
yeah I was on Meals on Wheels board for
 
05:50:14.030 --> 05:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
a few years
 
05:50:15.708 --> 05:50:15.718 align:start position:0%
the um
 
05:50:18.830 --> 05:50:18.840 align:start position:0%
this money is just a small piece of what
 
05:50:19.910 --> 05:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
they spent
 
05:50:22.070 --> 05:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
they get even though the people they
 
05:50:24.410 --> 05:50:24.420 align:start position:0%
deliver the meals to give them very
 
05:50:26.830 --> 05:50:26.840 align:start position:0%
small contributions
 
05:50:29.150 --> 05:50:29.160 align:start position:0%
they do most of their fundraising
 
05:50:32.330 --> 05:50:32.340 align:start position:0%
themselves so this is just our share
 
05:50:34.548 --> 05:50:34.558 align:start position:0%
because many of them think they couldn't
 
05:50:36.230 --> 05:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
make it without our share even though
 
05:50:38.030 --> 05:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
they're out there probably raising the
 
05:50:40.310 --> 05:50:40.320 align:start position:0%
majority of the funds themselves this
 
05:50:42.650 --> 05:50:42.660 align:start position:0%
little bit keeps them going and don't
 
05:50:44.448 --> 05:50:44.458 align:start position:0%
forget there's I don't know if there's
 
05:50:45.708 --> 05:50:45.718 align:start position:0%
as many as it does in different
 
05:50:47.690 --> 05:50:47.700 align:start position:0%
organizations but there's at least one
 
05:50:49.010 --> 05:50:49.020 align:start position:0%
for every County
 
05:50:49.020 --> 05:50:50.150 align:start position:0%
for every County
so

05:50:50.150 --> 05:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:50:52.910 --> 05:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
this is multi-organizations
 
05:50:55.910 --> 05:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
so I hear you're in favor of keeping hb2
 
05:50:58.310 --> 05:50:58.320 align:start position:0%
as written I am
 
05:51:00.470 --> 05:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
05:51:00.480 --> 05:51:01.490 align:start position:0%
okay so
um

05:51:01.490 --> 05:51:01.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:51:04.190 --> 05:51:04.200 align:start position:0%
well we're still we can still wait till
 
05:51:05.990 --> 05:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
Monday but that just gives us something
 
05:51:09.948 --> 05:51:09.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:11.208 --> 05:51:11.218 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm just ask a quick question about
 
05:51:13.430 --> 05:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
that yeah unrelated to supporting or not
 
05:51:16.430 --> 05:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
supporting it so I I have accounts 7872
 
05:51:18.650 --> 05:51:18.660 align:start position:0%
and 9255
 
05:51:20.628 --> 05:51:20.638 align:start position:0%
um fund um meals and wheels are there
 
05:51:22.310 --> 05:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
other accounts that you don't have to
 
05:51:23.750 --> 05:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
look this up right now but if there are
 
05:51:25.850 --> 05:51:25.860 align:start position:0%
the cons could you just let us know
 
05:51:28.310 --> 05:51:28.320 align:start position:0%
sure are those from the email that I'd
 
05:51:30.350 --> 05:51:30.360 align:start position:0%
sent earlier in the week everything's
 
05:51:33.410 --> 05:51:33.420 align:start position:0%
from the email you sent yep
 
05:51:36.110 --> 05:51:36.120 align:start position:0%
so if representative hole this year
 
05:51:39.350 --> 05:51:39.360 align:start position:0%
I we can take a straw vote on that I I
 
05:51:42.010 --> 05:51:42.020 align:start position:0%
would be in favor of
 
05:51:46.310 --> 05:51:46.320 align:start position:0%
maintaining 255 as written
 
05:51:49.250 --> 05:51:49.260 align:start position:0%
is there any opposition to them
 
05:51:49.260 --> 05:51:50.390 align:start position:0%
is there any opposition to them
okay

05:51:50.390 --> 05:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:51:50.400 --> 05:51:51.948 align:start position:0%
okay
so

05:51:51.948 --> 05:51:51.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:51:54.650 --> 05:51:54.660 align:start position:0%
um if you're in favor of re leaving 255
 
05:51:58.010 --> 05:51:58.020 align:start position:0%
as wrote and raise your hand
 
05:52:02.830 --> 05:52:02.840 align:start position:0%
as opposed no one so we'll move on
 
05:52:06.770 --> 05:52:06.780 align:start position:0%
uh 256.
 
05:52:08.510 --> 05:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
appropriates General funds and the
 
05:52:14.208 --> 05:52:14.218 align:start position:0%
amount of 870 000 and then 957 thousand
 
05:52:16.548 --> 05:52:16.558 align:start position:0%
to increase foster care rates to be
 
05:52:19.010 --> 05:52:19.020 align:start position:0%
consistent with the cost of raising a
 
05:52:19.020 --> 05:52:20.208 align:start position:0%
consistent with the cost of raising a
child

05:52:20.208 --> 05:52:20.218 align:start position:0%
child
 
05:52:20.218 --> 05:52:22.970 align:start position:0%
child
now

05:52:22.970 --> 05:52:22.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:25.910 --> 05:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
is this one of those line items Mr White
 
05:52:28.390 --> 05:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
that that three percent
 
05:52:31.490 --> 05:52:31.500 align:start position:0%
efficiency budget caused us to become a
 
05:52:33.770 --> 05:52:33.780 align:start position:0%
priority need
 
05:52:36.890 --> 05:52:36.900 align:start position:0%
or or why why is this an hb2 item and
 
05:52:38.810 --> 05:52:38.820 align:start position:0%
just not a budget request I guess is the
 
05:52:40.610 --> 05:52:40.620 align:start position:0%
other way to say that this was a new
 
05:52:44.930 --> 05:52:44.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:50.030 --> 05:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:50.040 --> 05:52:51.170 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:52:51.170 --> 05:52:51.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:52:53.390 --> 05:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
we we really need to do what we can to
 
05:52:55.850 --> 05:52:55.860 align:start position:0%
have a strong foster care program and
 
05:52:58.548 --> 05:52:58.558 align:start position:0%
I'm in favor of these rates I I'm I'm
 
05:53:02.750 --> 05:53:02.760 align:start position:0%
okay with HP too uh item 256. is there
 
05:53:05.150 --> 05:53:05.160 align:start position:0%
any opposition well this is a relatively
 
05:53:07.190 --> 05:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
small amount of money I think if I read
 
05:53:08.750 --> 05:53:08.760 align:start position:0%
read our uh
 
05:53:10.730 --> 05:53:10.740 align:start position:0%
our briefing books correctly it's only
 
05:53:13.430 --> 05:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
it's another two percent on top of that
 
05:53:15.110 --> 05:53:15.120 align:start position:0%
um do you know if there was already some
 
05:53:17.448 --> 05:53:17.458 align:start position:0%
increases built into the original budget
 
05:53:20.288 --> 05:53:20.298 align:start position:0%
and this is on top of that
 
05:53:24.590 --> 05:53:24.600 align:start position:0%
no so so the this this request is made
 
05:53:27.590 --> 05:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
so so back in roughly 2019 the count of
 
05:53:29.270 --> 05:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
Youth in placement was
 
05:53:32.270 --> 05:53:32.280 align:start position:0%
about 1200 at a high and it sends one to
 
05:53:36.350 --> 05:53:36.360 align:start position:0%
about 975 but it's creeped up back above
 
05:53:39.770 --> 05:53:39.780 align:start position:0%
a thousand in in recent times but what
 
05:53:42.048 --> 05:53:42.058 align:start position:0%
this would provide us this would provide
 
05:53:43.910 --> 05:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
us with
 
05:53:46.430 --> 05:53:46.440 align:start position:0%
this would increase the rates uh
 
05:53:49.070 --> 05:53:49.080 align:start position:0%
generally by about 10 percent in the
 
05:53:52.850 --> 05:53:52.860 align:start position:0%
first year and 25 percent by the second
 
05:53:56.030 --> 05:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
year to move to move the amounts from
 
05:53:58.990 --> 05:53:59.000 align:start position:0%
the low median income to the to the
 
05:54:03.170 --> 05:54:03.180 align:start position:0%
middle income to try to better align the
 
05:54:05.690 --> 05:54:05.700 align:start position:0%
rates with the families that that are
 
05:54:07.430 --> 05:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
providing services
 
05:54:13.850 --> 05:54:13.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:16.310 --> 05:54:16.320 align:start position:0%
any other comments representative Holt
 
05:54:19.010 --> 05:54:19.020 align:start position:0%
thank you so roughly a thousand children
 
05:54:20.690 --> 05:54:20.700 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about in the foster
 
05:54:24.830 --> 05:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
care system and this is above and beyond
 
05:54:27.470 --> 05:54:27.480 align:start position:0%
some other appropriation HP one
 
05:54:29.510 --> 05:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
or is this the total appropriation I'm
 
05:54:32.030 --> 05:54:32.040 align:start position:0%
not this is in addition to it these
 
05:54:33.708 --> 05:54:33.718 align:start position:0%
additional dollars would give us the
 
05:54:36.530 --> 05:54:36.540 align:start position:0%
ability to to increase those rates to
 
05:54:37.730 --> 05:54:37.740 align:start position:0%
try to encourage additional
 
05:54:39.830 --> 05:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
participation do you know what the other
 
05:54:41.930 --> 05:54:41.940 align:start position:0%
amounts are or is that easy is that easy
 
05:54:44.868 --> 05:54:44.878 align:start position:0%
to find or point me to a line item in
 
05:54:44.878 --> 05:54:46.490 align:start position:0%
to find or point me to a line item in
hb1

05:54:46.490 --> 05:54:46.500 align:start position:0%
hb1
 
05:54:49.010 --> 05:54:49.020 align:start position:0%
um I I can certainly I I can dig that up
 
05:54:52.070 --> 05:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:52.080 --> 05:54:53.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:54:53.990 --> 05:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:54:56.448 --> 05:54:56.458 align:start position:0%
so do you need that information before
 
05:54:59.090 --> 05:54:59.100 align:start position:0%
feeling comfortable voting on this all
 
05:55:01.490 --> 05:55:01.500 align:start position:0%
right so I would like to do a straw vote
 
05:55:06.368 --> 05:55:06.378 align:start position:0%
on 256 on maintaining this foster care
 
05:55:09.590 --> 05:55:09.600 align:start position:0%
item as is raise your hand if you're in
 
05:55:09.600 --> 05:55:13.150 align:start position:0%
item as is raise your hand if you're in
favor

05:55:13.150 --> 05:55:13.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:17.090 --> 05:55:17.100 align:start position:0%
uh it's all right uh who anyone opposed
 
05:55:19.430 --> 05:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
I don't think you raised your hand what
 
05:55:23.208 --> 05:55:23.218 align:start position:0%
you're going to wait okay so that's like
 
05:55:29.510 --> 05:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
seven to uh zero with two abstentions
 
05:55:32.150 --> 05:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
um all right
 
05:55:32.160 --> 05:55:34.490 align:start position:0%
um all right
257

05:55:34.490 --> 05:55:34.500 align:start position:0%
257
 
05:55:36.890 --> 05:55:36.900 align:start position:0%
this is the 17 million dollars for the
 
05:55:38.810 --> 05:55:38.820 align:start position:0%
3.1 percent
 
05:55:38.820 --> 05:55:40.430 align:start position:0%
3.1 percent
I

05:55:40.430 --> 05:55:40.440 align:start position:0%
I
 
05:55:42.770 --> 05:55:42.780 align:start position:0%
okay so so
 
05:55:45.110 --> 05:55:45.120 align:start position:0%
you tell me how we should do this if we
 
05:55:48.948 --> 05:55:48.958 align:start position:0%
actually end up targeting rates should
 
05:55:51.770 --> 05:55:51.780 align:start position:0%
we take our efforts to Target it and
 
05:55:51.780 --> 05:55:53.390 align:start position:0%
we take our efforts to Target it and
amend

05:55:53.390 --> 05:55:53.400 align:start position:0%
amend
 
05:55:57.948 --> 05:55:57.958 align:start position:0%
it em 257 so that there's just one
 
05:56:00.708 --> 05:56:00.718 align:start position:0%
comprehensive item or should we do the
 
05:56:03.350 --> 05:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
supplemental separate I think if you
 
05:56:05.150 --> 05:56:05.160 align:start position:0%
want to keep the 17 million per year
 
05:56:07.010 --> 05:56:07.020 align:start position:0%
that's in there for 3.1 percent across
 
05:56:09.048 --> 05:56:09.058 align:start position:0%
the board you could leave that alone and
 
05:56:10.910 --> 05:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
then add a new section appropriating
 
05:56:12.410 --> 05:56:12.420 align:start position:0%
funds for targeted rates and then
 
05:56:14.990 --> 05:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
identify the provider types to which you
 
05:56:17.208 --> 05:56:17.218 align:start position:0%
wanted to Target them but because the
 
05:56:19.128 --> 05:56:19.138 align:start position:0%
hospital Association says they don't
 
05:56:21.410 --> 05:56:21.420 align:start position:0%
need to participate in the 3.1 percent
 
05:56:24.708 --> 05:56:24.718 align:start position:0%
it may be better just to amend this to
 
05:56:27.650 --> 05:56:27.660 align:start position:0%
say more precisely what we intend to do
 
05:56:30.470 --> 05:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
with the larger number
 
05:56:32.990 --> 05:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
and you if the intent is to not provide
 
05:56:34.548 --> 05:56:34.558 align:start position:0%
rate increases to hospitals I think you
 
05:56:36.410 --> 05:56:36.420 align:start position:0%
need to amend this section anyway to
 
05:56:38.690 --> 05:56:38.700 align:start position:0%
specify that and also to reduce the 17
 
05:56:42.610 --> 05:56:42.620 align:start position:0%
million dollar figure yeah so so
 
05:56:45.708 --> 05:56:45.718 align:start position:0%
Mr Anan since you're here
 
05:56:48.288 --> 05:56:48.298 align:start position:0%
what we have assumed looking at all the
 
05:56:50.330 --> 05:56:50.340 align:start position:0%
material and hearing you listening to
 
05:56:53.150 --> 05:56:53.160 align:start position:0%
you is that even though we're putting
 
05:56:56.448 --> 05:56:56.458 align:start position:0%
3.1 percent across the board you're
 
05:56:59.030 --> 05:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
saying the hospital Association would
 
05:57:02.330 --> 05:57:02.340 align:start position:0%
rather have your share of that 3.1
 
05:57:05.090 --> 05:57:05.100 align:start position:0%
percent allocated to other care
 
05:57:07.970 --> 05:57:07.980 align:start position:0%
providers rather than coming to the
 
05:57:09.650 --> 05:57:09.660 align:start position:0%
hospitals is that is that a fair
 
05:57:13.150 --> 05:57:13.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:13.160 --> 05:57:14.690 align:start position:0%
 
unbelievable

05:57:14.690 --> 05:57:14.700 align:start position:0%
unbelievable
 
05:57:17.448 --> 05:57:17.458 align:start position:0%
all right you're the first one I've ever
 
05:57:17.458 --> 05:57:19.368 align:start position:0%
all right you're the first one I've ever
met

05:57:19.368 --> 05:57:19.378 align:start position:0%
met
 
05:57:22.850 --> 05:57:22.860 align:start position:0%
so good it's a pleasure and an honor
 
05:57:22.860 --> 05:57:24.110 align:start position:0%
so good it's a pleasure and an honor
um

05:57:24.110 --> 05:57:24.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:57:27.650 --> 05:57:27.660 align:start position:0%
so so I think we have to amend 257 right
 
05:57:33.948 --> 05:57:33.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:33.958 --> 05:57:34.628 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:57:34.628 --> 05:57:34.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:57:34.638 --> 05:57:36.170 align:start position:0%
um
to

05:57:36.170 --> 05:57:36.180 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:57:39.970 --> 05:57:39.980 align:start position:0%
wait I have 276 here on the list I have
 
05:57:44.390 --> 05:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
282. what did did we get rid of 276 on
 
05:57:47.030 --> 05:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
another effort
 
05:57:49.730 --> 05:57:49.740 align:start position:0%
just let me see transfers federally
 
05:57:51.650 --> 05:57:51.660 align:start position:0%
funded positions from the office of
 
05:57:53.570 --> 05:57:53.580 align:start position:0%
chief medical examiner to the division
 
05:57:58.128 --> 05:57:58.138 align:start position:0%
of public we got rid of that oh
 
05:58:00.230 --> 05:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
yes that's the department of justice
 
05:58:02.390 --> 05:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
issue in division one already addressed
 
05:58:05.330 --> 05:58:05.340 align:start position:0%
that all right so now we're on two eight
 
05:58:05.340 --> 05:58:06.530 align:start position:0%
that all right so now we're on two eight
two

05:58:06.530 --> 05:58:06.540 align:start position:0%
two
 
05:58:08.868 --> 05:58:08.878 align:start position:0%
statutory requirements for hospitals
 
05:58:10.850 --> 05:58:10.860 align:start position:0%
applying for designation as receiving
 
05:58:10.860 --> 05:58:13.070 align:start position:0%
applying for designation as receiving
facilities

05:58:13.070 --> 05:58:13.080 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
05:58:13.080 --> 05:58:14.628 align:start position:0%
facilities
um

05:58:14.628 --> 05:58:14.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:58:19.730 --> 05:58:19.740 align:start position:0%
and then 283 is similar it's a directing
 
05:58:19.740 --> 05:58:20.690 align:start position:0%
and then 283 is similar it's a directing
um

05:58:20.690 --> 05:58:20.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:58:24.590 --> 05:58:24.600 align:start position:0%
I I'm I'm predisposed to wanting to
 
05:58:29.090 --> 05:58:29.100 align:start position:0%
remove 282 and 283 because I think it's
 
05:58:32.090 --> 05:58:32.100 align:start position:0%
an inappropriate uh unplanned
 
05:58:34.730 --> 05:58:34.740 align:start position:0%
intervention of the government and to
 
05:58:37.310 --> 05:58:37.320 align:start position:0%
the Health Care delivery system at a
 
05:58:39.470 --> 05:58:39.480 align:start position:0%
detail level in which we have no
 
05:58:41.208 --> 05:58:41.218 align:start position:0%
business interacting
 
05:58:44.930 --> 05:58:44.940 align:start position:0%
so I would not do these two things are
 
05:58:52.970 --> 05:58:52.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:55.670 --> 05:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
some of our hospitals have all those
 
05:58:57.770 --> 05:58:57.780 align:start position:0%
programs that they can
 
05:59:00.288 --> 05:59:00.298 align:start position:0%
rely on in the first place so it would
 
05:59:03.948 --> 05:59:03.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:07.190 --> 05:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
are there other comments representative
 
05:59:07.200 --> 05:59:09.048 align:start position:0%
are there other comments representative
Weiler

05:59:09.048 --> 05:59:09.058 align:start position:0%
Weiler
 
05:59:11.448 --> 05:59:11.458 align:start position:0%
that we'd be this is important to the
 
05:59:13.190 --> 05:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
governor I'm just wondering what do you
 
05:59:16.250 --> 05:59:16.260 align:start position:0%
think about are removing these two items
 
05:59:18.288 --> 05:59:18.298 align:start position:0%
well it's it's part of trying to get
 
05:59:22.090 --> 05:59:22.100 align:start position:0%
them out of the emergency rooms I think
 
05:59:24.708 --> 05:59:24.718 align:start position:0%
that's that's the that's the stated
 
05:59:28.310 --> 05:59:28.320 align:start position:0%
intent and as we know oftentimes the
 
05:59:30.410 --> 05:59:30.420 align:start position:0%
actual effect of something isn't what is
 
05:59:30.420 --> 05:59:32.448 align:start position:0%
actual effect of something isn't what is
intended

05:59:32.448 --> 05:59:32.458 align:start position:0%
intended
 
05:59:34.730 --> 05:59:34.740 align:start position:0%
if if we don't pass it does it make it
 
05:59:36.048 --> 05:59:36.058 align:start position:0%
harder for them to get it out of the
 
05:59:39.170 --> 05:59:39.180 align:start position:0%
emergency rooms or it they have to be a
 
05:59:42.230 --> 05:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
designated receiving facility while
 
05:59:44.270 --> 05:59:44.280 align:start position:0%
while you were out what one of the
 
05:59:46.788 --> 05:59:46.798 align:start position:0%
conversations we had was what we wanted
 
05:59:50.810 --> 05:59:50.820 align:start position:0%
to do with the additional money that we
 
05:59:53.628 --> 05:59:53.638 align:start position:0%
thought we would allocate to above the
 
05:59:56.390 --> 05:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
3.1 percent Medicaid rate on a targeted
 
05:59:56.400 --> 05:59:57.430 align:start position:0%
3.1 percent Medicaid rate on a targeted
basis

05:59:57.430 --> 05:59:57.440 align:start position:0%
basis
 
06:00:01.610 --> 06:00:01.620 align:start position:0%
and I I talked through our first
 
06:00:03.708 --> 06:00:03.718 align:start position:0%
priority and no one just told me I was
 
06:00:06.730 --> 06:00:06.740 align:start position:0%
wrong but I talked through as a priority
 
06:00:11.628 --> 06:00:11.638 align:start position:0%
to give the hospitals capacity uh in the
 
06:00:14.208 --> 06:00:14.218 align:start position:0%
community to discharge patients into to
 
06:00:17.690 --> 06:00:17.700 align:start position:0%
Target Medicaid to help create capacity
 
06:00:19.970 --> 06:00:19.980 align:start position:0%
outside the hospital so they can be
 
06:00:23.990 --> 06:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
discharged and to and then we would also
 
06:00:25.208 --> 06:00:25.218 align:start position:0%
talk about
 
06:00:28.070 --> 06:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
prioritizing community-based solutions
 
06:00:30.948 --> 06:00:30.958 align:start position:0%
to intervene in that patient's care
 
06:00:33.830 --> 06:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
before they end up in the ER so if we
 
06:00:37.250 --> 06:00:37.260 align:start position:0%
can reduce the input of patients and we
 
06:00:40.850 --> 06:00:40.860 align:start position:0%
can improve the output of patients we
 
06:00:43.490 --> 06:00:43.500 align:start position:0%
should be directly addressing the
 
06:00:46.190 --> 06:00:46.200 align:start position:0%
emergency room boarding problem that
 
06:00:49.250 --> 06:00:49.260 align:start position:0%
that would be a major priority so so
 
06:00:51.048 --> 06:00:51.058 align:start position:0%
it's that's a long answer to your
 
06:00:53.470 --> 06:00:53.480 align:start position:0%
question that we would attempt to
 
06:00:57.830 --> 06:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
achieve this intent but in a more I
 
06:01:01.090 --> 06:01:01.100 align:start position:0%
guess market-based approach than a
 
06:01:03.890 --> 06:01:03.900 align:start position:0%
command economy-directed way
 
06:01:06.110 --> 06:01:06.120 align:start position:0%
I guess the problems we ran into in the
 
06:01:08.030 --> 06:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
past with designated receiving
 
06:01:10.788 --> 06:01:10.798 align:start position:0%
facilities is they would keep those beds
 
06:01:12.708 --> 06:01:12.718 align:start position:0%
empty but still expect us to pay for
 
06:01:15.048 --> 06:01:15.058 align:start position:0%
them on a daily daily basis
 
06:01:17.330 --> 06:01:17.340 align:start position:0%
so they would be available and they had
 
06:01:18.650 --> 06:01:18.660 align:start position:0%
the staff and they had everything else
 
06:01:20.690 --> 06:01:20.700 align:start position:0%
they said you need to pay for these
 
06:01:22.368 --> 06:01:22.378 align:start position:0%
every day whether we use them or not
 
06:01:24.770 --> 06:01:24.780 align:start position:0%
because we're keeping them empty except
 
06:01:26.330 --> 06:01:26.340 align:start position:0%
for this special
 
06:01:29.750 --> 06:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
things and and uh so I don't know if
 
06:01:32.448 --> 06:01:32.458 align:start position:0%
that's still an effect or or this is
 
06:01:34.970 --> 06:01:34.980 align:start position:0%
trying to make it easier to designate
 
06:01:37.850 --> 06:01:37.860 align:start position:0%
receiving facilities
 
06:01:40.310 --> 06:01:40.320 align:start position:0%
I don't know we could ask stating the
 
06:01:43.610 --> 06:01:43.620 align:start position:0%
what the what the what it says go go
 
06:01:45.890 --> 06:01:45.900 align:start position:0%
ahead I I I'm interrupting
 
06:01:47.570 --> 06:01:47.580 align:start position:0%
representative nordgren who had her hand
 
06:01:49.490 --> 06:01:49.500 align:start position:0%
up but if you're following up on on
 
06:01:52.010 --> 06:01:52.020 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler go ahead no go
 
06:01:54.350 --> 06:01:54.360 align:start position:0%
ahead go ahead
 
06:01:56.868 --> 06:01:56.878 align:start position:0%
um I I guess I would just say for one
 
06:01:59.090 --> 06:01:59.100 align:start position:0%
thing we would be micromanaging the
 
06:02:01.930 --> 06:02:01.940 align:start position:0%
system I mean we've heard already
 
06:02:06.230 --> 06:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
numerous days of the issues with nursing
 
06:02:08.570 --> 06:02:08.580 align:start position:0%
home Staffing and whatever part of the
 
06:02:12.948 --> 06:02:12.958 align:start position:0%
issue is they don't have places for them
 
06:02:15.470 --> 06:02:15.480 align:start position:0%
to send these people that's not because
 
06:02:18.170 --> 06:02:18.180 align:start position:0%
they want to keep them and fill up their
 
06:02:20.868 --> 06:02:20.878 align:start position:0%
ER beds they just have
 
06:02:24.530 --> 06:02:24.540 align:start position:0%
issues with discharge availability
 
06:02:28.070 --> 06:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
okay that's not what the 282 says
 
06:02:32.628 --> 06:02:32.638 align:start position:0%
what it says is any facility May apply
 
06:02:35.990 --> 06:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
no designation shall occur without the
 
06:02:38.090 --> 06:02:38.100 align:start position:0%
express written consent of the
 
06:02:39.770 --> 06:02:39.780 align:start position:0%
administrator of the facility to be
 
06:02:41.750 --> 06:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
designated so that's not forcing anybody
 
06:02:43.670 --> 06:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
to do anything in 282.
 
06:02:45.048 --> 06:02:45.058 align:start position:0%
now I haven't gotten to reading the
 
06:02:47.628 --> 06:02:47.638 align:start position:0%
whole of 283 yet but you seem to be
 
06:02:49.970 --> 06:02:49.980 align:start position:0%
misstating what the intent of at least
 
06:02:51.590 --> 06:02:51.600 align:start position:0%
that one is
 
06:02:53.750 --> 06:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
that's possible
 
06:02:57.110 --> 06:02:57.120 align:start position:0%
um 283 requires it well let me read that
 
06:02:58.930 --> 06:02:58.940 align:start position:0%
one Mr
 
06:03:01.250 --> 06:03:01.260 align:start position:0%
are you open to
 
06:03:01.260 --> 06:03:04.730 align:start position:0%
are you open to
comment

06:03:04.730 --> 06:03:04.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:07.970 --> 06:03:07.980 align:start position:0%
would you would you maybe obviously have
 
06:03:09.590 --> 06:03:09.600 align:start position:0%
to introduce yourself but would you
 
06:03:13.128 --> 06:03:13.138 align:start position:0%
would you then start by telling us the
 
06:03:15.288 --> 06:03:15.298 align:start position:0%
hospital association's interpretation of
 
06:03:22.548 --> 06:03:22.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:24.650 --> 06:03:24.660 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry Stephen and president of the
 
06:03:27.190 --> 06:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
hospital Association it is our view that
 
06:03:31.788 --> 06:03:31.798 align:start position:0%
282 and 283 would compel any hospital as
 
06:03:34.788 --> 06:03:34.798 align:start position:0%
a condition of their license to have a
 
06:03:36.530 --> 06:03:36.540 align:start position:0%
certain number of designated receiving
 
06:03:39.288 --> 06:03:39.298 align:start position:0%
facility beds
 
06:03:42.650 --> 06:03:42.660 align:start position:0%
so let's just stay on 282. yeah can you
 
06:03:44.150 --> 06:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
tell me where the words are that that
 
06:03:46.690 --> 06:03:46.700 align:start position:0%
say it makes a condition of your life
 
06:03:51.948 --> 06:03:51.958 align:start position:0%
politely said again it requires them to
 
06:03:54.288 --> 06:03:54.298 align:start position:0%
have a certain number of designated
 
06:03:56.150 --> 06:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
receiving facility beds as a condition
 
06:03:58.250 --> 06:03:58.260 align:start position:0%
of their license so if you're going to
 
06:04:00.048 --> 06:04:00.058 align:start position:0%
have a license as a hospital you would
 
06:04:01.970 --> 06:04:01.980 align:start position:0%
be required to have
 
06:04:04.670 --> 06:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
um a number of drf beds if you have 25
 
06:04:06.770 --> 06:04:06.780 align:start position:0%
beds or less you'd have two if you had
 
06:04:09.590 --> 06:04:09.600 align:start position:0%
26 to 100 yeah you'd have four
 
06:04:12.230 --> 06:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
um and so on and so forth um
 
06:04:15.470 --> 06:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
282 basically takes the hospital out as
 
06:04:19.390 --> 06:04:19.400 align:start position:0%
an option for the May and then 283
 
06:04:22.610 --> 06:04:22.620 align:start position:0%
requires the hospitals that they show to
 
06:04:23.990 --> 06:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
receive licensing if I believe it
 
06:04:24.000 --> 06:04:25.310 align:start position:0%
receive licensing if I believe it
correct

06:04:25.310 --> 06:04:25.320 align:start position:0%
correct
 
06:04:27.410 --> 06:04:27.420 align:start position:0%
that's what it means
 
06:04:30.288 --> 06:04:30.298 align:start position:0%
282 already exists and they're just
 
06:04:33.048 --> 06:04:33.058 align:start position:0%
removing hospitals that's correct that's
 
06:04:34.850 --> 06:04:34.860 align:start position:0%
correct that's correct from the May I'm
 
06:04:38.750 --> 06:04:38.760 align:start position:0%
sorry so 282 simply says these entities
 
06:04:40.430 --> 06:04:40.440 align:start position:0%
can apply
 
06:04:42.350 --> 06:04:42.360 align:start position:0%
to have a designated receiving facility
 
06:04:44.510 --> 06:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
bed and it takes the word Hospital out
 
06:04:46.548 --> 06:04:46.558 align:start position:0%
of that so a hospital could not apply
 
06:04:49.670 --> 06:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
and in 283 you would be required
 
06:04:51.128 --> 06:04:51.138 align:start position:0%
thank you so
 
06:04:54.230 --> 06:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
what I think I just heard you say is 282
 
06:04:57.048 --> 06:04:57.058 align:start position:0%
is enabling legislation and it's closer
 
06:04:58.788 --> 06:04:58.798 align:start position:0%
to what representative verf is saying
 
06:05:00.948 --> 06:05:00.958 align:start position:0%
it's not a requirement 282 is not a
 
06:05:03.048 --> 06:05:03.058 align:start position:0%
requirement it's just sort of opening
 
06:05:05.750 --> 06:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
the door to applying to for a
 
06:05:05.760 --> 06:05:07.070 align:start position:0%
the door to applying to for a
designation

06:05:07.070 --> 06:05:07.080 align:start position:0%
designation
 
06:05:10.150 --> 06:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
it it's 283 that's the offensive part
 
06:05:12.890 --> 06:05:12.900 align:start position:0%
282 by itself
 
06:05:15.708 --> 06:05:15.718 align:start position:0%
is is not it doesn't sound
 
06:05:18.048 --> 06:05:18.058 align:start position:0%
I would say there are hospitals that
 
06:05:20.030 --> 06:05:20.040 align:start position:0%
have established designated receiving
 
06:05:22.310 --> 06:05:22.320 align:start position:0%
facility beds and they've chosen to do
 
06:05:22.320 --> 06:05:23.208 align:start position:0%
facility beds and they've chosen to do
that

06:05:23.208 --> 06:05:23.218 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:05:23.218 --> 06:05:23.868 align:start position:0%
that
um

06:05:23.868 --> 06:05:23.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:05:26.330 --> 06:05:26.340 align:start position:0%
this would remove that capacity for them
 
06:05:28.330 --> 06:05:28.340 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
06:05:30.708 --> 06:05:30.718 align:start position:0%
representative it sounds like you've
 
06:05:34.190 --> 06:05:34.200 align:start position:0%
done some homework here well I I don't
 
06:05:36.350 --> 06:05:36.360 align:start position:0%
know if I've done homework but I read
 
06:05:38.448 --> 06:05:38.458 align:start position:0%
through it pretty clearly because I was
 
06:05:40.670 --> 06:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
confused and
 
06:05:40.680 --> 06:05:43.208 align:start position:0%
confused and
um

06:05:43.208 --> 06:05:43.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:46.868 --> 06:05:46.878 align:start position:0%
282 allows all of those
 
06:05:48.830 --> 06:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
entities community mental health
 
06:05:51.048 --> 06:05:51.058 align:start position:0%
programs Community residents nursing
 
06:05:52.788 --> 06:05:52.798 align:start position:0%
homes and other treatment facilities
 
06:05:55.610 --> 06:05:55.620 align:start position:0%
that they may apply to do that but
 
06:05:58.310 --> 06:05:58.320 align:start position:0%
hospitals are removed from that so
 
06:06:00.048 --> 06:06:00.058 align:start position:0%
they're no longer
 
06:06:02.510 --> 06:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
given the choice to apply to be a
 
06:06:04.548 --> 06:06:04.558 align:start position:0%
designated receiving facility and then
 
06:06:07.190 --> 06:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
the new section 283
 
06:06:10.490 --> 06:06:10.500 align:start position:0%
so 282 is existing and not new
 
06:06:15.110 --> 06:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
283 is new and it says hospitals must
 
06:06:16.850 --> 06:06:16.860 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna that's not actually in there
 
06:06:19.670 --> 06:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
but hospitals to meet the licensing
 
06:06:23.810 --> 06:06:23.820 align:start position:0%
requirements must have those beds
 
06:06:27.170 --> 06:06:27.180 align:start position:0%
available so it's requiring that the
 
06:06:29.090 --> 06:06:29.100 align:start position:0%
hospitals participate
 
06:06:31.190 --> 06:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
okay that makes sense to me can you just
 
06:06:33.530 --> 06:06:33.540 align:start position:0%
tell me I don't have RSA 30 135 in front
 
06:06:35.448 --> 06:06:35.458 align:start position:0%
of me where was the word hospitals in
 
06:06:38.090 --> 06:06:38.100 align:start position:0%
that pre in that RSA previously
 
06:06:42.770 --> 06:06:42.780 align:start position:0%
in hb2 it's X Out section 282 line 12 of
 
06:06:44.930 --> 06:06:44.940 align:start position:0%
page 89. so I just have a question for
 
06:06:47.270 --> 06:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
the hospital man then yeah
 
06:06:49.850 --> 06:06:49.860 align:start position:0%
let's say 283 wasn't there
 
06:06:52.010 --> 06:06:52.020 align:start position:0%
how would that harm you
 
06:06:55.490 --> 06:06:55.500 align:start position:0%
if 283 was not there yeah but 282 was it
 
06:06:57.830 --> 06:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
would it would presumably remove the
 
06:07:01.128 --> 06:07:01.138 align:start position:0%
ability of a hospital to open a
 
06:07:03.350 --> 06:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
designated receiving facility if it if
 
06:07:05.510 --> 06:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
it so chose oh okay you couldn't do it
 
06:07:07.368 --> 06:07:07.378 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
06:07:09.770 --> 06:07:09.780 align:start position:0%
fair enough so if we wanted to eliminate
 
06:07:12.590 --> 06:07:12.600 align:start position:0%
if for some reason we wanted to
 
06:07:16.670 --> 06:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
eliminate 283 and keep 282 282 would
 
06:07:18.230 --> 06:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
still have to be amended to add
 
06:07:20.390 --> 06:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
hospitals back in
 
06:07:22.970 --> 06:07:22.980 align:start position:0%
but why would we do that if it's already
 
06:07:25.548 --> 06:07:25.558 align:start position:0%
in the law so the better approach is
 
06:07:28.070 --> 06:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
just to kill them both
 
06:07:28.080 --> 06:07:29.510 align:start position:0%
just to kill them both
if

06:07:29.510 --> 06:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
if
 
06:07:31.490 --> 06:07:31.500 align:start position:0%
if someone is in an emergency room
 
06:07:34.430 --> 06:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
waiting for a hospital bed
 
06:07:37.128 --> 06:07:37.138 align:start position:0%
and this says You must have designated
 
06:07:39.170 --> 06:07:39.180 align:start position:0%
receiving beds
 
06:07:41.030 --> 06:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
is that just mean you can take them out
 
06:07:42.590 --> 06:07:42.600 align:start position:0%
of the emergency room and put them in a
 
06:07:44.868 --> 06:07:44.878 align:start position:0%
designated receiving bed can you do that
 
06:07:44.878 --> 06:07:47.030 align:start position:0%
designated receiving bed can you do that
now

06:07:47.030 --> 06:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
now
 
06:07:50.570 --> 06:07:50.580 align:start position:0%
we if if if there aren't enough today if
 
06:07:52.128 --> 06:07:52.138 align:start position:0%
there aren't enough designated receiving
 
06:07:54.110 --> 06:07:54.120 align:start position:0%
facility beds available that's either
 
06:07:55.730 --> 06:07:55.740 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital or any of the
 
06:07:57.410 --> 06:07:57.420 align:start position:0%
other private hospitals that have those
 
06:07:59.628 --> 06:07:59.638 align:start position:0%
if there isn't a bed available they're
 
06:08:02.628 --> 06:08:02.638 align:start position:0%
unable to transfer them to them this
 
06:08:05.208 --> 06:08:05.218 align:start position:0%
would compel them to have bids I think
 
06:08:07.670 --> 06:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
the challenge as we've shared is how
 
06:08:09.410 --> 06:08:09.420 align:start position:0%
would we staff all of those
 
06:08:12.350 --> 06:08:12.360 align:start position:0%
decentralized um you know beds across
 
06:08:14.090 --> 06:08:14.100 align:start position:0%
the state where where would we find the
 
06:08:15.948 --> 06:08:15.958 align:start position:0%
health care Workforce to serve those
 
06:08:19.490 --> 06:08:19.500 align:start position:0%
patients That's My worry is that some of
 
06:08:20.868 --> 06:08:20.878 align:start position:0%
those people that would be doing that
 
06:08:22.368 --> 06:08:22.378 align:start position:0%
would be coming from New Hampshire
 
06:08:23.690 --> 06:08:23.700 align:start position:0%
hospital the Community Mental Health
 
06:08:24.948 --> 06:08:24.958 align:start position:0%
Centers and others that would only
 
06:08:29.270 --> 06:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
exacerbate the problem we have today so
 
06:08:31.730 --> 06:08:31.740 align:start position:0%
if you already have people in the
 
06:08:34.128 --> 06:08:34.138 align:start position:0%
emergency room perhaps at the same rate
 
06:08:36.708 --> 06:08:36.718 align:start position:0%
as these things two beds in a hospital
 
06:08:40.070 --> 06:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
with 25 beds or less maybe four in the
 
06:08:42.590 --> 06:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
hospital with 100 beds already in
 
06:08:44.390 --> 06:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
emergency rooms waiting for designated
 
06:08:44.400 --> 06:08:46.010 align:start position:0%
emergency rooms waiting for designated
facilities

06:08:46.010 --> 06:08:46.020 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
06:08:48.350 --> 06:08:48.360 align:start position:0%
and then you were able to designate
 
06:08:50.570 --> 06:08:50.580 align:start position:0%
facilities within the hospital would
 
06:08:52.070 --> 06:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
that enable you to get them out of the
 
06:08:54.110 --> 06:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
emergency room to get to those
 
06:08:56.510 --> 06:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
designated facilities and is there a
 
06:08:58.490 --> 06:08:58.500 align:start position:0%
steady influx of people that are sitting
 
06:09:00.948 --> 06:09:00.958 align:start position:0%
in the emergency rooms waiting the
 
06:09:02.930 --> 06:09:02.940 align:start position:0%
answer to the last question is yes the
 
06:09:05.090 --> 06:09:05.100 align:start position:0%
ability to move patients if there were
 
06:09:06.770 --> 06:09:06.780 align:start position:0%
designated receiving facility beds
 
06:09:08.288 --> 06:09:08.298 align:start position:0%
available would certainly benefit
 
06:09:10.730 --> 06:09:10.740 align:start position:0%
patients waiting in emergency rooms the
 
06:09:13.610 --> 06:09:13.620 align:start position:0%
problem is I don't believe the solution
 
06:09:17.150 --> 06:09:17.160 align:start position:0%
is going to create the pathway that
 
06:09:19.910 --> 06:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
would allow all of those hospitals to
 
06:09:21.230 --> 06:09:21.240 align:start position:0%
serve those patients because I don't
 
06:09:23.208 --> 06:09:23.218 align:start position:0%
know where those staff would come to
 
06:09:24.230 --> 06:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
serve them
 
06:09:27.110 --> 06:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
is there a need is a receiving facility
 
06:09:31.250 --> 06:09:31.260 align:start position:0%
bed like a private room with more staff
 
06:09:33.530 --> 06:09:33.540 align:start position:0%
available it requires specialized
 
06:09:35.930 --> 06:09:35.940 align:start position:0%
Services specialized staff clinicians
 
06:09:35.940 --> 06:09:37.490 align:start position:0%
Services specialized staff clinicians
facility

06:09:37.490 --> 06:09:37.500 align:start position:0%
facility
 
06:09:40.310 --> 06:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
uh you know a specialized facility where
 
06:09:43.010 --> 06:09:43.020 align:start position:0%
they can be treated safely and again
 
06:09:45.170 --> 06:09:45.180 align:start position:0%
trying to trying to do that with a
 
06:09:47.330 --> 06:09:47.340 align:start position:0%
Specialized Service with a very small
 
06:09:50.090 --> 06:09:50.100 align:start position:0%
number of beds really isn't the way we
 
06:09:51.890 --> 06:09:51.900 align:start position:0%
manage you know other specialized
 
06:09:53.448 --> 06:09:53.458 align:start position:0%
Services we don't say every hospital
 
06:09:55.330 --> 06:09:55.340 align:start position:0%
should be doing open heart surgery
 
06:09:58.010 --> 06:09:58.020 align:start position:0%
because of volumes and service and
 
06:09:59.990 --> 06:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
expertise we don't do that in those
 
06:10:01.910 --> 06:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
services and it's my view that we
 
06:10:03.770 --> 06:10:03.780 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be doing that here we have
 
06:10:05.750 --> 06:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
facilities that can do this and we need
 
06:10:07.970 --> 06:10:07.980 align:start position:0%
to focus our efforts to make sure that
 
06:10:09.890 --> 06:10:09.900 align:start position:0%
they have the resources they need to be
 
06:10:11.270 --> 06:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
able to provide those Services I was
 
06:10:12.230 --> 06:10:12.240 align:start position:0%
thinking it would give you the
 
06:10:13.548 --> 06:10:13.558 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get him out of the
 
06:10:14.990 --> 06:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
emergency room without putting them in
 
06:10:16.788 --> 06:10:16.798 align:start position:0%
an ambulance just put them in the
 
06:10:18.170 --> 06:10:18.180 align:start position:0%
elevator up another floor or whatever
 
06:10:18.180 --> 06:10:19.430 align:start position:0%
elevator up another floor or whatever
but

06:10:19.430 --> 06:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:10:21.048 --> 06:10:21.058 align:start position:0%
you know it would seem like it was a
 
06:10:22.670 --> 06:10:22.680 align:start position:0%
logical way to help get them out of the
 
06:10:24.590 --> 06:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
emergency room but then but if we don't
 
06:10:26.030 --> 06:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
have the if we don't have the the
 
06:10:27.948 --> 06:10:27.958 align:start position:0%
expertise and the Specialties to be
 
06:10:30.288 --> 06:10:30.298 align:start position:0%
Specialists specialized providers to be
 
06:10:31.788 --> 06:10:31.798 align:start position:0%
able to provide those Services I'm not
 
06:10:34.010 --> 06:10:34.020 align:start position:0%
sure what we would be where we would we
 
06:10:36.470 --> 06:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
would be taking then so I have
 
06:10:37.910 --> 06:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
represented Stringham representative
 
06:10:40.548 --> 06:10:40.558 align:start position:0%
nordgren unless you want to go first no
 
06:10:42.890 --> 06:10:42.900 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to comment there's there
 
06:10:46.070 --> 06:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
there's a huge number of issues involved
 
06:10:49.970 --> 06:10:49.980 align:start position:0%
and one of the main issues is Workforce
 
06:10:52.610 --> 06:10:52.620 align:start position:0%
um they
 
06:10:57.110 --> 06:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
they as as many other organizations and
 
06:10:59.890 --> 06:10:59.900 align:start position:0%
businesses people are retiring early
 
06:11:04.010 --> 06:11:04.020 align:start position:0%
they have closed beds because they don't
 
06:11:08.810 --> 06:11:08.820 align:start position:0%
have staff so to think that you can just
 
06:11:11.270 --> 06:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
take them out of the ER and put them in
 
06:11:14.570 --> 06:11:14.580 align:start position:0%
a bed it can't really happen all the
 
06:11:14.580 --> 06:11:16.010 align:start position:0%
a bed it can't really happen all the
time

06:11:16.010 --> 06:11:16.020 align:start position:0%
time
 
06:11:18.170 --> 06:11:18.180 align:start position:0%
representative yeah that's a good point
 
06:11:20.270 --> 06:11:20.280 align:start position:0%
just just uh you know my understanding
 
06:11:23.090 --> 06:11:23.100 align:start position:0%
and probably why this is stuck so late
 
06:11:27.590 --> 06:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
in the hb2 is this came out of of
 
06:11:30.430 --> 06:11:30.440 align:start position:0%
um a stronger need because of an adverse
 
06:11:33.890 --> 06:11:33.900 align:start position:0%
decision for the state in regard to
 
06:11:37.310 --> 06:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
where uh people who are involuntarily
 
06:11:39.890 --> 06:11:39.900 align:start position:0%
admitted or undergoing a mental health
 
06:11:42.350 --> 06:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
crisis are being parked in emergency
 
06:11:44.448 --> 06:11:44.458 align:start position:0%
room so it's not just a matter of the
 
06:11:46.250 --> 06:11:46.260 align:start position:0%
hospital having a bed it has to have a
 
06:11:49.070 --> 06:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
bed that takes care of and provides the
 
06:11:51.850 --> 06:11:51.860 align:start position:0%
services needed for emergency
 
06:11:56.448 --> 06:11:56.458 align:start position:0%
mental crisis admissions first of all is
 
06:11:59.390 --> 06:11:59.400 align:start position:0%
that that correct so so you know the
 
06:12:01.390 --> 06:12:01.400 align:start position:0%
state essentially is
 
06:12:05.510 --> 06:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
you know facing uh potential potential
 
06:12:07.490 --> 06:12:07.500 align:start position:0%
payments for hospitals who have been
 
06:12:09.948 --> 06:12:09.958 align:start position:0%
without their permission basically asked
 
06:12:13.490 --> 06:12:13.500 align:start position:0%
to take care of these patients in
 
06:12:17.208 --> 06:12:17.218 align:start position:0%
inappropriate facilities and so this was
 
06:12:20.030 --> 06:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
one way to try to open up more possible
 
06:12:22.070 --> 06:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
facilities I think it was thrown in here
 
06:12:25.490 --> 06:12:25.500 align:start position:0%
pretty pretty late in the game and and
 
06:12:28.610 --> 06:12:28.620 align:start position:0%
um uh and so I'm just wondering if if
 
06:12:31.310 --> 06:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
you've heard of anything to try to uh
 
06:12:33.650 --> 06:12:33.660 align:start position:0%
solve that issue
 
06:12:37.430 --> 06:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
um uh you know aside from forcing every
 
06:12:40.128 --> 06:12:40.138 align:start position:0%
hospital in the state other than the
 
06:12:43.910 --> 06:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
couple of excluded categories uh to uh
 
06:12:47.030 --> 06:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
to open up open up beds depending on
 
06:12:48.890 --> 06:12:48.900 align:start position:0%
their size is there a better solution or
 
06:12:51.470 --> 06:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
anything underway right now where are we
 
06:12:53.750 --> 06:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
on that there are
 
06:12:56.270 --> 06:12:56.280 align:start position:0%
there are a number of solutions that are
 
06:12:58.430 --> 06:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
necessary to solve the the Ed boarding
 
06:13:00.110 --> 06:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
crisis and there are a number of efforts
 
06:13:01.430 --> 06:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
that have been ongoing the 10-year
 
06:13:03.410 --> 06:13:03.420 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Plan and others that are
 
06:13:05.570 --> 06:13:05.580 align:start position:0%
you know building out uh communities
 
06:13:08.868 --> 06:13:08.878 align:start position:0%
based system of supports from beginning
 
06:13:11.270 --> 06:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
to end right it helped mental health is
 
06:13:12.650 --> 06:13:12.660 align:start position:0%
a Continuum so we need to provide
 
06:13:14.810 --> 06:13:14.820 align:start position:0%
services on an outpatient basis so we
 
06:13:17.270 --> 06:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
can treat people before they become get
 
06:13:18.830 --> 06:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
into a crisis when they get into crisis
 
06:13:20.750 --> 06:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
we can step in with mobile crisis and
 
06:13:22.128 --> 06:13:22.138 align:start position:0%
Crisis Intervention when they need
 
06:13:24.048 --> 06:13:24.058 align:start position:0%
inpatient Services we have that and we
 
06:13:26.750 --> 06:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
have Services Post Acute Care
 
06:13:28.788 --> 06:13:28.798 align:start position:0%
um we need all of that and we needed it
 
06:13:30.948 --> 06:13:30.958 align:start position:0%
yesterday but there's no solution that
 
06:13:32.810 --> 06:13:32.820 align:start position:0%
doesn't require additional inpatient
 
06:13:36.288 --> 06:13:36.298 align:start position:0%
capacity yes there has been ongoing
 
06:13:38.208 --> 06:13:38.218 align:start position:0%
litigation there was a decision
 
06:13:39.890 --> 06:13:39.900 align:start position:0%
um recently that
 
06:13:42.350 --> 06:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
my senses probably spurred some of this
 
06:13:44.628 --> 06:13:44.638 align:start position:0%
on but the reality is we've got to find
 
06:13:46.970 --> 06:13:46.980 align:start position:0%
a way to do this and we understand that
 
06:13:48.890 --> 06:13:48.900 align:start position:0%
we understand a bed doesn't get created
 
06:13:50.810 --> 06:13:50.820 align:start position:0%
overnight and we've been more than
 
06:13:52.670 --> 06:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
willing to sit down and find a way to
 
06:13:54.288 --> 06:13:54.298 align:start position:0%
solve that problem and get to a point
 
06:13:56.448 --> 06:13:56.458 align:start position:0%
where we can say
 
06:13:58.788 --> 06:13:58.798 align:start position:0%
at some point in the future in the very
 
06:14:01.190 --> 06:14:01.200 align:start position:0%
near future Edie boarding will not
 
06:14:02.990 --> 06:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
happen and patients suffering an acute
 
06:14:04.128 --> 06:14:04.138 align:start position:0%
psychiatric crisis are going to be able
 
06:14:05.690 --> 06:14:05.700 align:start position:0%
to get the care they need because that's
 
06:14:07.788 --> 06:14:07.798 align:start position:0%
what this is about you know that's what
 
06:14:09.470 --> 06:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
this is about this is about patients and
 
06:14:12.708 --> 06:14:12.718 align:start position:0%
families in crisis and we we absolutely
 
06:14:14.330 --> 06:14:14.340 align:start position:0%
want to help get there and I think
 
06:14:16.368 --> 06:14:16.378 align:start position:0%
there's a path to to do that and we need
 
06:14:17.750 --> 06:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
to get there and we need to get there
 
06:14:17.760 --> 06:14:18.708 align:start position:0%
to get there and we need to get there
soon

06:14:18.708 --> 06:14:18.718 align:start position:0%
soon
 
06:14:21.170 --> 06:14:21.180 align:start position:0%
so I want to thank you for volunteering
 
06:14:23.510 --> 06:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
your testimony it was you know nobody
 
06:14:25.250 --> 06:14:25.260 align:start position:0%
anticipated you being here it was very
 
06:14:29.330 --> 06:14:29.340 align:start position:0%
helpful uh I would like to have a straw
 
06:14:32.208 --> 06:14:32.218 align:start position:0%
vote representative Weiler's not here I
 
06:14:34.368 --> 06:14:34.378 align:start position:0%
don't I don't think he probably needs to
 
06:14:36.110 --> 06:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
be for this but
 
06:14:39.288 --> 06:14:39.298 align:start position:0%
um what I would like us to strive out is
 
06:14:42.890 --> 06:14:42.900 align:start position:0%
the removal of items
 
06:14:45.650 --> 06:14:45.660 align:start position:0%
282 and 283.
 
06:14:47.350 --> 06:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
from hb2
 
06:14:51.708 --> 06:14:51.718 align:start position:0%
if you are opposed to that you can speak
 
06:14:54.530 --> 06:14:54.540 align:start position:0%
now if you're in favor will probably
 
06:14:56.868 --> 06:14:56.878 align:start position:0%
take a vote in just a moment anyone
 
06:14:56.878 --> 06:14:58.128 align:start position:0%
take a vote in just a moment anyone
opposed

06:14:58.128 --> 06:14:58.138 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
06:15:00.170 --> 06:15:00.180 align:start position:0%
question I know I stepped out of the
 
06:15:01.548 --> 06:15:01.558 align:start position:0%
room for a brief moment we haven't
 
06:15:04.610 --> 06:15:04.620 align:start position:0%
touched on 284 yet right
 
06:15:07.190 --> 06:15:07.200 align:start position:0%
okay thank you you can go ahead with
 
06:15:12.288 --> 06:15:12.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:16.128 --> 06:15:16.138 align:start position:0%
I I meant to say 282 and 284 that we
 
06:15:18.350 --> 06:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
would just remove them wait wait wait
 
06:15:20.150 --> 06:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
what am I doing
 
06:15:23.510 --> 06:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
right you said 32 and 283 which is
 
06:15:25.070 --> 06:15:25.080 align:start position:0%
correct I just wanted to make sure that
 
06:15:26.868 --> 06:15:26.878 align:start position:0%
we didn't discuss 284 when I was out of
 
06:15:27.890 --> 06:15:27.900 align:start position:0%
the room because that is somewhat
 
06:15:30.410 --> 06:15:30.420 align:start position:0%
related so we can move ahead with just
 
06:15:33.890 --> 06:15:33.900 align:start position:0%
two and three okay so that's right so if
 
06:15:37.070 --> 06:15:37.080 align:start position:0%
you are in favor of removing 282 and 283
 
06:15:39.770 --> 06:15:39.780 align:start position:0%
raise your hand
 
06:15:41.990 --> 06:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
okay very good
 
06:15:42.000 --> 06:15:43.070 align:start position:0%
okay very good
um

06:15:43.070 --> 06:15:43.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:15:50.628 --> 06:15:50.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:53.150 --> 06:15:53.160 align:start position:0%
statutory provision relative to
 
06:15:55.430 --> 06:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
involuntary emergency admission to
 
06:15:58.010 --> 06:15:58.020 align:start position:0%
receiving facilities
 
06:16:00.230 --> 06:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
what do we what what are we doing with
 
06:16:02.208 --> 06:16:02.218 align:start position:0%
this Mr Ripple what does I forget what
 
06:16:05.090 --> 06:16:05.100 align:start position:0%
this does one word or do you want Mr
 
06:16:13.310 --> 06:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:16.628 --> 06:16:16.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:19.670 --> 06:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
sure I I believe when this was put
 
06:16:21.410 --> 06:16:21.420 align:start position:0%
forward that this is part this is
 
06:16:25.190 --> 06:16:25.200 align:start position:0%
associated with the 282 and 283 sections
 
06:16:26.868 --> 06:16:26.878 align:start position:0%
um this specifically strikes the
 
06:16:26.878 --> 06:16:28.548 align:start position:0%
um this specifically strikes the
language

06:16:28.548 --> 06:16:28.558 align:start position:0%
language
 
06:16:28.558 --> 06:16:29.810 align:start position:0%
language
um

06:16:29.810 --> 06:16:29.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:16:33.530 --> 06:16:33.540 align:start position:0%
you you'll it strikes immediately so uh
 
06:16:35.750 --> 06:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
when you when you take custody of the
 
06:16:38.030 --> 06:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
person to be admitted and shall be
 
06:16:40.250 --> 06:16:40.260 align:start position:0%
immediately delivered uh such a person
 
06:16:42.410 --> 06:16:42.420 align:start position:0%
to a receiving facility
 
06:16:46.970 --> 06:16:46.980 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:49.190 --> 06:16:49.200 align:start position:0%
so so that's pretty simple it just
 
06:16:52.448 --> 06:16:52.458 align:start position:0%
hinges on the issue of whether or not
 
06:16:55.490 --> 06:16:55.500 align:start position:0%
requiring an immediate action in this
 
06:16:58.190 --> 06:16:58.200 align:start position:0%
environment is actually something that
 
06:16:59.570 --> 06:16:59.580 align:start position:0%
can be done
 
06:17:02.570 --> 06:17:02.580 align:start position:0%
right I I mean I think the reason that
 
06:17:04.610 --> 06:17:04.620 align:start position:0%
the word immediately is being proposed
 
06:17:07.190 --> 06:17:07.200 align:start position:0%
for deletion is because we just don't
 
06:17:10.250 --> 06:17:10.260 align:start position:0%
have the capacity now to be able to
 
06:17:12.530 --> 06:17:12.540 align:start position:0%
move people immediately because there's
 
06:17:14.990 --> 06:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
not somewhere to take them is that is
 
06:17:17.690 --> 06:17:17.700 align:start position:0%
that the correct understanding of why
 
06:17:20.708 --> 06:17:20.718 align:start position:0%
this proposal is coming forward
 
06:17:23.208 --> 06:17:23.218 align:start position:0%
I think I would probably want the chief
 
06:17:25.250 --> 06:17:25.260 align:start position:0%
legal counsel here to have a
 
06:17:27.170 --> 06:17:27.180 align:start position:0%
conversation about this
 
06:17:31.610 --> 06:17:31.620 align:start position:0%
okay does does anyone have any thoughts
 
06:17:39.650 --> 06:17:39.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:42.048 --> 06:17:42.058 align:start position:0%
and also are you in favor of leaving it
 
06:17:43.368 --> 06:17:43.378 align:start position:0%
or killing it
 
06:17:44.448 --> 06:17:44.458 align:start position:0%
um thank you again Steven and president
 
06:17:46.310 --> 06:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
Hospital Association I absolutely
 
06:17:48.590 --> 06:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
believe this provision should be removed
 
06:17:50.448 --> 06:17:50.458 align:start position:0%
um you know when a patient is in crisis
 
06:17:53.448 --> 06:17:53.458 align:start position:0%
they need care and the statute has been
 
06:17:55.128 --> 06:17:55.138 align:start position:0%
very clear that we should be doing that
 
06:17:56.448 --> 06:17:56.458 align:start position:0%
right away
 
06:17:58.548 --> 06:17:58.558 align:start position:0%
um and you know for 10 years we've had a
 
06:18:00.708 --> 06:18:00.718 align:start position:0%
wait list and we've told patients that
 
06:18:02.270 --> 06:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
they needed to wait and I don't think we
 
06:18:04.548 --> 06:18:04.558 align:start position:0%
should continue to tell people to wait
 
06:18:06.650 --> 06:18:06.660 align:start position:0%
um just because we're having trouble now
 
06:18:08.690 --> 06:18:08.700 align:start position:0%
we need to be able to get to a point
 
06:18:11.570 --> 06:18:11.580 align:start position:0%
where we can transport people
 
06:18:13.010 --> 06:18:13.020 align:start position:0%
um so that they can get the care that
 
06:18:14.690 --> 06:18:14.700 align:start position:0%
they need and I I don't think this
 
06:18:16.310 --> 06:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
provision should remain so you're
 
06:18:19.310 --> 06:18:19.320 align:start position:0%
opposed okay so so now if you would just
 
06:18:21.410 --> 06:18:21.420 align:start position:0%
take the intellectual exercise and flip
 
06:18:23.868 --> 06:18:23.878 align:start position:0%
it around and make the argument of
 
06:18:26.330 --> 06:18:26.340 align:start position:0%
whoever wanted to strike the word
 
06:18:27.890 --> 06:18:27.900 align:start position:0%
immediately what do you think they were
 
06:18:29.810 --> 06:18:29.820 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish and we're trying to
 
06:18:29.820 --> 06:18:31.490 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish and we're trying to
avoid

06:18:31.490 --> 06:18:31.500 align:start position:0%
avoid
 
06:18:33.548 --> 06:18:33.558 align:start position:0%
um the obligation to provide that
 
06:18:37.610 --> 06:18:37.620 align:start position:0%
service and transport uh immediately and
 
06:18:40.070 --> 06:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
I think that's not the right approach I
 
06:18:42.770 --> 06:18:42.780 align:start position:0%
I get that but stay in the other
 
06:18:45.070 --> 06:18:45.080 align:start position:0%
person's frame of mind for a moment
 
06:18:48.470 --> 06:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
why why would they not want to do it
 
06:18:50.390 --> 06:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
immediately what is getting in their way
 
06:18:52.970 --> 06:18:52.980 align:start position:0%
what what it would absolve them are they
 
06:18:55.610 --> 06:18:55.620 align:start position:0%
legal requirement to do so and to do so
 
06:18:55.620 --> 06:18:58.670 align:start position:0%
legal requirement to do so and to do so
immediately

06:18:58.670 --> 06:18:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:01.610 --> 06:19:01.620 align:start position:0%
okay all right well uh thank you does
 
06:19:03.770 --> 06:19:03.780 align:start position:0%
anyone have any I think I think we
 
06:19:07.010 --> 06:19:07.020 align:start position:0%
probably need to wait on 284 uh you said
 
06:19:08.868 --> 06:19:08.878 align:start position:0%
do we should get the chief legal counsel
 
06:19:10.910 --> 06:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
to come could we get the chief legal
 
06:19:13.548 --> 06:19:13.558 align:start position:0%
counsel to come Monday what time do we
 
06:19:15.530 --> 06:19:15.540 align:start position:0%
start Mr Ripple on Monday
 
06:19:17.150 --> 06:19:17.160 align:start position:0%
10 o'clock
 
06:19:20.510 --> 06:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
10 o'clock okay well I I think we can
 
06:19:23.510 --> 06:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
try to start go ahead what
 
06:19:23.520 --> 06:19:26.150 align:start position:0%
try to start go ahead what
okay

06:19:26.150 --> 06:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:29.330 --> 06:19:29.340 align:start position:0%
okay so if if the chief legal counsel
 
06:19:32.750 --> 06:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
come is that uh sear cyr
 
06:19:34.610 --> 06:19:34.620 align:start position:0%
Melissa sincere
 
06:19:36.230 --> 06:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
06:19:39.048 --> 06:19:39.058 align:start position:0%
um we'll try to have her in and out and
 
06:19:41.270 --> 06:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
just talking about 284 and then we can
 
06:19:44.948 --> 06:19:44.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:49.780 --> 06:19:49.790 align:start position:0%
all right so what's the new new stuff
 
06:19:49.790 --> 06:19:52.190 align:start position:0%
all right so what's the new new stuff
[Music]

06:19:52.190 --> 06:19:52.200 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:19:55.430 --> 06:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
well I only have a few
 
06:19:56.990 --> 06:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
there are a few others that will be
 
06:20:02.270 --> 06:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:04.850 --> 06:20:04.860 align:start position:0%
so so I propose for the new new items
 
06:20:06.590 --> 06:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
things that I don't think we've talked
 
06:20:09.230 --> 06:20:09.240 align:start position:0%
about really and in the discussion until
 
06:20:11.330 --> 06:20:11.340 align:start position:0%
we see paper just doesn't really count
 
06:20:14.868 --> 06:20:14.878 align:start position:0%
anyways so I propose that we just do an
 
06:20:16.850 --> 06:20:16.860 align:start position:0%
introduction familiarization of what
 
06:20:19.190 --> 06:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
these are and what's the Thought is and
 
06:20:22.970 --> 06:20:22.980 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:26.930 --> 06:20:26.940 align:start position:0%
so actually there are two of yours that
 
06:20:28.670 --> 06:20:28.680 align:start position:0%
I like to like to show you before
 
06:20:31.850 --> 06:20:31.860 align:start position:0%
they're introduced publicly
 
06:20:34.730 --> 06:20:34.740 align:start position:0%
oh did I screw up no I just want to make
 
06:20:36.288 --> 06:20:36.298 align:start position:0%
sure that you want them to move it out
 
06:20:39.708 --> 06:20:39.718 align:start position:0%
right now so I'll want one I'll meet you
 
06:20:42.530 --> 06:20:42.540 align:start position:0%
and we're going to take a a three-minute
 
06:20:42.540 --> 06:20:43.670 align:start position:0%
and we're going to take a a three-minute
recess

06:20:43.670 --> 06:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
recess
 
06:20:43.680 --> 06:34:24.010 align:start position:0%
recess
foreign

06:34:24.010 --> 06:34:24.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:24.020 --> 06:34:25.670 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:34:25.670 --> 06:34:25.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:34:27.170 --> 06:34:27.180 align:start position:0%
um that was more than a three-minute
 
06:34:30.110 --> 06:34:30.120 align:start position:0%
recess but uh
 
06:34:33.110 --> 06:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
but I I think everyone got quite a lot
 
06:34:36.350 --> 06:34:36.360 align:start position:0%
actually done so where where are we
 
06:34:38.628 --> 06:34:38.638 align:start position:0%
we're in the we are literally in the
 
06:34:41.510 --> 06:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
final stretch if you didn't stretch you
 
06:34:43.670 --> 06:34:43.680 align:start position:0%
should have but but
 
06:34:45.230 --> 06:34:45.240 align:start position:0%
um what
 
06:34:47.448 --> 06:34:47.458 align:start position:0%
I had considered doing
 
06:34:47.458 --> 06:34:48.850 align:start position:0%
I had considered doing
was

06:34:48.850 --> 06:34:48.860 align:start position:0%
was
 
06:34:53.270 --> 06:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
introducing two amendments that are are
 
06:34:55.850 --> 06:34:55.860 align:start position:0%
sort of ready but
 
06:34:58.910 --> 06:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
I don't think the timing's right so uh
 
06:35:01.430 --> 06:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
and I understand there may be some some
 
06:35:04.190 --> 06:35:04.200 align:start position:0%
other amendments that that we won't see
 
06:35:06.770 --> 06:35:06.780 align:start position:0%
until Monday
 
06:35:09.650 --> 06:35:09.660 align:start position:0%
which which the only issue with that is
 
06:35:11.628 --> 06:35:11.638 align:start position:0%
I've been trying to give us the weekend
 
06:35:15.010 --> 06:35:15.020 align:start position:0%
to think about things but that's okay
 
06:35:18.110 --> 06:35:18.120 align:start position:0%
from your understanding of what you
 
06:35:20.448 --> 06:35:20.458 align:start position:0%
might be bringing forward is it
 
06:35:22.010 --> 06:35:22.020 align:start position:0%
something that we should I should just
 
06:35:24.770 --> 06:35:24.780 align:start position:0%
anticipate we discuss on Monday and we
 
06:35:28.250 --> 06:35:28.260 align:start position:0%
come back on Tuesday to vote or is it so
 
06:35:30.650 --> 06:35:30.660 align:start position:0%
simple and so obvious that we're all
 
06:35:30.660 --> 06:35:34.010 align:start position:0%
simple and so obvious that we're all
gonna

06:35:34.010 --> 06:35:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:38.208 --> 06:35:38.218 align:start position:0%
okay so I'll schedule Tuesday for those
 
06:35:38.218 --> 06:35:40.628 align:start position:0%
okay so I'll schedule Tuesday for those
laughs

06:35:40.628 --> 06:35:40.638 align:start position:0%
laughs
 
06:35:44.810 --> 06:35:44.820 align:start position:0%
yeah okay got it
 
06:35:47.750 --> 06:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
um so so so then that's it I think we
 
06:35:49.970 --> 06:35:49.980 align:start position:0%
did a a good job of getting all the way
 
06:35:53.868 --> 06:35:53.878 align:start position:0%
through uh the open hb2 items
 
06:35:58.070 --> 06:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
um so so thank you let's uh Mr Ripple
 
06:36:00.890 --> 06:36:00.900 align:start position:0%
reminded me he gave me a flashback if
 
06:36:03.288 --> 06:36:03.298 align:start position:0%
you'll remember that we had a pretty
 
06:36:06.170 --> 06:36:06.180 align:start position:0%
good conversation going over this
 
06:36:09.530 --> 06:36:09.540 align:start position:0%
document it's a long spreadsheet and
 
06:36:12.048 --> 06:36:12.058 align:start position:0%
it's uh got two pages front and back
 
06:36:14.390 --> 06:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
it's called Department of Health and
 
06:36:16.788 --> 06:36:16.798 align:start position:0%
Human Services adjustment to Governor's
 
06:36:19.128 --> 06:36:19.138 align:start position:0%
budget summary request by source of
 
06:36:22.010 --> 06:36:22.020 align:start position:0%
funds if you find your copy it'll
 
06:36:24.770 --> 06:36:24.780 align:start position:0%
probably have some notes on it because I
 
06:36:27.230 --> 06:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
think we went all the way through the
 
06:36:32.270 --> 06:36:32.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:36.610 --> 06:36:36.620 align:start position:0%
yep and then we got onto the second page
 
06:36:40.368 --> 06:36:40.378 align:start position:0%
where DHHS had some prioritized needs
 
06:36:43.970 --> 06:36:43.980 align:start position:0%
and then there were other DHHS requests
 
06:36:47.650 --> 06:36:47.660 align:start position:0%
and and frankly I'm oblivious where we
 
06:36:51.350 --> 06:36:51.360 align:start position:0%
stopped off on the DHHS prioritized
 
06:36:53.570 --> 06:36:53.580 align:start position:0%
needs well I remember these were pretty
 
06:36:55.610 --> 06:36:55.620 align:start position:0%
pretty big numbers and that we hadn't
 
06:36:57.770 --> 06:36:57.780 align:start position:0%
decided on any of them
 
06:36:57.780 --> 06:36:59.868 align:start position:0%
decided on any of them
so

06:36:59.868 --> 06:36:59.878 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:37:01.610 --> 06:37:01.620 align:start position:0%
I think that's right I think one thing
 
06:37:03.048 --> 06:37:03.058 align:start position:0%
that you could consider doing is looking
 
06:37:05.690 --> 06:37:05.700 align:start position:0%
at the other HHS requests a few of these
 
06:37:07.490 --> 06:37:07.500 align:start position:0%
probably would be pretty pretty easy to
 
06:37:09.890 --> 06:37:09.900 align:start position:0%
vote on this afternoon there will be
 
06:37:11.470 --> 06:37:11.480 align:start position:0%
some that will have to remain on hold
 
06:37:14.208 --> 06:37:14.218 align:start position:0%
but for example
 
06:37:17.208 --> 06:37:17.218 align:start position:0%
uh item number 24 the change request for
 
06:37:20.030 --> 06:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
food protection adds 17 400 in general
 
06:37:22.368 --> 06:37:22.378 align:start position:0%
funds each year and if you look at the
 
06:37:24.170 --> 06:37:24.180 align:start position:0%
description that's because class 18 was
 
06:37:25.430 --> 06:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
inadvertently reduced during the
 
06:37:27.890 --> 06:37:27.900 align:start position:0%
governor's phase and also if you recall
 
06:37:30.470 --> 06:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
HHS came in and had a prioritize need
 
06:37:33.288 --> 06:37:33.298 align:start position:0%
which I think was for overtime is that
 
06:37:35.628 --> 06:37:35.638 align:start position:0%
correct yes yeah and we've sort of
 
06:37:38.208 --> 06:37:38.218 align:start position:0%
approved that on the Fly Right
 
06:37:40.610 --> 06:37:40.620 align:start position:0%
so this this might be an item that you
 
06:37:41.868 --> 06:37:41.878 align:start position:0%
could take a look at and vote on now
 
06:37:43.970 --> 06:37:43.980 align:start position:0%
okay what else
 
06:37:46.368 --> 06:37:46.378 align:start position:0%
I think 25 Family Planning may have to
 
06:37:48.650 --> 06:37:48.660 align:start position:0%
wait uh representative erf has an
 
06:37:49.910 --> 06:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
amendment to that that I don't have
 
06:37:52.128 --> 06:37:52.138 align:start position:0%
ready yet I think the prescription drug
 
06:37:53.868 --> 06:37:53.878 align:start position:0%
affordability board and the sununu
 
06:37:55.670 --> 06:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
center may happen so let's stop on
 
06:37:58.190 --> 06:37:58.200 align:start position:0%
family planning for a second this is
 
06:38:00.410 --> 06:38:00.420 align:start position:0%
also the one where I suggested raising
 
06:38:03.590 --> 06:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
the amount from 50 000 to
 
06:38:06.070 --> 06:38:06.080 align:start position:0%
a hundred thousand with twenty thousand
 
06:38:08.810 --> 06:38:08.820 align:start position:0%
incentive for new vendors that's correct
 
06:38:11.030 --> 06:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
do we have that being written anywhere
 
06:38:14.208 --> 06:38:14.218 align:start position:0%
it's I don't have it available right now
 
06:38:16.970 --> 06:38:16.980 align:start position:0%
and representative verf's amendment is
 
06:38:20.628 --> 06:38:20.638 align:start position:0%
it completed is it out of OLS it is not
 
06:38:22.310 --> 06:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
it'll be available both of those will be
 
06:38:24.230 --> 06:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
ready on Monday
 
06:38:29.270 --> 06:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:31.850 --> 06:38:31.860 align:start position:0%
mine is very simple I can describe it as
 
06:38:34.430 --> 06:38:34.440 align:start position:0%
I can think about it my question was are
 
06:38:37.548 --> 06:38:37.558 align:start position:0%
you open so that we do one Amendment or
 
06:38:39.650 --> 06:38:39.660 align:start position:0%
should we do two members mine amends
 
06:38:40.670 --> 06:38:40.680 align:start position:0%
federal funds there's defense General
 
06:38:44.030 --> 06:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
funds okay let's do two amendments I was
 
06:38:45.530 --> 06:38:45.540 align:start position:0%
thinking if we could just merge the
 
06:38:47.930 --> 06:38:47.940 align:start position:0%
Amendments it's just easier but it's not
 
06:38:47.940 --> 06:38:49.310 align:start position:0%
Amendments it's just easier but it's not
necessary

06:38:49.310 --> 06:38:49.320 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
06:38:52.250 --> 06:38:52.260 align:start position:0%
and it may not help okay so then there's
 
06:38:54.350 --> 06:38:54.360 align:start position:0%
the pdab and I think that one will have
 
06:38:55.910 --> 06:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
to wait uh we're waiting on a house bill
 
06:38:58.128 --> 06:38:58.138 align:start position:0%
2 amendment to that what are we okay so
 
06:39:00.708 --> 06:39:00.718 align:start position:0%
there is a big Amendment on the pdab yes
 
06:39:05.090 --> 06:39:05.100 align:start position:0%
okay Anna and allocation of General
 
06:39:08.628 --> 06:39:08.638 align:start position:0%
funds in anticipation of the portion of
 
06:39:12.530 --> 06:39:12.540 align:start position:0%
hb2 that changes their feast and fine
 
06:39:15.230 --> 06:39:15.240 align:start position:0%
structure to General funds that's
 
06:39:16.910 --> 06:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
correct okay
 
06:39:20.750 --> 06:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
now when we bring that forward
 
06:39:22.930 --> 06:39:22.940 align:start position:0%
do you happen to have the gel car
 
06:39:25.910 --> 06:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
transcript that goes with it so that
 
06:39:28.670 --> 06:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
folks realize that it was a bipartisan
 
06:39:30.770 --> 06:39:30.780 align:start position:0%
agreement that the fees were
 
06:39:32.930 --> 06:39:32.940 align:start position:0%
inappropriate and that the legislature
 
06:39:35.208 --> 06:39:35.218 align:start position:0%
ought to relook them I I can print out
 
06:39:36.890 --> 06:39:36.900 align:start position:0%
more copies I think I distributed that
 
06:39:38.810 --> 06:39:38.820 align:start position:0%
during the original discussion but the
 
06:39:40.730 --> 06:39:40.740 align:start position:0%
jail car transcript has been distributed
 
06:39:42.650 --> 06:39:42.660 align:start position:0%
yes okay
 
06:39:48.470 --> 06:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:50.208 --> 06:39:50.218 align:start position:0%
I think this new new center will have to
 
06:39:51.650 --> 06:39:51.660 align:start position:0%
wait that was already talked about today
 
06:39:51.660 --> 06:39:53.270 align:start position:0%
wait that was already talked about today
yeah

06:39:53.270 --> 06:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:39:56.030 --> 06:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
uh line 28 New Hampshire hospital
 
06:39:58.010 --> 06:39:58.020 align:start position:0%
facilities and patient support this was
 
06:40:00.650 --> 06:40:00.660 align:start position:0%
a request a general fund request of 150
 
06:40:02.270 --> 06:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
000 per year which is why I put it in
 
06:40:05.208 --> 06:40:05.218 align:start position:0%
the other category uh it's for PPE and
 
06:40:08.690 --> 06:40:08.700 align:start position:0%
clinical Supply related costs okay so we
 
06:40:11.208 --> 06:40:11.218 align:start position:0%
had Federal money buying all the PPE but
 
06:40:13.190 --> 06:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
before there was a pandemic there was a
 
06:40:14.810 --> 06:40:14.820 align:start position:0%
need for PPE
 
06:40:18.530 --> 06:40:18.540 align:start position:0%
so is this an issue of just our needing
 
06:40:22.670 --> 06:40:22.680 align:start position:0%
to get our our PPE consumption straight
 
06:40:26.330 --> 06:40:26.340 align:start position:0%
and budgeted or why why are we doing an
 
06:40:29.628 --> 06:40:29.638 align:start position:0%
out of budget thing for PPE sure yeah
 
06:40:32.448 --> 06:40:32.458 align:start position:0%
this the the this was identified late in
 
06:40:33.948 --> 06:40:33.958 align:start position:0%
the game and I'll attribute this to my
 
06:40:33.958 --> 06:40:35.510 align:start position:0%
the game and I'll attribute this to my
inexperience

06:40:35.510 --> 06:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
inexperience
 
06:40:38.090 --> 06:40:38.100 align:start position:0%
um so basically many of the requirements
 
06:40:40.910 --> 06:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
around PPE have continued uh New
 
06:40:43.610 --> 06:40:43.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital has had outbreaks uh
 
06:40:45.650 --> 06:40:45.660 align:start position:0%
over the past year
 
06:40:49.190 --> 06:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
um and and to date uh we've spent 182
 
06:40:51.530 --> 06:40:51.540 align:start position:0%
000 on PPE annualized over the Year
 
06:40:54.048 --> 06:40:54.058 align:start position:0%
we're projecting about 274 thousand
 
06:40:57.530 --> 06:40:57.540 align:start position:0%
dollars in costs associated to that this
 
06:41:01.128 --> 06:41:01.138 align:start position:0%
request is to help uh mitigate some of
 
06:41:02.930 --> 06:41:02.940 align:start position:0%
those costs in the future will likely
 
06:41:05.510 --> 06:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
transfer funds from wherever we can find
 
06:41:08.868 --> 06:41:08.878 align:start position:0%
them to cover the other costs as we cut
 
06:41:11.390 --> 06:41:11.400 align:start position:0%
we at this point in time we expect many
 
06:41:13.850 --> 06:41:13.860 align:start position:0%
of those requirements to remain in place
 
06:41:16.368 --> 06:41:16.378 align:start position:0%
okay so have any of your clinical people
 
06:41:18.530 --> 06:41:18.540 align:start position:0%
let you know that they think that the
 
06:41:21.230 --> 06:41:21.240 align:start position:0%
we're at a new normal at PPE consumption
 
06:41:23.330 --> 06:41:23.340 align:start position:0%
to where it's going to for as far as the
 
06:41:25.850 --> 06:41:25.860 align:start position:0%
eye can see be it a higher consumption
 
06:41:25.860 --> 06:41:28.250 align:start position:0%
eye can see be it a higher consumption
rate

06:41:28.250 --> 06:41:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:31.628 --> 06:41:31.638 align:start position:0%
um or will we be going back to normal
 
06:41:35.030 --> 06:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that for the for the
 
06:41:38.150 --> 06:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
at least for the foreseeable future
 
06:41:40.070 --> 06:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
um this is the new normal
 
06:41:43.670 --> 06:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
okay uh what's going on with 29 then or
 
06:41:45.170 --> 06:41:45.180 align:start position:0%
do you have a question go ahead no I
 
06:41:47.690 --> 06:41:47.700 align:start position:0%
just wanted to comment
 
06:41:51.170 --> 06:41:51.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:53.690 --> 06:41:53.700 align:start position:0%
Department of Hitchcock and they think
 
06:41:56.650 --> 06:41:56.660 align:start position:0%
PPE and wearing
 
06:42:00.770 --> 06:42:00.780 align:start position:0%
gloves and masks is gonna go on forever
 
06:42:00.780 --> 06:42:04.910 align:start position:0%
gloves and masks is gonna go on forever
so

06:42:04.910 --> 06:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:07.310 --> 06:42:07.320 align:start position:0%
I would be okay with that if they have
 
06:42:09.548 --> 06:42:09.558 align:start position:0%
the signs to show it actually reduces
 
06:42:14.628 --> 06:42:14.638 align:start position:0%
infectious disease spread but you know
 
06:42:16.910 --> 06:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
if it's science
 
06:42:21.110 --> 06:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
all right so what's 29 29 has no net
 
06:42:22.970 --> 06:42:22.980 align:start position:0%
cost it's just a movement of funds from
 
06:42:25.910 --> 06:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
class 59 to class 10 but related to that
 
06:42:28.070 --> 06:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
it does it is a request to convert 21
 
06:42:30.110 --> 06:42:30.120 align:start position:0%
full-time temporary positions to
 
06:42:32.150 --> 06:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
full-time authorized and so for this
 
06:42:33.650 --> 06:42:33.660 align:start position:0%
reason I separated it out from the
 
06:42:37.430 --> 06:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:40.310 --> 06:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
okay so far what I have in my notes is
 
06:42:42.230 --> 06:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
we probably want to hold
 
06:42:44.868 --> 06:42:44.878 align:start position:0%
the Family Planning I think we need to
 
06:42:47.090 --> 06:42:47.100 align:start position:0%
hold this one for discussion
 
06:42:49.910 --> 06:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
did did everything else seem to flow oh
 
06:42:52.850 --> 06:42:52.860 align:start position:0%
we're holding the pdab
 
06:42:54.890 --> 06:42:54.900 align:start position:0%
well I know but I I'm actually getting
 
06:42:57.410 --> 06:42:57.420 align:start position:0%
ready to loop back and and vote on some
 
06:42:59.390 --> 06:42:59.400 align:start position:0%
of them in just a moment I'm just I I'm
 
06:43:01.310 --> 06:43:01.320 align:start position:0%
just thinking of the ones that I think
 
06:43:03.890 --> 06:43:03.900 align:start position:0%
we definitely have to hold I think so
 
06:43:07.788 --> 06:43:07.798 align:start position:0%
far you'd want to hold on 25 26 27.
 
06:43:10.250 --> 06:43:10.260 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm not sure about 29. oh well
 
06:43:13.128 --> 06:43:13.138 align:start position:0%
29 we need to hold I think and then on
 
06:43:16.850 --> 06:43:16.860 align:start position:0%
27 we decided to hold that oh yeah right
 
06:43:20.448 --> 06:43:20.458 align:start position:0%
all right so then we're on 30.
 
06:43:23.090 --> 06:43:23.100 align:start position:0%
and 30 is just an increase of 11 000 per
 
06:43:25.128 --> 06:43:25.138 align:start position:0%
year for copier costs resulting from new
 
06:43:26.930 --> 06:43:26.940 align:start position:0%
procurement again I only threw it on
 
06:43:28.670 --> 06:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
here because however small it was a
 
06:43:30.470 --> 06:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
general fund request
 
06:43:33.288 --> 06:43:33.298 align:start position:0%
so so since it's so small and it's
 
06:43:34.730 --> 06:43:34.740 align:start position:0%
something that should have been budgeted
 
06:43:36.948 --> 06:43:36.958 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't we just have the department
 
06:43:41.570 --> 06:43:41.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:44.690 --> 06:43:44.700 align:start position:0%
this is a recent change so Das goes out
 
06:43:46.910 --> 06:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
to re-procure Statewide contracts on a
 
06:43:48.830 --> 06:43:48.840 align:start position:0%
regular basis one of the results of that
 
06:43:50.270 --> 06:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
just recently
 
06:43:51.650 --> 06:43:51.660 align:start position:0%
um so our agency budget was again
 
06:43:53.030 --> 06:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
submitted in August this is something
 
06:43:55.670 --> 06:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
that's been identified in the past month
 
06:43:57.770 --> 06:43:57.780 align:start position:0%
um as a result of that we do anticipate
 
06:44:01.788 --> 06:44:01.798 align:start position:0%
increased costs okay and then how about
 
06:44:04.610 --> 06:44:04.620 align:start position:0%
the last one I can't read the number 31
 
06:44:08.270 --> 06:44:08.280 align:start position:0%
30. 31 is 139 000 in general funds and
 
06:44:12.948 --> 06:44:12.958 align:start position:0%
24 and 145 025 for three additional
 
06:44:16.010 --> 06:44:16.020 align:start position:0%
facilities positions
 
06:44:19.970 --> 06:44:19.980 align:start position:0%
okay so we'll talk about that so so
 
06:44:19.980 --> 06:44:21.410 align:start position:0%
okay so we'll talk about that so so
I

06:44:21.410 --> 06:44:21.420 align:start position:0%
I
 
06:44:27.470 --> 06:44:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:31.910 --> 06:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
in these numbers I can't see 24 28 or
 
06:44:31.920 --> 06:44:33.170 align:start position:0%
in these numbers I can't see 24 28 or
30.

06:44:33.170 --> 06:44:33.180 align:start position:0%
30.
 
06:44:36.230 --> 06:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
I I don't see those as controversial
 
06:44:41.890 --> 06:44:41.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:45.410 --> 06:44:45.420 align:start position:0%
8 or 30.
 
06:44:47.270 --> 06:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
because if there's no opposition I'd
 
06:44:49.128 --> 06:44:49.138 align:start position:0%
like to just do a straw vote to accept
 
06:44:59.690 --> 06:44:59.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:59.700 --> 06:45:01.970 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:45:01.970 --> 06:45:01.980 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:45:05.448 --> 06:45:05.458 align:start position:0%
so so we're really only voting on 24 and
 
06:45:05.458 --> 06:45:07.430 align:start position:0%
so so we're really only voting on 24 and
30.

06:45:07.430 --> 06:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
30.
 
06:45:11.690 --> 06:45:11.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:16.070 --> 06:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:18.708 --> 06:45:18.718 align:start position:0%
all right one at a time though so so
 
06:45:22.368 --> 06:45:22.378 align:start position:0%
okay are we on 24 and 30 any opposition
 
06:45:24.110 --> 06:45:24.120 align:start position:0%
if you're in favor of both of those
 
06:45:26.390 --> 06:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
raise your hand
 
06:45:31.788 --> 06:45:31.798 align:start position:0%
okay now uh let's go sequentially we've
 
06:45:33.110 --> 06:45:33.120 align:start position:0%
got we're going to hold on Family
 
06:45:33.120 --> 06:45:35.270 align:start position:0%
got we're going to hold on Family
Planning

06:45:35.270 --> 06:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
Planning
 
06:45:38.810 --> 06:45:38.820 align:start position:0%
we're gonna hold on the pdab
 
06:45:41.570 --> 06:45:41.580 align:start position:0%
we're going to
 
06:45:43.788 --> 06:45:43.798 align:start position:0%
um on the dcyf Staffing we're going to
 
06:45:43.798 --> 06:45:45.190 align:start position:0%
um on the dcyf Staffing we're going to
hold

06:45:45.190 --> 06:45:45.200 align:start position:0%
hold
 
06:45:47.150 --> 06:45:47.160 align:start position:0%
on the
 
06:45:50.690 --> 06:45:50.700 align:start position:0%
facilities patients support this is the
 
06:45:54.590 --> 06:45:54.600 align:start position:0%
PPE we're there now so you have an issue
 
06:45:56.270 --> 06:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
what what what what is your concern
 
06:46:01.128 --> 06:46:01.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:01.138 --> 06:46:02.628 align:start position:0%
 
so

06:46:02.628 --> 06:46:02.638 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:46:05.208 --> 06:46:05.218 align:start position:0%
the quote Nathan right this is the new
 
06:46:06.890 --> 06:46:06.900 align:start position:0%
normal but I also understand that
 
06:46:09.170 --> 06:46:09.180 align:start position:0%
there's some science behind it and
 
06:46:10.970 --> 06:46:10.980 align:start position:0%
hospitals were using gloves a long time
 
06:46:13.610 --> 06:46:13.620 align:start position:0%
ago and continue to use and at some
 
06:46:15.110 --> 06:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
level masks have been used in certain
 
06:46:17.150 --> 06:46:17.160 align:start position:0%
places consistently but now we're we're
 
06:46:19.548 --> 06:46:19.558 align:start position:0%
we're changing what is typically
 
06:46:22.368 --> 06:46:22.378 align:start position:0%
personal protective equipment and
 
06:46:24.530 --> 06:46:24.540 align:start position:0%
spending money and I would
 
06:46:27.110 --> 06:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
I would vote against that one
 
06:46:29.330 --> 06:46:29.340 align:start position:0%
is there a condition under which you
 
06:46:32.448 --> 06:46:32.458 align:start position:0%
would support it is there a question you
 
06:46:34.430 --> 06:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
would ask is there anything you would
 
06:46:36.530 --> 06:46:36.540 align:start position:0%
need to have you believe that this is a
 
06:46:39.410 --> 06:46:39.420 align:start position:0%
good line the justification to change
 
06:46:42.650 --> 06:46:42.660 align:start position:0%
how standard equipment viruses have been
 
06:46:44.330 --> 06:46:44.340 align:start position:0%
around for a long time bacteria has been
 
06:46:45.650 --> 06:46:45.660 align:start position:0%
around for a long time we've been
 
06:46:48.468 --> 06:46:48.478 align:start position:0%
practicing standard PPE procedures for
 
06:46:51.170 --> 06:46:51.180 align:start position:0%
for a very long time we're now at the
 
06:46:54.468 --> 06:46:54.478 align:start position:0%
point where it's minor changes to like
 
06:46:57.230 --> 06:46:57.240 align:start position:0%
incoming staff potentially in the
 
06:46:58.850 --> 06:46:58.860 align:start position:0%
waiting room side of the things as
 
06:47:00.590 --> 06:47:00.600 align:start position:0%
opposed to the direct care so I'm just
 
06:47:02.030 --> 06:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
not convinced but if there's science
 
06:47:03.830 --> 06:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
that supports it I would I would gladly
 
06:47:05.570 --> 06:47:05.580 align:start position:0%
take a look at it I'm willing to vote no
 
06:47:08.330 --> 06:47:08.340 align:start position:0%
and be in the minority all right all
 
06:47:08.340 --> 06:47:09.170 align:start position:0%
and be in the minority all right all
right

06:47:09.170 --> 06:47:09.180 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:47:12.128 --> 06:47:12.138 align:start position:0%
you know because I'm not a virologist
 
06:47:15.110 --> 06:47:15.120 align:start position:0%
and and training infectious disease I'm
 
06:47:17.090 --> 06:47:17.100 align:start position:0%
going to trust the Health Care system to
 
06:47:18.770 --> 06:47:18.780 align:start position:0%
figure out what how they should dress
 
06:47:20.570 --> 06:47:20.580 align:start position:0%
when they're going into a contaminated
 
06:47:23.150 --> 06:47:23.160 align:start position:0%
area my instinct says they're over
 
06:47:26.510 --> 06:47:26.520 align:start position:0%
dressing but that's their decision so I
 
06:47:30.230 --> 06:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
I am I am okay with this line item is
 
06:47:32.090 --> 06:47:32.100 align:start position:0%
there any opposition to this line item
 
06:47:33.590 --> 06:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
other than representative hole
 
06:47:35.030 --> 06:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
representative burf do you have a
 
06:47:35.040 --> 06:47:36.230 align:start position:0%
representative burf do you have a
question

06:47:36.230 --> 06:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:47:39.948 --> 06:47:39.958 align:start position:0%
or your post okay all right so raise
 
06:47:41.270 --> 06:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
your hand do you have the co-head
 
06:47:43.070 --> 06:47:43.080 align:start position:0%
representative point I mean I don't
 
06:47:45.010 --> 06:47:45.020 align:start position:0%
understand whether this is just because
 
06:47:48.230 --> 06:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
ppe's gotten more expensive than than
 
06:47:49.968 --> 06:47:49.978 align:start position:0%
they expected or whether they're using
 
06:47:53.650 --> 06:47:53.660 align:start position:0%
it more often and um it does seem to be
 
06:47:57.590 --> 06:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
a pretty common line item for for most
 
06:48:00.650 --> 06:48:00.660 align:start position:0%
Hospital facilities so you you lean a
 
06:48:03.048 --> 06:48:03.058 align:start position:0%
post until you get a little more I'll
 
06:48:04.850 --> 06:48:04.860 align:start position:0%
support it they need I kind of lean a
 
06:48:08.690 --> 06:48:08.700 align:start position:0%
pose too so what what ask ask Mr White a
 
06:48:13.070 --> 06:48:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:13.080 --> 06:48:16.010 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:48:16.010 --> 06:48:16.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:19.610 --> 06:48:19.620 align:start position:0%
uh so is there any uh information about
 
06:48:21.830 --> 06:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
you know why why they're spending more
 
06:48:23.868 --> 06:48:23.878 align:start position:0%
on PPE are they using it in more places
 
06:48:27.530 --> 06:48:27.540 align:start position:0%
or just a matter of of of uh and you
 
06:48:29.030 --> 06:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
know I see the see the item they've
 
06:48:31.310 --> 06:48:31.320 align:start position:0%
gotten some support before but if you
 
06:48:34.368 --> 06:48:34.378 align:start position:0%
compare it to four years ago uh is it a
 
06:48:37.010 --> 06:48:37.020 align:start position:0%
dramatic difference in utilization or is
 
06:48:39.350 --> 06:48:39.360 align:start position:0%
it just costlier now
 
06:48:41.510 --> 06:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
um it's it's an increase in utilization
 
06:48:45.110 --> 06:48:45.120 align:start position:0%
based based on Health Care standards
 
06:48:48.230 --> 06:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
um four years ago you know if if there
 
06:48:51.708 --> 06:48:51.718 align:start position:0%
was uh there wasn't a and and acute and
 
06:48:53.930 --> 06:48:53.940 align:start position:0%
you know disease that that could shut
 
06:48:55.490 --> 06:48:55.500 align:start position:0%
down a whole wing and that happens today
 
06:48:57.948 --> 06:48:57.958 align:start position:0%
so if there's certain protocol that they
 
06:48:59.330 --> 06:48:59.340 align:start position:0%
have to follow
 
06:49:01.250 --> 06:49:01.260 align:start position:0%
um this helps prevent those kind of
 
06:49:02.690 --> 06:49:02.700 align:start position:0%
outbreaks because if they have to close
 
06:49:06.110 --> 06:49:06.120 align:start position:0%
down a section or a wing of the of the
 
06:49:08.628 --> 06:49:08.638 align:start position:0%
hospital because 11 12 15 staff are out
 
06:49:11.448 --> 06:49:11.458 align:start position:0%
that have all tested positive for covid
 
06:49:14.150 --> 06:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
um then you know it's it's essentially
 
06:49:16.850 --> 06:49:16.860 align:start position:0%
The New Normal and and right now
 
06:49:18.948 --> 06:49:18.958 align:start position:0%
um we're projecting again about 287
 
06:49:22.190 --> 06:49:22.200 align:start position:0%
million 287 thousand dollars in PPE
 
06:49:24.830 --> 06:49:24.840 align:start position:0%
costs for this state fiscal year so this
 
06:49:26.810 --> 06:49:26.820 align:start position:0%
this request isn't even sufficient to
 
06:49:28.070 --> 06:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
cover that
 
06:49:29.510 --> 06:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
um we're just requesting that a portion
 
06:49:30.468 --> 06:49:30.478 align:start position:0%
of that
 
06:49:32.510 --> 06:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
um anticipated cost in the future year
 
06:49:33.650 --> 06:49:33.660 align:start position:0%
be covered
 
06:49:35.990 --> 06:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
so what was your PPE budget four years
 
06:49:36.000 --> 06:49:37.368 align:start position:0%
so what was your PPE budget four years
ago

06:49:37.368 --> 06:49:37.378 align:start position:0%
ago
 
06:49:40.250 --> 06:49:40.260 align:start position:0%
it was not this I I can I can certainly
 
06:49:41.810 --> 06:49:41.820 align:start position:0%
get that I think the amount of the
 
06:49:43.730 --> 06:49:43.740 align:start position:0%
amount that they spent on PPE was
 
06:49:47.770 --> 06:49:47.780 align:start position:0%
nowhere near what we spend on today
 
06:49:51.410 --> 06:49:51.420 align:start position:0%
okay so so my observation is in fact
 
06:49:53.390 --> 06:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
four years ago we did have viral
 
06:49:55.250 --> 06:49:55.260 align:start position:0%
diseases and we did have Infectious
 
06:49:57.530 --> 06:49:57.540 align:start position:0%
Disease Control and we had preventative
 
06:50:01.610 --> 06:50:01.620 align:start position:0%
measures but that this pandemic has
 
06:50:05.990 --> 06:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
caused us to escalate our posture and so
 
06:50:08.750 --> 06:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
like I said I'm I'm in no position to
 
06:50:10.968 --> 06:50:10.978 align:start position:0%
review what they've done to increase the
 
06:50:14.030 --> 06:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
posture but it it would just be nice
 
06:50:16.430 --> 06:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
given the revelations about the lack of
 
06:50:19.250 --> 06:50:19.260 align:start position:0%
science around masks that somebody has
 
06:50:21.048 --> 06:50:21.058 align:start position:0%
actually done
 
06:50:23.690 --> 06:50:23.700 align:start position:0%
some science here and come to a good
 
06:50:26.570 --> 06:50:26.580 align:start position:0%
conclusion for utilization I know that
 
06:50:29.090 --> 06:50:29.100 align:start position:0%
when people walk into a hospital they're
 
06:50:31.430 --> 06:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
handed a mask which is ridiculous
 
06:50:33.170 --> 06:50:33.180 align:start position:0%
because we know that the Mask doesn't
 
06:50:37.868 --> 06:50:37.878 align:start position:0%
actually do anything it's it it so
 
06:50:40.250 --> 06:50:40.260 align:start position:0%
but I don't want to I'm not ready to
 
06:50:42.048 --> 06:50:42.058 align:start position:0%
fight that fight this time around it's
 
06:50:44.030 --> 06:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
just it's just stupid and it's something
 
06:50:47.390 --> 06:50:47.400 align:start position:0%
that's happening and I I I'm I'm still
 
06:50:49.788 --> 06:50:49.798 align:start position:0%
in favor of just voting for this do you
 
06:50:52.368 --> 06:50:52.378 align:start position:0%
want to wait till Monday to to vote no
 
06:50:54.830 --> 06:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
no I'm okay voting now
 
06:50:58.010 --> 06:50:58.020 align:start position:0%
okay I
 
06:51:00.650 --> 06:51:00.660 align:start position:0%
you'd like to vote okay if you're in
 
06:51:03.288 --> 06:51:03.298 align:start position:0%
favor of this 150 000 line item raise
 
06:51:05.390 --> 06:51:05.400 align:start position:0%
your hand
 
06:51:08.868 --> 06:51:08.878 align:start position:0%
if you're opposed to representative hole
 
06:51:12.410 --> 06:51:12.420 align:start position:0%
okay that's good this is what keeps us
 
06:51:15.770 --> 06:51:15.780 align:start position:0%
this strength from the Pollard Bureau
 
06:51:15.780 --> 06:51:16.850 align:start position:0%
this strength from the Pollard Bureau
um

06:51:16.850 --> 06:51:16.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:51:21.350 --> 06:51:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:22.910 --> 06:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
so we're on
 
06:51:25.490 --> 06:51:25.500 align:start position:0%
Hampstead Hospital operations I wanted
 
06:51:28.030 --> 06:51:28.040 align:start position:0%
to defer this because I imagine
 
06:51:30.650 --> 06:51:30.660 align:start position:0%
representative hole and others may have
 
06:51:33.230 --> 06:51:33.240 align:start position:0%
a lot of questions about converting
 
06:51:37.070 --> 06:51:37.080 align:start position:0%
temporary people to permanent
 
06:51:39.530 --> 06:51:39.540 align:start position:0%
do do you want to articulate your own
 
06:51:39.540 --> 06:51:43.310 align:start position:0%
do do you want to articulate your own
question

06:51:43.310 --> 06:51:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:44.868 --> 06:51:44.878 align:start position:0%
I understand correctly from the
 
06:51:46.910 --> 06:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
testimony earlier right this is we took
 
06:51:49.070 --> 06:51:49.080 align:start position:0%
over the hospital these positions were
 
06:51:51.590 --> 06:51:51.600 align:start position:0%
partially funded for a part of a year
 
06:51:54.288 --> 06:51:54.298 align:start position:0%
and now we are making them full-time
 
06:51:56.468 --> 06:51:56.478 align:start position:0%
employees if I
 
06:52:00.230 --> 06:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
so the the process by which we typically
 
06:52:03.170 --> 06:52:03.180 align:start position:0%
create full-time authorized positions
 
06:52:07.128 --> 06:52:07.138 align:start position:0%
happens actually in February of 2022 we
 
06:52:08.510 --> 06:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
submit those to the governor's office
 
06:52:10.250 --> 06:52:10.260 align:start position:0%
those are input into the budget system
 
06:52:12.350 --> 06:52:12.360 align:start position:0%
and then those would come through as the
 
06:52:14.390 --> 06:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
full-time authorized positions because
 
06:52:16.730 --> 06:52:16.740 align:start position:0%
we purchased the hospital outside of the
 
06:52:19.430 --> 06:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
standard budget process we use dop
 
06:52:21.770 --> 06:52:21.780 align:start position:0%
Personnel rules to establish these
 
06:52:24.230 --> 06:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
full-time temporary positions uh just
 
06:52:26.448 --> 06:52:26.458 align:start position:0%
because we were in the off season this
 
06:52:28.250 --> 06:52:28.260 align:start position:0%
would convert them to reflect the fact
 
06:52:31.850 --> 06:52:31.860 align:start position:0%
that they are now critical features of
 
06:52:33.770 --> 06:52:33.780 align:start position:0%
Hampstead Hospital they they are their
 
06:52:36.530 --> 06:52:36.540 align:start position:0%
full-time employees normally when we
 
06:52:38.868 --> 06:52:38.878 align:start position:0%
have full-time temporary employees it's
 
06:52:41.030 --> 06:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
because there's a five-year Grant or
 
06:52:42.830 --> 06:52:42.840 align:start position:0%
some kind of temporary funding source
 
06:52:46.010 --> 06:52:46.020 align:start position:0%
this is an instance where for all
 
06:52:47.390 --> 06:52:47.400 align:start position:0%
intents and purposes we would expect
 
06:52:49.430 --> 06:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
that these positions would be here 10
 
06:52:51.048 --> 06:52:51.058 align:start position:0%
years from now
 
06:52:54.530 --> 06:52:54.540 align:start position:0%
follow-up um as long as I'm assuming
 
06:52:55.788 --> 06:52:55.798 align:start position:0%
this to be true the salaries are
 
06:52:57.650 --> 06:52:57.660 align:start position:0%
consistent with what they're hired at in
 
06:53:00.468 --> 06:53:00.478 align:start position:0%
terms of the conversion I don't have any
 
06:53:04.670 --> 06:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:07.310 --> 06:53:07.320 align:start position:0%
okay is there any uh opposition to this
 
06:53:08.410 --> 06:53:08.420 align:start position:0%
line item
 
06:53:12.350 --> 06:53:12.360 align:start position:0%
I'm not seeing any so raise your hand if
 
06:53:17.448 --> 06:53:17.458 align:start position:0%
you're in favor of item what is that 29
 
06:53:17.458 --> 06:53:20.150 align:start position:0%
you're in favor of item what is that 29
yeah

06:53:20.150 --> 06:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:21.890 --> 06:53:21.900 align:start position:0%
representative norger and I assume
 
06:53:23.270 --> 06:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
you're a yes
 
06:53:23.280 --> 06:53:24.708 align:start position:0%
you're a yes
okay

06:53:24.708 --> 06:53:24.718 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:53:27.468 --> 06:53:27.478 align:start position:0%
all right I hate those assumptions
 
06:53:31.490 --> 06:53:31.500 align:start position:0%
uh okay so that's okay uh 30
 
06:53:34.250 --> 06:53:34.260 align:start position:0%
uh we did right
 
06:53:38.510 --> 06:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
okay so then we're on 31.
 
06:53:40.610 --> 06:53:40.620 align:start position:0%
this is this is another kind of
 
06:53:42.650 --> 06:53:42.660 align:start position:0%
personnel related item do you want to
 
06:53:44.690 --> 06:53:44.700 align:start position:0%
just tell us again what you've already
 
06:53:46.250 --> 06:53:46.260 align:start position:0%
told us
 
06:53:49.670 --> 06:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
sure so um when commissioner Weaver came
 
06:53:52.310 --> 06:53:52.320 align:start position:0%
in to talk about facilities she talked a
 
06:53:54.530 --> 06:53:54.540 align:start position:0%
little bit about how in the um in this
 
06:53:57.830 --> 06:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
in the most recent uh hb1 chapter 91
 
06:54:02.570 --> 06:54:02.580 align:start position:0%
laws of 2021 uh a section of RSA was
 
06:54:05.330 --> 06:54:05.340 align:start position:0%
deleted that section of RSA required
 
06:54:06.468 --> 06:54:06.478 align:start position:0%
that the Department of Health and Human
 
06:54:08.930 --> 06:54:08.940 align:start position:0%
Services enter into an mou with the
 
06:54:11.390 --> 06:54:11.400 align:start position:0%
Department of administrative services to
 
06:54:14.090 --> 06:54:14.100 align:start position:0%
articulate what services would be
 
06:54:16.730 --> 06:54:16.740 align:start position:0%
provided to the department for its
 
06:54:19.270 --> 06:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
support of facilities
 
06:54:22.368 --> 06:54:22.378 align:start position:0%
after that provision was struck we we
 
06:54:25.250 --> 06:54:25.260 align:start position:0%
actually used to have about eight Das
 
06:54:26.990 --> 06:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
Personnel embedded within the Brown
 
06:54:29.270 --> 06:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
building within the main Department of
 
06:54:30.890 --> 06:54:30.900 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services building those
 
06:54:33.410 --> 06:54:33.420 align:start position:0%
positions have since left some of them
 
06:54:37.968 --> 06:54:37.978 align:start position:0%
have retired this request is to get
 
06:54:40.490 --> 06:54:40.500 align:start position:0%
positions to kind of fill that Gap in
 
06:54:43.090 --> 06:54:43.100 align:start position:0%
services so right now we don't even
 
06:54:46.250 --> 06:54:46.260 align:start position:0%
necessarily have staff to do desk moves
 
06:54:48.170 --> 06:54:48.180 align:start position:0%
something simple like that or set up a
 
06:54:48.180 --> 06:54:49.368 align:start position:0%
something simple like that or set up a
cubicle

06:54:49.368 --> 06:54:49.378 align:start position:0%
cubicle
 
06:54:50.810 --> 06:54:50.820 align:start position:0%
um you know that's right now our
 
06:54:52.310 --> 06:54:52.320 align:start position:0%
director is actually having to go out of
 
06:54:54.650 --> 06:54:54.660 align:start position:0%
her way to do that kind of work we also
 
06:54:56.690 --> 06:54:56.700 align:start position:0%
lost our position
 
06:54:59.208 --> 06:54:59.218 align:start position:0%
um a position that previously wrote and
 
06:55:02.448 --> 06:55:02.458 align:start position:0%
managed all of our lease agreements for
 
06:55:04.548 --> 06:55:04.558 align:start position:0%
the Department this request is is
 
06:55:06.048 --> 06:55:06.058 align:start position:0%
seeking that administrator position
 
06:55:08.330 --> 06:55:08.340 align:start position:0%
would would fill that responsibility
 
06:55:10.128 --> 06:55:10.138 align:start position:0%
that was previously filled through that
 
06:55:12.048 --> 06:55:12.058 align:start position:0%
mou with the Department of
 
06:55:15.708 --> 06:55:15.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:19.968 --> 06:55:19.978 align:start position:0%
is there anyone opposed to line 31
 
06:55:23.510 --> 06:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
not seeing anyone let's do estravo if
 
06:55:25.968 --> 06:55:25.978 align:start position:0%
you're in favor you'll raise your hand
 
06:55:29.810 --> 06:55:29.820 align:start position:0%
all right it passes so I think we've
 
06:55:32.628 --> 06:55:32.638 align:start position:0%
gone all the way through the sheet do
 
06:55:35.448 --> 06:55:35.458 align:start position:0%
you have anything else for us I'm
 
06:55:38.510 --> 06:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
wondering if the division is able to
 
06:55:40.788 --> 06:55:40.798 align:start position:0%
vote on the other components of the
 
06:55:43.190 --> 06:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
alcohol fund changes that I handed out
 
06:55:44.690 --> 06:55:44.700 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
06:55:44.700 --> 06:55:48.310 align:start position:0%
this morning
or

06:55:48.310 --> 06:55:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:51.350 --> 06:55:51.360 align:start position:0%
I'll it feel it felt to me
 
06:55:52.910 --> 06:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
representative Waller that on the
 
06:55:55.510 --> 06:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
Alcohol fund that you guys wanted to
 
06:55:59.090 --> 06:55:59.100 align:start position:0%
absorb the changes and
 
06:56:02.628 --> 06:56:02.638 align:start position:0%
discuss the changes and wait till Monday
 
06:56:05.990 --> 06:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
or do you think you might be ready to
 
06:56:08.150 --> 06:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
vote on
 
06:56:10.128 --> 06:56:10.138 align:start position:0%
it is Friday night it's a good time to
 
06:56:19.310 --> 06:56:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:21.230 --> 06:56:21.240 align:start position:0%
we'll just leave it till Monday at this
 
06:56:24.968 --> 06:56:24.978 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:27.350 --> 06:56:27.360 align:start position:0%
you're winning
 
06:56:27.360 --> 06:56:33.770 align:start position:0%
you're winning
foreign

06:56:33.770 --> 06:56:33.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:36.410 --> 06:56:36.420 align:start position:0%
all right we're in adjournment uh
 
06:56:40.310 --> 06:56:40.320 align:start position:0%
no so so let's just wait okay anything
 
06:56:43.070 --> 06:56:43.080 align:start position:0%
else in that case I have nothing else so
 
06:56:45.230 --> 06:56:45.240 align:start position:0%
on Monday I'll come back with a list of
 
06:56:46.788 --> 06:56:46.798 align:start position:0%
everything you've done an updated list
 
06:56:48.948 --> 06:56:48.958 align:start position:0%
of House Bill 2 and I think we'll also
 
06:56:50.750 --> 06:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
go through
 
06:56:52.070 --> 06:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
um either Monday morning or Monday
 
06:56:52.080 --> 06:56:53.530 align:start position:0%
um either Monday morning or Monday
afternoon

06:56:53.530 --> 06:56:53.540 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
06:56:55.788 --> 06:56:55.798 align:start position:0%
after the full committee is done with
 
06:56:57.708 --> 06:56:57.718 align:start position:0%
its exact session uh we can go through
 
06:56:59.868 --> 06:56:59.878 align:start position:0%
all of the HHS divisions and make sure
 
06:57:01.250 --> 06:57:01.260 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that people want to talk
 
06:57:04.910 --> 06:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
about that's been left out okay so last
 
06:57:08.868 --> 06:57:08.878 align:start position:0%
year or two years ago it seemed to me
 
06:57:12.410 --> 06:57:12.420 align:start position:0%
like there were some major categories at
 
06:57:16.010 --> 06:57:16.020 align:start position:0%
the hb1 level like Glen Cliff Veterans
 
06:57:20.090 --> 06:57:20.100 align:start position:0%
Home New Hampshire hospital and we just
 
06:57:22.670 --> 06:57:22.680 align:start position:0%
did like a blanket vote on those so
 
06:57:24.288 --> 06:57:24.298 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll accept the governor's
 
06:57:24.298 --> 06:57:25.968 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll accept the governor's
proposal

06:57:25.968 --> 06:57:25.978 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
06:57:32.830 --> 06:57:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:36.830 --> 06:57:36.840 align:start position:0%
two years ago but okay I I think that's
 
06:57:38.990 --> 06:57:39.000 align:start position:0%
that's the only way I remember so this
 
06:57:41.570 --> 06:57:41.580 align:start position:0%
you know since this is my only year they
 
06:57:43.548 --> 06:57:43.558 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
06:57:45.670 --> 06:57:45.680 align:start position:0%
so I would like to
 
06:57:50.628 --> 06:57:50.638 align:start position:0%
identify those major divisions where we
 
06:57:52.730 --> 06:57:52.740 align:start position:0%
don't that we already just agree that we
 
06:57:54.948 --> 06:57:54.958 align:start position:0%
don't need to get into the weed zone or
 
06:57:57.830 --> 06:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
or do you think you're going to want to
 
06:58:02.448 --> 06:58:02.458 align:start position:0%
go into hb1 and atoms and specifically
 
06:58:11.770 --> 06:58:11.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:15.170 --> 06:58:15.180 align:start position:0%
well I mean I think that
 
06:58:17.810 --> 06:58:17.820 align:start position:0%
here we are we've got
 
06:58:21.048 --> 06:58:21.058 align:start position:0%
what one and a half days left that we
 
06:58:22.128 --> 06:58:22.138 align:start position:0%
can do it
 
06:58:23.990 --> 06:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
I think we should have been doing that
 
06:58:24.000 --> 06:58:26.690 align:start position:0%
I think we should have been doing that
exercise

06:58:26.690 --> 06:58:26.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:28.788 --> 06:58:28.798 align:start position:0%
for the last month
 
06:58:30.410 --> 06:58:30.420 align:start position:0%
going through the divisions and looking
 
06:58:32.090 --> 06:58:32.100 align:start position:0%
at the budgets and deciding if we
 
06:58:33.948 --> 06:58:33.958 align:start position:0%
thought those I don't think there's time
 
06:58:36.770 --> 06:58:36.780 align:start position:0%
to do what you've just uh going through
 
06:58:39.890 --> 06:58:39.900 align:start position:0%
the budgets and trying to decide whether
 
06:58:42.230 --> 06:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
they're appropriate or not appropriate
 
06:58:44.990 --> 06:58:45.000 align:start position:0%
so here we are at the last minute
 
06:58:47.890 --> 06:58:47.900 align:start position:0%
yeah I think the best we can do is just
 
06:58:50.750 --> 06:58:50.760 align:start position:0%
vote vote for them up or down by
 
06:58:52.610 --> 06:58:52.620 align:start position:0%
divisions or by
 
06:58:55.910 --> 06:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
you know major organizational sir
 
06:58:57.170 --> 06:58:57.180 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney would you
 
06:58:59.448 --> 06:58:59.458 align:start position:0%
summarize for us all of the emails that
 
06:59:01.128 --> 06:59:01.138 align:start position:0%
you've received after every one of these
 
06:59:03.048 --> 06:59:03.058 align:start position:0%
briefing sessions where you've invited
 
06:59:05.868 --> 06:59:05.878 align:start position:0%
people to provide feedback on particular
 
06:59:08.090 --> 06:59:08.100 align:start position:0%
areas that we had heard that day
 
06:59:11.750 --> 06:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:15.948 --> 06:59:15.958 align:start position:0%
in terms of responses so just so the
 
06:59:18.170 --> 06:59:18.180 align:start position:0%
audience knows I've sent out emails to
 
06:59:20.448 --> 06:59:20.458 align:start position:0%
the division after each presentation
 
06:59:23.330 --> 06:59:23.340 align:start position:0%
asking for any input or feedback for
 
06:59:28.310 --> 06:59:28.320 align:start position:0%
house bill 2. and I have received some I
 
06:59:31.070 --> 06:59:31.080 align:start position:0%
recall from representative hole
 
06:59:35.150 --> 06:59:35.160 align:start position:0%
and representatives representative erf
 
06:59:37.270 --> 06:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge now there have been
 
06:59:40.190 --> 06:59:40.200 align:start position:0%
conversations related to the emails but
 
06:59:43.850 --> 06:59:43.860 align:start position:0%
in terms of responses those two
 
06:59:46.788 --> 06:59:46.798 align:start position:0%
come to mind as having responded you
 
06:59:49.610 --> 06:59:49.620 align:start position:0%
just limited it to hp2 but after every
 
06:59:51.468 --> 06:59:51.478 align:start position:0%
division people could have commented on
 
06:59:53.628 --> 06:59:53.638 align:start position:0%
hp1 as well could they not
 
06:59:53.638 --> 06:59:55.128 align:start position:0%
hp1 as well could they not
yes

06:59:55.128 --> 06:59:55.138 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:59:58.788 --> 06:59:58.798 align:start position:0%
okay so so given that we pay attention
 
07:00:00.830 --> 07:00:00.840 align:start position:0%
to those emails
 
07:00:02.930 --> 07:00:02.940 align:start position:0%
um like for example I need to ask you
 
07:00:06.230 --> 07:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
still represent Waller are we are do you
 
07:00:08.510 --> 07:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
still think we need represent or Mr
 
07:00:11.090 --> 07:00:11.100 align:start position:0%
Monahan to come in on Monday to
 
07:00:13.368 --> 07:00:13.378 align:start position:0%
specifically talk about his spreadsheet
 
07:00:20.030 --> 07:00:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:22.190 --> 07:00:22.200 align:start position:0%
well I think it would be would have been
 
07:00:23.930 --> 07:00:23.940 align:start position:0%
helpful to have had
 
07:00:26.208 --> 07:00:26.218 align:start position:0%
someone who could speak to that
 
07:00:29.208 --> 07:00:29.218 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet I mean anyone looking at it
 
07:00:31.310 --> 07:00:31.320 align:start position:0%
probably can think of a few questions
 
07:00:34.430 --> 07:00:34.440 align:start position:0%
they might ask about it
 
07:00:36.948 --> 07:00:36.958 align:start position:0%
um but like I said here we are at the
 
07:00:39.410 --> 07:00:39.420 align:start position:0%
last minute so
 
07:00:41.930 --> 07:00:41.940 align:start position:0%
um you know maybe maybe people want to
 
07:00:43.788 --> 07:00:43.798 align:start position:0%
move on without without that
 
07:00:47.150 --> 07:00:47.160 align:start position:0%
conversation uh I you know people wait
 
07:00:48.830 --> 07:00:48.840 align:start position:0%
to the last minute to say what they
 
07:00:50.570 --> 07:00:50.580 align:start position:0%
think then you can't do anything until
 
07:00:53.390 --> 07:00:53.400 align:start position:0%
the last minute so ever I think every
 
07:00:55.968 --> 07:00:55.978 align:start position:0%
response request I've gotten through
 
07:00:58.368 --> 07:00:58.378 align:start position:0%
email to representative Mooney I've
 
07:01:00.890 --> 07:01:00.900 align:start position:0%
factored into what we're doing so you
 
07:01:02.448 --> 07:01:02.458 align:start position:0%
know if there's been a delay I think
 
07:01:04.610 --> 07:01:04.620 align:start position:0%
it's been a shared responsibility on the
 
07:01:04.620 --> 07:01:05.628 align:start position:0%
it's been a shared responsibility on the
delay

07:01:05.628 --> 07:01:05.638 align:start position:0%
delay
 
07:01:05.638 --> 07:01:07.430 align:start position:0%
delay
so

07:01:07.430 --> 07:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:01:13.010 --> 07:01:13.020 align:start position:0%
um I I think Mr Monahan is in
 
07:01:15.230 --> 07:01:15.240 align:start position:0%
Puerto Rico
 
07:01:18.350 --> 07:01:18.360 align:start position:0%
right so he's not going to come up today
 
07:01:21.048 --> 07:01:21.058 align:start position:0%
to talk to us so so if these is he going
 
07:01:24.770 --> 07:01:24.780 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:28.368 --> 07:01:28.378 align:start position:0%
okay so let's ask him to stand by to
 
07:01:30.350 --> 07:01:30.360 align:start position:0%
come talk to us on Tuesday and we'll
 
07:01:33.110 --> 07:01:33.120 align:start position:0%
find out on Monday if we still need him
 
07:01:35.990 --> 07:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh is there anyone other than Mr Monahan
 
07:01:37.610 --> 07:01:37.620 align:start position:0%
who could speak to that spreadsheet
 
07:01:47.208 --> 07:01:47.218 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:49.788 --> 07:01:49.798 align:start position:0%
let's let's see if we can get Alex to
 
07:01:52.670 --> 07:01:52.680 align:start position:0%
come in on Monday and uh he can give it
 
07:01:55.670 --> 07:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:57.650 --> 07:01:57.660 align:start position:0%
okay are there any other requests on
 
07:01:59.750 --> 07:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
what we should do on Monday well I I was
 
07:02:01.910 --> 07:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
just going to say that um
 
07:02:04.190 --> 07:02:04.200 align:start position:0%
um that
 
07:02:07.788 --> 07:02:07.798 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Monahan was in in one way kind of
 
07:02:10.430 --> 07:02:10.440 align:start position:0%
a scribe in putting the whole document
 
07:02:13.850 --> 07:02:13.860 align:start position:0%
together so there were a team of
 
07:02:16.010 --> 07:02:16.020 align:start position:0%
requests some some we heard some
 
07:02:18.830 --> 07:02:18.840 align:start position:0%
comments on today from the New Hampshire
 
07:02:21.070 --> 07:02:21.080 align:start position:0%
Hospital Association
 
07:02:23.690 --> 07:02:23.700 align:start position:0%
but there was a large group of people
 
07:02:27.170 --> 07:02:27.180 align:start position:0%
involved I think Tuesday I sent out a
 
07:02:29.570 --> 07:02:29.580 align:start position:0%
series of questions
 
07:02:32.208 --> 07:02:32.218 align:start position:0%
um back to try to get some clarification
 
07:02:34.968 --> 07:02:34.978 align:start position:0%
on the rationale and some of those
 
07:02:37.070 --> 07:02:37.080 align:start position:0%
things I've gotten some feedback which
 
07:02:39.410 --> 07:02:39.420 align:start position:0%
anything I've talked about today was
 
07:02:42.288 --> 07:02:42.298 align:start position:0%
based you know included that but I I'm
 
07:02:44.750 --> 07:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
hoping to get more and I I even got
 
07:02:46.968 --> 07:02:46.978 align:start position:0%
indications that I would get some more
 
07:02:50.090 --> 07:02:50.100 align:start position:0%
feedback today so
 
07:02:50.100 --> 07:02:50.690 align:start position:0%
feedback today so
um

07:02:50.690 --> 07:02:50.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:02:50.700 --> 07:02:52.670 align:start position:0%
um
uh

07:02:52.670 --> 07:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:02:55.610 --> 07:02:55.620 align:start position:0%
you know if we had three weeks then we'd
 
07:02:57.350 --> 07:02:57.360 align:start position:0%
be that much better but I'm sure it
 
07:02:58.730 --> 07:02:58.740 align:start position:0%
comes down to this kind of deadline
 
07:03:01.010 --> 07:03:01.020 align:start position:0%
every time this isn't part of the normal
 
07:03:03.830 --> 07:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
process and we'll do the best we can
 
07:03:06.350 --> 07:03:06.360 align:start position:0%
with the information that we have and
 
07:03:08.150 --> 07:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
the timetable
 
07:03:09.770 --> 07:03:09.780 align:start position:0%
um you know that will follow under your
 
07:03:09.780 --> 07:03:12.350 align:start position:0%
um you know that will follow under your
leadership

07:03:12.350 --> 07:03:12.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:12.360 --> 07:03:14.208 align:start position:0%
 
okay

07:03:14.208 --> 07:03:14.218 align:start position:0%
okay
 
07:03:18.350 --> 07:03:18.360 align:start position:0%
um any parting comments representative
 
07:03:20.690 --> 07:03:20.700 align:start position:0%
to make you aware that I have an
 
07:03:23.150 --> 07:03:23.160 align:start position:0%
amendment for a very small amount that
 
07:03:25.250 --> 07:03:25.260 align:start position:0%
we can I guess discuss on Monday is that
 
07:03:27.350 --> 07:03:27.360 align:start position:0%
the Middle School thing
 
07:03:27.360 --> 07:03:28.490 align:start position:0%
the Middle School thing
okay

07:03:28.490 --> 07:03:28.500 align:start position:0%
okay
 
07:03:31.548 --> 07:03:31.558 align:start position:0%
all right and rep Mr Ripple is aware of
 
07:03:35.270 --> 07:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
it Mr Ripple's already drafted okay very
 
07:03:35.280 --> 07:03:36.410 align:start position:0%
it Mr Ripple's already drafted okay very
good

07:03:36.410 --> 07:03:36.420 align:start position:0%
good
 
07:03:38.990 --> 07:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
07:03:39.000 --> 07:03:40.368 align:start position:0%
anything else
okay

07:03:40.368 --> 07:03:40.378 align:start position:0%
okay
 
07:03:44.690 --> 07:03:44.700 align:start position:0%
