number of bills uh that we're going to
 
00:10:38.389 --> 00:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
be holding hearings on today we had a
 
00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:41.100 align:start position:0%
full day of hearings yesterday in which
 
00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:43.140 align:start position:0%
we had a great number of witnesses
 
00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:45.540 align:start position:0%
testified with various views on the
 
00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:46.910 align:start position:0%
testified with various views on the
issues

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:50.100 align:start position:0%
um before us many of which are similar
 
00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:52.760 align:start position:0%
or the same as the issues on bills today
 
00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
it was a very although people had strong
 
00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:57.720 align:start position:0%
disagreements it was a very respectful
 
00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:01.100 align:start position:0%
and informative uh uh exercise
 
00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:03.240 align:start position:0%
throughout the day and although it was a
 
00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
long day it was very informative and I
 
00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:08.120 align:start position:0%
would ask police that we have the same
 
00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:10.740 align:start position:0%
manner of proceeding today that is in
 
00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:12.300 align:start position:0%
people we understand that people have
 
00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
different views and we expect you to
 
00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:17.640 align:start position:0%
express them and express them uh
 
00:11:20.389 --> 00:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
um vigorously but we also expect that it
 
00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:22.620 align:start position:0%
will be conducted in in a respectful
 
00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:25.380 align:start position:0%
manner so with that
 
00:11:27.769 --> 00:11:27.779 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to first uh
 
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
turn to uh House Bill 346 FN and I'm
 
00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
going to recognize representative Glenn
 
00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
cordelli the prime sponsor of the bill
 
00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:39.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and honorable
 
00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:42.300 align:start position:0%
colleagues off the Record Glenn cordelli
 
00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:45.180 align:start position:0%
representing Tuftonboro Wolfeboro and
 
00:11:47.569 --> 00:11:47.579 align:start position:0%
Ossipee in the beautiful Lakes Region
 
00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:49.980 align:start position:0%
usually I would be here at another
 
00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:52.140 align:start position:0%
committee talking about the education of
 
00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:55.260 align:start position:0%
children but today I take a step back to
 
00:11:57.530 --> 00:11:57.540 align:start position:0%
talk about the lives of children
 
00:11:59.630 --> 00:11:59.640 align:start position:0%
this is a very simple Bill a very simple
 
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
concept that a baby born alive should
 
00:12:05.329 --> 00:12:05.339 align:start position:0%
have medical attention even if they are
 
00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:07.320 align:start position:0%
born alive as the result of a failed
 
00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:08.509 align:start position:0%
born alive as the result of a failed
abortion

00:12:08.509 --> 00:12:08.519 align:start position:0%
abortion
 
00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
does a woman's right to choose an
 
00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:13.140 align:start position:0%
abortion extend to a point beyond that
 
00:12:14.389 --> 00:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
of birth
 
00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
what about a baby born alive as the
 
00:12:18.889 --> 00:12:18.899 align:start position:0%
result of a failed abortion
 
00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:21.240 align:start position:0%
once that child is born and is separated
 
00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
from the mother
 
00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
is that child protected by the
 
00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.150 align:start position:0%
is that child protected by the
Constitution

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
Constitution
 
00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
in California we have seen a law passed
 
00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
recently that provides that no person
 
00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:35.640 align:start position:0%
shall be subject to civil civil or
 
00:12:37.269 --> 00:12:37.279 align:start position:0%
criminal penalties
 
00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
for an alleged pregnancy outcome
 
00:12:42.949 --> 00:12:42.959 align:start position:0%
including miscarriage still birth
 
00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
abortion or perinatal death
 
00:12:48.769 --> 00:12:48.779 align:start position:0%
perinatal is defined by the national
 
00:12:51.889 --> 00:12:51.899 align:start position:0%
Center of health statistics as the
 
00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:55.260 align:start position:0%
period between 28 weeks of gestation and
 
00:12:57.889 --> 00:12:57.899 align:start position:0%
seven days after birth
 
00:12:57.899 --> 00:13:00.290 align:start position:0%
seven days after birth
perinatal

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:00.300 align:start position:0%
perinatal
 
00:13:02.449 --> 00:13:02.459 align:start position:0%
the argument is that this doesn't happen
 
00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:04.500 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire but how do we know
 
00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
we don't capture any statistics
 
00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:10.380 align:start position:0%
the abortion survivors Network says that
 
00:13:13.449 --> 00:13:13.459 align:start position:0%
only 10 states states keep track of
 
00:13:15.889 --> 00:13:15.899 align:start position:0%
abortion statistics
 
00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:19.620 align:start position:0%
we saw in 1981 in a medical excuse me in
 
00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
a Philadelphia Inquirer article that the
 
00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
survival of a baby after abortion was
 
00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:28.740 align:start position:0%
referred to as a dreaded complication
 
00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
in that article it quoted Doctor Who was
 
00:13:33.829 --> 00:13:33.839 align:start position:0%
then director of abortion surveillance
 
00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:36.959 align:start position:0%
for the CDC as estimating that between
 
00:13:41.329 --> 00:13:41.339 align:start position:0%
400 to 500 abortion live births occurred
 
00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
each year in the United States
 
00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:45.660 align:start position:0%
and according to the family research
 
00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:48.660 align:start position:0%
Council we are one of 12 states with no
 
00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
protection for children born alive as a
 
00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
result of an abortion I just want to
 
00:13:56.629 --> 00:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
take a moment um I I don't know if you
 
00:13:58.610 --> 00:13:58.620 align:start position:0%
each have a copy of a highlighted
 
00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:00.540 align:start position:0%
version of the bill but I just wanted to
 
00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:03.320 align:start position:0%
point out several key things in that
 
00:14:05.569 --> 00:14:05.579 align:start position:0%
highlighted version to you
 
00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:08.940 align:start position:0%
on the first page on line 13 we have the
 
00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
definition of born alive
 
00:14:16.129 --> 00:14:16.139 align:start position:0%
uh on line 26 we Define reproductive
 
00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
Health Care Facility
 
00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:20.820 align:start position:0%
in statute that means a place other than
 
00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:22.860 align:start position:0%
within or on the grounds of a hospital
 
00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:27.660 align:start position:0%
where abortions are offered or performed
 
00:14:30.829 --> 00:14:30.839 align:start position:0%
then on line 28
 
00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
a section related to the protection of
 
00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:37.129 align:start position:0%
a section related to the protection of
children

00:14:37.129 --> 00:14:37.139 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:40.440 align:start position:0%
and most importantly
 
00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
on the second page lines 8 through 12.
 
00:14:47.269 --> 00:14:47.279 align:start position:0%
this is where the criminal penalties are
 
00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:50.360 align:start position:0%
defined there would be a penalty only
 
00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:54.540 align:start position:0%
only if a health care provider withholds
 
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:56.160 align:start position:0%
medical treatment
 
00:14:59.090 --> 00:14:59.100 align:start position:0%
and performs an overt act with the
 
00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
intention intention of causing or
 
00:15:03.949 --> 00:15:03.959 align:start position:0%
hastening the death of an unborn child
 
00:15:07.009 --> 00:15:07.019 align:start position:0%
that is the only case the only time
 
00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
where there would be penalties against
 
00:15:11.269 --> 00:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
the health care provider we've heard
 
00:15:14.689 --> 00:15:14.699 align:start position:0%
stories in the past about
 
00:15:14.699 --> 00:15:15.410 align:start position:0%
stories in the past about
um

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:15.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:19.129 --> 00:15:19.139 align:start position:0%
Health Care Providers being charged if
 
00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:22.940 align:start position:0%
there is a fatal
 
00:15:26.689 --> 00:15:26.699 align:start position:0%
abnormally with the the baby and the
 
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:30.240 align:start position:0%
baby cannot be resuscitated or is going
 
00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:33.420 align:start position:0%
to die and wouldn't it be more Humane to
 
00:15:35.509 --> 00:15:35.519 align:start position:0%
let the baby remain with the mother for
 
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
whatever time that baby has
 
00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:38.990 align:start position:0%
whatever time that baby has
yes

00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:42.060 align:start position:0%
yes and the doctor in that case is not
 
00:15:44.569 --> 00:15:44.579 align:start position:0%
withholding or causing or hastening the
 
00:15:46.189 --> 00:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
death of a child
 
00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:49.740 align:start position:0%
so that argument does not hold with this
 
00:15:53.329 --> 00:15:53.339 align:start position:0%
bill that is before you so I ask you
 
00:15:55.189 --> 00:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
um that
 
00:15:57.410 --> 00:15:57.420 align:start position:0%
the question today
 
00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:01.800 align:start position:0%
for all of us is whether we value the
 
00:16:05.269 --> 00:16:05.279 align:start position:0%
lives of children born alive
 
00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:06.959 align:start position:0%
whether they have constitutional
 
00:16:06.959 --> 00:16:08.150 align:start position:0%
whether they have constitutional
protections

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
protections
 
00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:10.260 align:start position:0%

just to give you a little bit of
 
00:16:58.069 --> 00:16:58.079 align:start position:0%
background I have a Bachelor of Science

an expert but I did work as a nurse Tech
 
00:17:04.909 --> 00:17:04.919 align:start position:0%

those infants and their parents
 
00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:13.260 align:start position:0%
as for my personal background all of
 
00:17:15.049 --> 00:17:15.059 align:start position:0%
which is on public record because I have
 
00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:17.400 align:start position:0%
used it previously as testimony In This
 
00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:18.660 align:start position:0%
Very haul
 
00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:21.720 align:start position:0%
I was adopted as an infant
 
00:17:23.929 --> 00:17:23.939 align:start position:0%
I released my own daughter for adoption
 
00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
when I was 21.
 
00:17:28.549 --> 00:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
my husband and I have four daughters and
 
00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:31.260 align:start position:0%
two grandchildren I've been there for
 
00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:34.620 align:start position:0%
the birth of both of my grandchildren
 
00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
two of my daughters are single mothers
 
00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
I have spoken with many women about
 
00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:44.580 align:start position:0%
their painful abortion experiences
 
00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:47.960 align:start position:0%
I also survived an emergency C-section
 
00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:51.720 align:start position:0%
in an extremely rare situation where the
 
00:17:54.529 --> 00:17:54.539 align:start position:0%
pregnancy itself put my life in severe
 
00:17:54.539 --> 00:17:55.970 align:start position:0%
pregnancy itself put my life in severe
Danger

00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:55.980 align:start position:0%
Danger
 
00:17:58.549 --> 00:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
I survived
 
00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:00.720 align:start position:0%
but my son did not
 
00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
and I would have gladly traded places
 
00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:04.140 align:start position:0%
with him
 
00:18:06.169 --> 00:18:06.179 align:start position:0%
I will not be taking questions about my
 
00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
personal history today but I offer my
 
00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:11.580 align:start position:0%
experiences as a resource to the
 
00:18:14.049 --> 00:18:14.059 align:start position:0%
committee regarding any of the ethics
 
00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:17.100 align:start position:0%
surrounding that particular situation
 
00:18:19.789 --> 00:18:19.799 align:start position:0%
now to get to this simple bill
 
00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:22.140 align:start position:0%
let me start with an analogy
 
00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
if a dog fell through the ice on one of
 
00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:26.820 align:start position:0%
our beautiful lakes
 
00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
the rescue of that dog would make local
 
00:18:32.029 --> 00:18:32.039 align:start position:0%
if not National headlines
 
00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:34.200 align:start position:0%
everyone involved would be hailed as a
 
00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:35.630 align:start position:0%
everyone involved would be hailed as a
hero

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
hero
 
00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:37.500 align:start position:0%
now I didn't research this but I'm
 
00:18:39.529 --> 00:18:39.539 align:start position:0%
fairly certain that we don't have a law
 
00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:41.340 align:start position:0%
that requires
 
00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:44.700 align:start position:0%
EMS Personnel to rescue a dog in the
 
00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
event that one falls through the ice
 
00:18:50.029 --> 00:18:50.039 align:start position:0%
most of us would agree it's the right
 
00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
thing to do
 
00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:53.940 align:start position:0%
but we are here today to talk about
 
00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
whether a child
 
00:18:59.169 --> 00:18:59.179 align:start position:0%
accidentally born alive
 
00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:02.580 align:start position:0%
accidentally born alive during a
 
00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:03.890 align:start position:0%
accidentally born alive during a
procedure

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:03.900 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:07.500 align:start position:0%
performed with the express intent of
 
00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:10.620 align:start position:0%
killing that child
 
00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
whether or not that child has a
 
00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:15.240 align:start position:0%
fundamental right to life
 
00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
we are going to talk about why or how
 
00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
that child has a right to life after an
 
00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
attempt to kill it
 
00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:25.740 align:start position:0%
now I've listened to all the testimony
 
00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:27.660 align:start position:0%
on the last version of this bill House
 
00:19:31.549 --> 00:19:31.559 align:start position:0%
Bill 233 from 2021 so I familiarize
 
00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
myself with some of the arguments
 
00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
this bill is not meant to interfere with
 
00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:40.860 align:start position:0%
the complex and painful decisions that
 
00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:43.260 align:start position:0%
parents must make when they have a child
 
00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:46.260 align:start position:0%
born with complications that might make
 
00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:49.020 align:start position:0%
it inhumane to attempt life-sustaining
 
00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:49.970 align:start position:0%
it inhumane to attempt life-sustaining
treatment

00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:49.980 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:52.860 align:start position:0%
this bill does not intend to disallow
 
00:19:55.549 --> 00:19:55.559 align:start position:0%
parents to decide how their child should
 
00:19:57.850 --> 00:19:57.860 align:start position:0%
live out the extent of his natural life
 
00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:01.860 align:start position:0%
however long or short that life might be
 
00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
this law does not intend to imply that a
 
00:20:08.029 --> 00:20:08.039 align:start position:0%
woman must keep her child if it is born
 
00:20:11.029 --> 00:20:11.039 align:start position:0%
alive as a side effect
 
00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:13.380 align:start position:0%
of an attempted abortion
 
00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has a safe haven law
 
00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:17.700 align:start position:0%
allowing for the relinquishment of a
 
00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:20.280 align:start position:0%
child without a court order for up to
 
00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:22.020 align:start position:0%
seven days of age
 
00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:25.740 align:start position:0%
adoption is also an option and no the
 
00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
woman never has to see the child ever
 
00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
again if she doesn't want to
 
00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
this bill does not have the intention of
 
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
Prosecuting providers who make the
 
00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:38.280 align:start position:0%
challenging decision of deciding that it
 
00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:40.140 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be in the child's best interest
 
00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:43.140 align:start position:0%
to attempt life-sustaining procedures
 
00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:46.380 align:start position:0%
this bill is only intended to allow an
 
00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:47.529 align:start position:0%
this bill is only intended to allow an
infant

00:20:47.529 --> 00:20:47.539 align:start position:0%
infant
 
00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:51.080 align:start position:0%
accidentally born alive
 
00:20:54.049 --> 00:20:54.059 align:start position:0%
accidentally born alive
 
00:20:57.529 --> 00:20:57.539 align:start position:0%
because of a failed attempt to kill it
 
00:20:59.510 --> 00:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
to have the fundamental right to life
 
00:21:02.029 --> 00:21:02.039 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:04.200 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm next going to call on
 
00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
representative Jeannie notter please
 
00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:09.780 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:11.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and good morning
 
00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:12.900 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
this is my 13th year here
 
00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:18.660 align:start position:0%
I made a promise to defend and stand up
 
00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
for innocent human life
 
00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:22.380 align:start position:0%
and I feel sorry for them because I'm
 
00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:23.940 align:start position:0%
not the best speaker
 
00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:25.980 align:start position:0%
do the best I can
 
00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:28.740 align:start position:0%
in the words of Dr Seuss a person is a
 
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
person no matter how small
 
00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:33.780 align:start position:0%
the fetal Life protection act cover only
 
00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
covers children old enough to live on
 
00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:37.380 align:start position:0%
their own at her about six months of
 
00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
given the chance
 
00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:40.980 align:start position:0%
delivery is always a safer option for
 
00:21:43.850 --> 00:21:43.860 align:start position:0%
the mother and saves the child's life
 
00:21:45.649 --> 00:21:45.659 align:start position:0%
we should focus on the child who is
 
00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
totally innocent is intentionally killed
 
00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:50.220 align:start position:0%
and has a life expectancy of some
 
00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:53.570 align:start position:0%
and has a life expectancy of some
duration

00:21:53.570 --> 00:21:53.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:55.909 --> 00:21:55.919 align:start position:0%
the fetal Life protection act agrees
 
00:21:58.669 --> 00:21:58.679 align:start position:0%
with all the four countries and most
 
00:22:00.409 --> 00:22:00.419 align:start position:0%
countries banned abortions after 12 or
 
00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:02.580 align:start position:0%
15 weeks
 
00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:05.340 align:start position:0%
no other medical procedure causes the
 
00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:10.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:13.740 align:start position:0%
have you heard of Kermit Gosnell
 
00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:16.500 align:start position:0%
he ran that disgusting horrible filthy
 
00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
Clinic that was not safe for women and
 
00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:20.460 align:start position:0%
definitely not safe for the the babies
 
00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:23.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:25.320 align:start position:0%
if a baby is born alive after an
 
00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:27.720 align:start position:0%
abortion it is cruel and inhumane not to
 
00:22:30.409 --> 00:22:30.419 align:start position:0%
try and save that child
 
00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
Gosnell may have severed the spines of
 
00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:34.620 align:start position:0%
hundreds of born Alive babies with
 
00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:35.930 align:start position:0%
hundreds of born Alive babies with
scissors

00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:35.940 align:start position:0%
scissors
 
00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:38.340 align:start position:0%
one employee testified that she
 
00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
witnessed Gosnell snipped the necks of
 
00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
more than 30 babies and that he
 
00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:44.820 align:start position:0%
sometimes gave her just the feet of a
 
00:22:48.409 --> 00:22:48.419 align:start position:0%
fetus to place in formaldehyde
 
00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
one employee testified that the baby
 
00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:53.700 align:start position:0%
a baby still alive after being aborted
 
00:22:55.669 --> 00:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
screamed one night and that the baby's
 
00:22:57.169 --> 00:22:57.179 align:start position:0%
eyes and mouth were not yet completely
 
00:22:59.750 --> 00:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
formed but that it was still alive
 
00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:02.280 align:start position:0%
the baby was so big that Gosnell joked
 
00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:05.580 align:start position:0%
that this baby's going to walk me home
 
00:23:07.549 --> 00:23:07.559 align:start position:0%
one of the babies was reportedly moving
 
00:23:09.169 --> 00:23:09.179 align:start position:0%
and breathing for 20 minutes before an
 
00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:15.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
I'm just highlighting things so I don't
 
00:23:19.669 --> 00:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
keep you too long
 
00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
I'm going to give you the names of four
 
00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
or five survivors of abortion one of
 
00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:27.240 align:start position:0%
them I mentioned yesterday Janet Jensen
 
00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
who I've met and interviewed I used to
 
00:23:31.909 --> 00:23:31.919 align:start position:0%
be a freelance writer I still I still do
 
00:23:31.919 --> 00:23:33.230 align:start position:0%
be a freelance writer I still I still do
interviews

00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:33.240 align:start position:0%
interviews
 
00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
she survived a saline abortion so what
 
00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
is that it's a saline solution that has
 
00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:41.220 align:start position:0%
things in it that I can't pronounce I
 
00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:43.500 align:start position:0%
can accept potassium chloride and saline
 
00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:44.460 align:start position:0%
of course
 
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:46.140 align:start position:0%
which is injected into the mother's
 
00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:48.360 align:start position:0%
uterus and into the baby the saline
 
00:23:51.049 --> 00:23:51.059 align:start position:0%
solution poisons the baby I'm going to
 
00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:52.500 align:start position:0%
say her instead of him and her because
 
00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
of Gianna burning her inside and out
 
00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:57.240 align:start position:0%
burning off the outer layer of her skin
 
00:23:59.810 --> 00:23:59.820 align:start position:0%
the baby suffers in these conditions for
 
00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:01.620 align:start position:0%
over an hour until she dies and the
 
00:24:03.169 --> 00:24:03.179 align:start position:0%
mother must deliver her dead child after
 
00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:04.740 align:start position:0%
about one day
 
00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:07.380 align:start position:0%
Gianna Jensen survived her mother's
 
00:24:09.649 --> 00:24:09.659 align:start position:0%
late-term abortion because
 
00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:11.640 align:start position:0%
somebody took pity on her and called an
 
00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:14.029 align:start position:0%
somebody took pity on her and called an
ambulance

00:24:14.029 --> 00:24:14.039 align:start position:0%
ambulance
 
00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:17.220 align:start position:0%
Melissa Odin survived a saline abortion
 
00:24:18.529 --> 00:24:18.539 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:24:21.049 --> 00:24:21.059 align:start position:0%
she says something's wrong when women's
 
00:24:23.029 --> 00:24:23.039 align:start position:0%
empowerment is based on ending another
 
00:24:25.789 --> 00:24:25.799 align:start position:0%
human being's life
 
00:24:27.649 --> 00:24:27.659 align:start position:0%
Claire cutwell
 
00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:29.580 align:start position:0%
survived an abortion that killed her
 
00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:31.740 align:start position:0%
twin brother so her mother didn't know
 
00:24:33.049 --> 00:24:33.059 align:start position:0%
that she was pregnant with twins they
 
00:24:34.789 --> 00:24:34.799 align:start position:0%
only aborted one of the babies but the
 
00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:37.500 align:start position:0%
mother kept feeling kicking
 
00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:40.380 align:start position:0%
and she ended up having the baby and the
 
00:24:42.169 --> 00:24:42.179 align:start position:0%
baby was adopted
 
00:24:45.409 --> 00:24:45.419 align:start position:0%
raised in a loving family
 
00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:47.820 align:start position:0%
and then the last one was I a Priestly
 
00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:50.580 align:start position:0%
was born after an incomplete abortion so
 
00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:52.860 align:start position:0%
he was born without his arm oh and then
 
00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:55.020 align:start position:0%
there was one more the same story but
 
00:24:57.169 --> 00:24:57.179 align:start position:0%
what's interesting was that they didn't
 
00:24:59.090 --> 00:24:59.100 align:start position:0%
they didn't uh hate their their birth
 
00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
mothers they were able to forgive them
 
00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
because of a given life because all life
 
00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
is precious
 
00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to leave these packets of
 
00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:10.620 align:start position:0%
information with you for further study

00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:52.200 align:start position:0%
I just want to point out a couple things
 
00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to we're going to hear a lot
 
00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:55.740 align:start position:0%
of testimony today
 
00:25:58.610 --> 00:25:58.620 align:start position:0%
pros and cons both ways
 
00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:01.860 align:start position:0%
you know and we all understand we don't
 
00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
want anybody trampling on our rights and
 
00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:05.700 align:start position:0%
what we're able to do and what we can't
 
00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
do but here we are you know
 
00:26:12.169 --> 00:26:12.179 align:start position:0%
2023 and we have to have some of these
 
00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:14.460 align:start position:0%
laws and and even including this one
 
00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:15.289 align:start position:0%
laws and and even including this one
here

00:26:15.289 --> 00:26:15.299 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:17.700 align:start position:0%
and let me just State up front I I
 
00:26:21.529 --> 00:26:21.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:23.640 align:start position:0%
but this large you know
 
00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:26.700 align:start position:0%
it's it's a shame it's an absolute shame
 
00:26:28.549 --> 00:26:28.559 align:start position:0%
that we absolutely need this I can't
 
00:26:28.559 --> 00:26:29.930 align:start position:0%
that we absolutely need this I can't
believe

00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:29.940 align:start position:0%
believe
 
00:26:34.549 --> 00:26:34.559 align:start position:0%
as a civilization as a society we have
 
00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
to put a law in place to protect a child
 
00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
an infant
 
00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:42.900 align:start position:0%
that for somehow came out of the womb
 
00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:49.640 align:start position:0%
what are we doing
 
00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
we're killing off our heritage
 
00:27:01.549 --> 00:27:01.559 align:start position:0%
I don't understand why we would
 
00:27:03.529 --> 00:27:03.539 align:start position:0%
absolutely do this I really don't and I
 
00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
mean I I really respect the people on
 
00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
both sides of the issue here but this is
 
00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:11.400 align:start position:0%
to me it's ludicrous I mean it does not
 
00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:13.320 align:start position:0%
make sense at all
 
00:27:15.409 --> 00:27:15.419 align:start position:0%
and I just want to point out here on
 
00:27:19.909 --> 00:27:19.919 align:start position:0%
first page line at 29.
 
00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:25.980 align:start position:0%
says it shall be you know
 
00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:29.460 align:start position:0%
shall be treated in any other natural it
 
00:27:32.269 --> 00:27:32.279 align:start position:0%
shall be treated as any AD no excuse me
 
00:27:35.269 --> 00:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
shall be treated as any other natural
 
00:27:38.409 --> 00:27:38.419 align:start position:0%
person under the laws
 
00:27:38.419 --> 00:27:40.570 align:start position:0%
person under the laws
okay

00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:40.580 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
the infant's alive
 
00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:46.500 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't it be treated as any other
 
00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:50.400 align:start position:0%
person under the law again
 
00:27:53.029 --> 00:27:53.039 align:start position:0%
it's a shame we have to have this I
 
00:27:56.930 --> 00:27:56.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:58.970 --> 00:27:58.980 align:start position:0%
it's just humble it's beyond me it's
 
00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:00.289 align:start position:0%
it's just humble it's beyond me it's
baffled

00:28:00.289 --> 00:28:00.299 align:start position:0%
baffled
 
00:28:01.909 --> 00:28:01.919 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure it's beyond some of you as
 
00:28:01.919 --> 00:28:03.830 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure it's beyond some of you as
well

00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:28:06.529 --> 00:28:06.539 align:start position:0%
the infants alive
 
00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:14.580 align:start position:0%
but this last thing here is on page two
 
00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:20.930 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:20.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
shall be entitled to no less protection
 
00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:28.740 align:start position:0%
a remedy under the state's criminal laws
 
00:28:32.090 --> 00:28:32.100 align:start position:0%
just like us just like you and me
 
00:28:34.549 --> 00:28:34.559 align:start position:0%
we would we would not we should never
 
00:28:37.909 --> 00:28:37.919 align:start position:0%
ever expect any different from an infant
 
00:28:39.169 --> 00:28:39.179 align:start position:0%
part of life
 
00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:41.940 align:start position:0%
all right it wasn't or anything else
 
00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:42.670 align:start position:0%

um next I'm going to call on uh Danielle
 
00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:02.940 align:start position:0%
Pimentel and the next person after that
 
00:29:05.029 --> 00:29:05.039 align:start position:0%
I forgot to do that before will be
 
00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:09.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:14.700 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman and members of
 
00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Danielle
 
00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
Pimentel and I serve as policy Council
 
00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:21.240 align:start position:0%
on Americans United for life which is a
 
00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:23.220 align:start position:0%
non-profit national law and policy
 
00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:25.260 align:start position:0%
nonprofit organization that specializes
 
00:29:28.490 --> 00:29:28.500 align:start position:0%
in abortion end of life issues and
 
00:29:30.889 --> 00:29:30.899 align:start position:0%
bioethics law and today I urge the
 
00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:34.620 align:start position:0%
committee to support HB 346 for two
 
00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
reasons first it is critical to
 
00:29:39.769 --> 00:29:39.779 align:start position:0%
increasing the survival rates and
 
00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:41.460 align:start position:0%
providing Comfort Care to Born alive
 
00:29:43.789 --> 00:29:43.799 align:start position:0%
infant survivors and two it is critical
 
00:29:45.889 --> 00:29:45.899 align:start position:0%
that is a critical supplement pardon me
 
00:29:48.289 --> 00:29:48.299 align:start position:0%
to Federal Protection for born alive
 
00:29:48.299 --> 00:29:49.730 align:start position:0%
to Federal Protection for born alive
infants

00:29:49.730 --> 00:29:49.740 align:start position:0%
infants
 
00:29:51.889 --> 00:29:51.899 align:start position:0%
to my first Point Medical intervention
 
00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:54.240 align:start position:0%
is critical to increasing the survival
 
00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
rates and alleviating the suffering of
 
00:29:59.889 --> 00:29:59.899 align:start position:0%
um of born alive infant survivors
 
00:30:02.450 --> 00:30:02.460 align:start position:0%
advancements in medical technology have
 
00:30:04.549 --> 00:30:04.559 align:start position:0%
allowed medical professionals to save
 
00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:07.140 align:start position:0%
prematurely born children at younger
 
00:30:09.169 --> 00:30:09.179 align:start position:0%
gestational ages we even heard yesterday
 
00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:11.220 align:start position:0%
testimony from someone that said that
 
00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:13.740 align:start position:0%
they knew a baby that was born at 19
 
00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:16.200 align:start position:0%
weeks and it's now a fully healthy young
 
00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:17.750 align:start position:0%
weeks and it's now a fully healthy young
adult

00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
adult
 
00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:19.740 align:start position:0%
um pre-born children as young as 21
 
00:30:21.529 --> 00:30:21.539 align:start position:0%
weeks gestation have been able to
 
00:30:23.389 --> 00:30:23.399 align:start position:0%
survive outside the womb and reports
 
00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:25.980 align:start position:0%
from the CDC show that there are still
 
00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:28.620 align:start position:0%
as many as 10 000 abortions in the U.S
 
00:30:31.549 --> 00:30:31.559 align:start position:0%
that occur at or after 21 weeks
 
00:30:31.559 --> 00:30:32.930 align:start position:0%
that occur at or after 21 weeks
gestation

00:30:32.930 --> 00:30:32.940 align:start position:0%
gestation
 
00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
however a peri-viable infant is a
 
00:30:37.789 --> 00:30:37.799 align:start position:0%
critically ill patient due to the
 
00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:40.200 align:start position:0%
developmental immaturity and needs
 
00:30:42.289 --> 00:30:42.299 align:start position:0%
credit critical Medical Care
 
00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:44.700 align:start position:0%
so the bill protects these infants all
 
00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:46.200 align:start position:0%
infants were alive regardless of their
 
00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
gestational age at the time of birth and
 
00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:52.260 align:start position:0%
medical pioneering teams are working and
 
00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:53.820 align:start position:0%
have been working for years to increase
 
00:30:55.850 --> 00:30:55.860 align:start position:0%
the survival rates for extremely
 
00:30:57.529 --> 00:30:57.539 align:start position:0%
prematured babies
 
00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
and pre-viable infants born alive have
 
00:31:03.049 --> 00:31:03.059 align:start position:0%
the same human dignity that we all do
 
00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:05.340 align:start position:0%
and deserve comfort and care which they
 
00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:07.320 align:start position:0%
would receive under this bill
 
00:31:09.049 --> 00:31:09.059 align:start position:0%
medical professionals can provide
 
00:31:11.269 --> 00:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
perinatal palliative care to these young
 
00:31:13.909 --> 00:31:13.919 align:start position:0%
patients which focuses on maximizing the
 
00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:16.740 align:start position:0%
quality of life and comfort for the
 
00:31:18.289 --> 00:31:18.299 align:start position:0%
newborns with a variety of different
 
00:31:20.570 --> 00:31:20.580 align:start position:0%
conditions considered to be life
 
00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:21.830 align:start position:0%
conditions considered to be life
limiting

00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
limiting
 
00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
and while there isn't a standardized
 
00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:26.240 align:start position:0%
abortion reporting
 
00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
system in the U.S the reports that are
 
00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:32.580 align:start position:0%
available still show it is not a myth
 
00:31:35.169 --> 00:31:35.179 align:start position:0%
that there are infants born alive
 
00:31:38.090 --> 00:31:38.100 align:start position:0%
following an abortion procedure for
 
00:31:41.570 --> 00:31:41.580 align:start position:0%
example one CDC report found that over a
 
00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:45.200 align:start position:0%
12-year period at least 143 babies
 
00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
survived the abortion procedure before
 
00:31:49.370 --> 00:31:49.380 align:start position:0%
ultimately passing away
 
00:31:51.289 --> 00:31:51.299 align:start position:0%
but the CDC notes that it's possible
 
00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:54.240 align:start position:0%
this number is actually underestimated
 
00:31:58.549 --> 00:31:58.559 align:start position:0%
another study found that of the 20 241
 
00:32:00.769 --> 00:32:00.779 align:start position:0%
pre-born children aborted for having a
 
00:32:03.649 --> 00:32:03.659 align:start position:0%
fetal anomaly between 20 and 24 weeks
 
00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
gestational age
 
00:32:09.889 --> 00:32:09.899 align:start position:0%
122 infants survived the procedure
 
00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:12.120 align:start position:0%
research organizations or another
 
00:32:13.610 --> 00:32:13.620 align:start position:0%
research organization the Charlotte
 
00:32:15.889 --> 00:32:15.899 align:start position:0%
loser Institute has gathered information
 
00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:18.360 align:start position:0%
from the States from voluntary State
 
00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
abortion reports and it found that 35
 
00:32:24.169 --> 00:32:24.179 align:start position:0%
infants were born alive in Arizona in
 
00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:27.240 align:start position:0%
Florida in Minnesota and in Texas in
 
00:32:29.330 --> 00:32:29.340 align:start position:0%
2020 and 2021
 
00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
eight babies were born alive in Florida
 
00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:34.200 align:start position:0%
in 2022.
 
00:32:37.330 --> 00:32:37.340 align:start position:0%
in this regard infants are surviving
 
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
attempted abortions and they are in
 
00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:42.360 align:start position:0%
critical need of medical intervention to
 
00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:44.340 align:start position:0%
increase their chances of survival
 
00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:46.140 align:start position:0%
and to provide comfort care which this
 
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
bill would ensure
 
00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:50.100 align:start position:0%
the last point I'll make very briefly is
 
00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
that hb346 supplements the federal born
 
00:32:56.450 --> 00:32:56.460 align:start position:0%
alive infant protection acts providing
 
00:32:58.970 --> 00:32:58.980 align:start position:0%
necessary and Common Sense protections
 
00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
for born alive infants
 
00:33:05.090 --> 00:33:05.100 align:start position:0%
as we all know in 2002 the Congress U.S
 
00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:07.620 align:start position:0%
Congress passed the born alive infant
 
00:33:09.049 --> 00:33:09.059 align:start position:0%
protection act
 
00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:10.440 align:start position:0%
um clarifying that federal law
 
00:33:12.889 --> 00:33:12.899 align:start position:0%
recognizes that infants born alive at
 
00:33:15.409 --> 00:33:15.419 align:start position:0%
any stage of development
 
00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:17.640 align:start position:0%
um or the law recognizes that these
 
00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:19.620 align:start position:0%
infants as persons
 
00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:22.440 align:start position:0%
however while the law acknowledges the
 
00:33:24.370 --> 00:33:24.380 align:start position:0%
that all born alive events are equal
 
00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:27.720 align:start position:0%
have equal standing regardless of their
 
00:33:29.509 --> 00:33:29.519 align:start position:0%
circumstances of their birth the law
 
00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:31.620 align:start position:0%
does not ensure that these infants will
 
00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:35.100 align:start position:0%
receive a life-saving protection
 
00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
and this bill however does that and it's
 
00:33:40.610 --> 00:33:40.620 align:start position:0%
still necessary to require an
 
00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
affirmative action by a position to
 
00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
ensure that an infant born alive after
 
00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
an abortion receive the same level of
 
00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:52.140 align:start position:0%
medical care as any other infant would
 
00:33:56.269 --> 00:33:56.279 align:start position:0%
then HB 346 is more comprehensive than
 
00:33:58.130 --> 00:33:58.140 align:start position:0%
the federal protections and fills in the
 
00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
gaps by extending protections for all
 
00:34:03.289 --> 00:34:03.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
um for these reasons I strongly urge the
 
00:34:07.909 --> 00:34:07.919 align:start position:0%
committee to support this bill and I'm
 
00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:09.480 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions questions
 
00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:13.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:15.829 --> 00:34:15.839 align:start position:0%
thank you very much so uh Americans
 
00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
United for life is a well-known um Pro
 
00:34:21.470 --> 00:34:21.480 align:start position:0%
pro-life group I'll call it are you is
 
00:34:22.970 --> 00:34:22.980 align:start position:0%
this a homegrown Bill and you're just
 
00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:25.320 align:start position:0%
coming up to support the sponsors or is
 
00:34:26.629 --> 00:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
this something that your organization
 
00:34:29.329 --> 00:34:29.339 align:start position:0%
had a role in drafting
 
00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
yes our organization
 
00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
um focuses on policy throughout the
 
00:34:35.450 --> 00:34:35.460 align:start position:0%
states and so I'm policy Council and my
 
00:34:37.970 --> 00:34:37.980 align:start position:0%
focus is the Northeast and so we support
 
00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
pro-life bills across the states
 
00:34:42.169 --> 00:34:42.179 align:start position:0%
um and want to see life-affirming
 
00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
other questions follow-up you're
 
00:34:49.490 --> 00:34:49.500 align:start position:0%
probably the first person asked if some
 
00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
how how long after a person is born are
 
00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
they an infant I mean obviously this
 
00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:56.270 align:start position:0%
they an infant I mean obviously this
uh

00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:34:58.430 --> 00:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
I mean this even I could theoretically
 
00:34:59.930 --> 00:34:59.940 align:start position:0%
be called the Born To Life infant
 
00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:01.560 align:start position:0%
because I was born alive but uh
 
00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:03.900 align:start position:0%
obviously is there a time frame
 
00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:05.940 align:start position:0%
that at least you would Vision this bill
 
00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:07.800 align:start position:0%
applying to
 
00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:09.960 align:start position:0%
well I'm not a medical professional so I
 
00:35:12.349 --> 00:35:12.359 align:start position:0%
don't know the actual definition of when
 
00:35:13.849 --> 00:35:13.859 align:start position:0%
a baby
 
00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
baby but most of the time that is I
 
00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
would assume generally within the first
 
00:35:20.329 --> 00:35:20.339 align:start position:0%
year of their birth
 
00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
other other questions
 
00:35:26.569 --> 00:35:26.579 align:start position:0%
yes representative greeson thank you Mr
 
00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:28.020 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for your testimony
 
00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:32.040 align:start position:0%
this morning understanding that uh a
 
00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:34.440 align:start position:0%
physician or a medical personnel is
 
00:35:37.130 --> 00:35:37.140 align:start position:0%
attempting to provide the medical care
 
00:35:39.890 --> 00:35:39.900 align:start position:0%
for an infant born alive
 
00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:41.690 align:start position:0%
for an infant born alive
uh

00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:41.700 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:35:45.829 --> 00:35:45.839 align:start position:0%
to what extent must the care continue uh
 
00:35:47.930 --> 00:35:47.940 align:start position:0%
if if there are attempts and it dies do
 
00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:49.800 align:start position:0%
they try to resuscitate it if they're
 
00:35:51.589 --> 00:35:51.599 align:start position:0%
able to resuscitate it and it dies again
 
00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:54.540 align:start position:0%
they resuscitate it again how long are
 
00:35:56.770 --> 00:35:56.780 align:start position:0%
they required to continue to perform
 
00:35:59.210 --> 00:35:59.220 align:start position:0%
this life-saving or attempted
 
00:36:01.370 --> 00:36:01.380 align:start position:0%
life-saving care before then they can
 
00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:03.900 align:start position:0%
just say okay the baby now passes away
 
00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
right well if we look at the bill
 
00:36:08.930 --> 00:36:08.940 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to turn to it so I can
 
00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:11.220 align:start position:0%
look at it with you
 
00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:19.010 align:start position:0%
look at it with you
um

00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:25.790 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:27.770 --> 00:36:27.780 align:start position:0%
so the bill States obviously that that
 
00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:29.640 align:start position:0%
any infant born alive shall be treated
 
00:36:32.089 --> 00:36:32.099 align:start position:0%
as any other natural person under the
 
00:36:34.310 --> 00:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
laws and at the same time
 
00:36:36.890 --> 00:36:36.900 align:start position:0%
um any of the laws including any part of
 
00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
me any of the laws on the state wish to
 
00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
punish a remedy harm to Natural persons
 
00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
including love referring to another
 
00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
Etc and so even though the law doesn't
 
00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:45.780 align:start position:0%
say specifically how far that would
 
00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:47.329 align:start position:0%
say specifically how far that would
extend

00:36:47.329 --> 00:36:47.339 align:start position:0%
extend
 
00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:51.060 align:start position:0%
um I mean it it the law is following
 
00:36:52.970 --> 00:36:52.980 align:start position:0%
what's already in place for other
 
00:36:56.089 --> 00:36:56.099 align:start position:0%
infants and so with Physicians um how
 
00:36:57.770 --> 00:36:57.780 align:start position:0%
this would probably apply is that they
 
00:36:59.510 --> 00:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
would do within their reasonable medical
 
00:37:01.490 --> 00:37:01.500 align:start position:0%
judgment to
 
00:37:03.109 --> 00:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
um you know give this baby care medical
 
00:37:04.609 --> 00:37:04.619 align:start position:0%
treatment along the medical treatment
 
00:37:07.310 --> 00:37:07.320 align:start position:0%
standards and if that baby dies and
 
00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:08.700 align:start position:0%
there's a chance of resuscitating then
 
00:37:10.069 --> 00:37:10.079 align:start position:0%
they have their own reasonable medical
 
00:37:12.589 --> 00:37:12.599 align:start position:0%
judgment to do so
 
00:37:14.329 --> 00:37:14.339 align:start position:0%
um however the law is not going to
 
00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:15.720 align:start position:0%
require them to continue to try to
 
00:37:18.109 --> 00:37:18.119 align:start position:0%
resuscitate a baby if that's not you
 
00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
know something that they think would be
 
00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
able to actually resuscitate them right
 
00:37:27.349 --> 00:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:29.569 --> 00:37:29.579 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much uh
 
00:37:32.990 --> 00:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
Christine our show and then next will be
 
00:37:38.829 --> 00:37:38.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
hello my name is Dr Christine Arsenal
 
00:37:45.829 --> 00:37:45.839 align:start position:0%
um I am a pediatrician and mother of
 
00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
three children and I'm speaking today on
 
00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:49.560 align:start position:0%
behalf of myself and the New Hampshire
 
00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
chapter of the American Academy of
 
00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:52.970 align:start position:0%

Pediatrics
 
00:37:56.270 --> 00:37:56.280 align:start position:0%
I am here to oppose house bill 346. I
 
00:37:58.370 --> 00:37:58.380 align:start position:0%
want to start out by saying
 
00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:01.140 align:start position:0%
despite what we have heard so far this
 
00:38:04.609 --> 00:38:04.619 align:start position:0%
bill is not about abortion
 
00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
the people who this bill would affect
 
00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
our families faced with a tragedy that I
 
00:38:16.970 --> 00:38:16.980 align:start position:0%
think any parent any expectant parent
 
00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
has considered
 
00:38:22.069 --> 00:38:22.079 align:start position:0%
and felt fortunate not to have to endure
 
00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:25.380 align:start position:0%
which is experiencing
 
00:38:28.490 --> 00:38:28.500 align:start position:0%
the delivery of a baby with a fetal a
 
00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:31.020 align:start position:0%
fatal condition
 
00:38:33.349 --> 00:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
for several years I worked in a level
 
00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
two NICU and attended the delivery of
 
00:38:37.970 --> 00:38:37.980 align:start position:0%
numerous newborns any time there was
 
00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:40.200 align:start position:0%
considered to be some sort of risk at
 
00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
every delivery that I attended
 
00:38:46.069 --> 00:38:46.079 align:start position:0%
the team and I followed protocols to
 
00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:47.880 align:start position:0%
support the newborn as it transitioned
 
00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
to life outside of the uterus this is
 
00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
what doctors and nurses do in almost
 
00:38:56.210 --> 00:38:56.220 align:start position:0%
every circumstance
 
00:38:58.670 --> 00:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
rarely as we've sort of heard some of
 
00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
the supporters mention expectant parents
 
00:39:04.069 --> 00:39:04.079 align:start position:0%
will learn that their fetus has a
 
00:39:06.589 --> 00:39:06.599 align:start position:0%
medical condition that will not allow it
 
00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
to live independently
 
00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
an example of this which I believe was
 
00:39:13.490 --> 00:39:13.500 align:start position:0%
mentioned is anencephaly when the fetus
 
00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:17.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:20.329 --> 00:39:20.339 align:start position:0%
in these um tragic cases when the family
 
00:39:23.329 --> 00:39:23.339 align:start position:0%
learns of these diagnoses they will meet
 
00:39:25.310 --> 00:39:25.320 align:start position:0%
with a palliative care team and their OB
 
00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
GYN and receive extensive counseling on
 
00:39:30.349 --> 00:39:30.359 align:start position:0%
their options
 
00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
some of these families choose to carry
 
00:39:35.210 --> 00:39:35.220 align:start position:0%
their pregnancy to term deliver their
 
00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:38.280 align:start position:0%
baby and spend some time with the infant
 
00:39:41.089 --> 00:39:41.099 align:start position:0%
to peacefully and privately grieve
 
00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:43.260 align:start position:0%
before the baby passes away
 
00:39:45.109 --> 00:39:45.119 align:start position:0%
now we have heard some of the supporters
 
00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:46.680 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
00:39:49.310 --> 00:39:49.320 align:start position:0%
say that this law doesn't apply to these
 
00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:50.690 align:start position:0%
say that this law doesn't apply to these
families

00:39:50.690 --> 00:39:50.700 align:start position:0%
families
 
00:39:52.730 --> 00:39:52.740 align:start position:0%
the problem is the way it's written it
 
00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:53.690 align:start position:0%
the problem is the way it's written it
does

00:39:53.690 --> 00:39:53.700 align:start position:0%
does
 
00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:55.190 align:start position:0%
does
so

00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:57.170 align:start position:0%
so
I

00:39:57.170 --> 00:39:57.180 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:39:58.970 --> 00:39:58.980 align:start position:0%
cannot imagine
 
00:40:02.210 --> 00:40:02.220 align:start position:0%
having to whisk these babies away to
 
00:40:03.890 --> 00:40:03.900 align:start position:0%
perform chest compressions insert
 
00:40:06.109 --> 00:40:06.119 align:start position:0%
breathing tubes and transfer them to a
 
00:40:08.990 --> 00:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
institution with a higher level of care
 
00:40:12.290 --> 00:40:12.300 align:start position:0%
because frankly if if the penalty were a
 
00:40:16.490 --> 00:40:16.500 align:start position:0%
felony which is what this bill proposes
 
00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
that that would be what we had to do as
 
00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
providers unless we wanted to face
 
00:40:22.609 --> 00:40:22.619 align:start position:0%
prison time
 
00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
these conversations and these cases are
 
00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:30.180 align:start position:0%
so nuanced and having a law requiring
 
00:40:35.630 --> 00:40:35.640 align:start position:0%
that every single baby be resuscitated
 
00:40:37.730 --> 00:40:37.740 align:start position:0%
puts providers
 
00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:39.780 align:start position:0%
in an impossible and families in an
 
00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
impossible position
 
00:40:43.730 --> 00:40:43.740 align:start position:0%
if parents of a newborn desire their
 
00:40:46.370 --> 00:40:46.380 align:start position:0%
baby to be resuscitated the medical team
 
00:40:48.829 --> 00:40:48.839 align:start position:0%
will never question that choice and will
 
00:40:51.589 --> 00:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
always uphold that choice however
 
00:40:54.650 --> 00:40:54.660 align:start position:0%
in the rare tragic circumstances when
 
00:40:57.050 --> 00:40:57.060 align:start position:0%
parents make a decision to allow their
 
00:40:59.329 --> 00:40:59.339 align:start position:0%
baby to die peacefully in their arms
 
00:41:02.450 --> 00:41:02.460 align:start position:0%
rather than live a brief Life marred by
 
00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
aggressive Interventional procedures we
 
00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
owe them that
 
00:41:08.690 --> 00:41:08.700 align:start position:0%
I urge you to vote inexpedient to
 
00:41:11.690 --> 00:41:11.700 align:start position:0%
legislate on House Bill 346. thank you
 
00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness yes yes
 
00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:17.750 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness yes yes
representative

00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:22.370 --> 00:41:22.380 align:start position:0%
if the spell were to be amended to
 
00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
exclude some of these situations such as
 
00:41:28.069 --> 00:41:28.079 align:start position:0%
you know a baby being born you know with
 
00:41:30.770 --> 00:41:30.780 align:start position:0%
a TBI and suffering you know severe CP
 
00:41:32.450 --> 00:41:32.460 align:start position:0%
and is never going to have
 
00:41:34.609 --> 00:41:34.619 align:start position:0%
a potential quality of life or something
 
00:41:37.069 --> 00:41:37.079 align:start position:0%
of that nature but it offered
 
00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:42.230 align:start position:0%
 
say

00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:45.060 align:start position:0%
a failed abortion attempt at home of
 
00:41:48.349 --> 00:41:48.359 align:start position:0%
somebody that delivered a baby at 26
 
00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:51.240 align:start position:0%
weeks but potentially would be viable
 
00:41:54.109 --> 00:41:54.119 align:start position:0%
and be able to be
 
00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
given care would that be something that
 
00:41:59.089 --> 00:41:59.099 align:start position:0%
you would able to to support would you
 
00:42:01.010 --> 00:42:01.020 align:start position:0%
potentially be willing to work together
 
00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we're protecting the
 
00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
families that want to
 
00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:06.900 align:start position:0%
be able to hold their babies that that
 
00:42:09.349 --> 00:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
have these fatal fetal anomalies but to
 
00:42:13.310 --> 00:42:13.320 align:start position:0%
still protect the life of babies that
 
00:42:15.290 --> 00:42:15.300 align:start position:0%
are viable
 
00:42:17.329 --> 00:42:17.339 align:start position:0%
I think it's interesting because we can
 
00:42:19.730 --> 00:42:19.740 align:start position:0%
hear that on that point we're all on the
 
00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:21.900 align:start position:0%
same page I think
 
00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:22.910 align:start position:0%
same page I think
um

00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
that babies with fatal anomalies should
 
00:42:27.349 --> 00:42:27.359 align:start position:0%
parents should be allowed to peacefully
 
00:42:27.359 --> 00:42:28.609 align:start position:0%
parents should be allowed to peacefully
agree

00:42:28.609 --> 00:42:28.619 align:start position:0%
agree
 
00:42:28.619 --> 00:42:29.690 align:start position:0%
agree
um

00:42:29.690 --> 00:42:29.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
that never happens unless there is an
 
00:42:35.810 --> 00:42:35.820 align:start position:0%
extensive discussion beforehand with a
 
00:42:38.810 --> 00:42:38.820 align:start position:0%
palliative care team and the family and
 
00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
multiple medical providers if an EMT
 
00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
were to show up at situations such as
 
00:42:46.970 --> 00:42:46.980 align:start position:0%
you describe our default is resuscitate
 
00:42:48.589 --> 00:42:48.599 align:start position:0%
that's our default and there are
 
00:42:50.329 --> 00:42:50.339 align:start position:0%
protocols and we can do it in our sleep
 
00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:52.980 align:start position:0%
because that's our default they're
 
00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:54.530 align:start position:0%
because that's our default they're
um

00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:54.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:57.890 --> 00:42:57.900 align:start position:0%
and it's just impossible to write
 
00:43:00.109 --> 00:43:00.119 align:start position:0%
legislation that considers every
 
00:43:00.119 --> 00:43:02.510 align:start position:0%
legislation that considers every
individual

00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:03.770 align:start position:0%
individual
case

00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:03.780 align:start position:0%
case
 
00:43:07.370 --> 00:43:07.380 align:start position:0%
and that's why these
 
00:43:09.410 --> 00:43:09.420 align:start position:0%
that's why medical providers ethical
 
00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
boards why we exist you know so that we
 
00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:13.550 align:start position:0%
boards why we exist you know so that we
can

00:43:13.550 --> 00:43:13.560 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
go over these problems and Tackle them
 
00:43:18.829 --> 00:43:18.839 align:start position:0%
on an individual basis so no I don't
 
00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
think it's possible to create
 
00:43:22.609 --> 00:43:22.619 align:start position:0%
legislation that can address every
 
00:43:22.619 --> 00:43:23.930 align:start position:0%
legislation that can address every
single

00:43:23.930 --> 00:43:23.940 align:start position:0%
single
 
00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:26.390 align:start position:0%
single
case

00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
case
 
00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:28.010 align:start position:0%
case
questions

00:43:28.010 --> 00:43:28.020 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative Perez
 
00:43:33.349 --> 00:43:33.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:43:35.569 --> 00:43:35.579 align:start position:0%
I have a couple of questions it's my
 
00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
understanding in some of the earlier
 
00:43:39.349 --> 00:43:39.359 align:start position:0%
testimony that one of the big
 
00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
protections of this bill would be a
 
00:43:45.349 --> 00:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
failed abortion at 23 weeks
 
00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
so you have our law allows abortion for
 
00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
any reason up to 24 weeks so you have a
 
00:43:55.849 --> 00:43:55.859 align:start position:0%
failed abortion
 
00:43:59.809 --> 00:43:59.819 align:start position:0%
at 24 weeks I'm assuming these abortions
 
00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
are going to take place they can't take
 
00:44:04.250 --> 00:44:04.260 align:start position:0%
place that I've learned yesterday at
 
00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
um Planned Parenthood so you have a
 
00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:09.770 align:start position:0%
um Planned Parenthood so you have a
perfectly

00:44:09.770 --> 00:44:09.780 align:start position:0%
perfectly
 
00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:11.809 align:start position:0%
perfectly
healthy

00:44:11.809 --> 00:44:11.819 align:start position:0%
healthy
 
00:44:16.250 --> 00:44:16.260 align:start position:0%
child being aborted at 23 weeks and that
 
00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
abortion is failed
 
00:44:23.089 --> 00:44:23.099 align:start position:0%
and the baby is born alive
 
00:44:26.690 --> 00:44:26.700 align:start position:0%
I believe this bill is to protect that
 
00:44:29.890 --> 00:44:29.900 align:start position:0%
so is there anywhere in your practice
 
00:44:35.089 --> 00:44:35.099 align:start position:0%
that would allow you to
 
00:44:37.550 --> 00:44:37.560 align:start position:0%
hasten the death
 
00:44:40.970 --> 00:44:40.980 align:start position:0%
of a child of a failed abortion who was
 
00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
perfectly healthy
 
00:44:46.970 --> 00:44:46.980 align:start position:0%
no doctor would ever hasten the death of
 
00:44:48.170 --> 00:44:48.180 align:start position:0%
a child
 
00:44:50.270 --> 00:44:50.280 align:start position:0%
okay so we're talking about so if
 
00:44:53.210 --> 00:44:53.220 align:start position:0%
there's a failed abortion the I am I am
 
00:44:55.849 --> 00:44:55.859 align:start position:0%
not a an abortion provider right I
 
00:45:00.109 --> 00:45:00.119 align:start position:0%
believe that these questions are meant
 
00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
to distract from the people that the
 
00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
bill would actually harm
 
00:45:07.370 --> 00:45:07.380 align:start position:0%
I think it was made very clear that
 
00:45:09.829 --> 00:45:09.839 align:start position:0%
holding your baby when they have only a
 
00:45:12.349 --> 00:45:12.359 align:start position:0%
little time but I think this bill it's
 
00:45:14.690 --> 00:45:14.700 align:start position:0%
my understanding is to protect the
 
00:45:17.450 --> 00:45:17.460 align:start position:0%
failed abortion of a 23-week that could
 
00:45:20.450 --> 00:45:20.460 align:start position:0%
survive I know we do not allow euphemism
 
00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:23.160 align:start position:0%
in this state is that correct
 
00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
so I think this is to protect the child
 
00:45:29.930 --> 00:45:29.940 align:start position:0%
form do you not agree I
 
00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
reading this bill
 
00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
I think of the families who it will
 
00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:36.770 align:start position:0%
I think of the families who it will
affect

00:45:36.770 --> 00:45:36.780 align:start position:0%
affect
 
00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:39.480 align:start position:0%
and that those are the families whose
 
00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:40.849 align:start position:0%
and that those are the families whose
infant

00:45:40.849 --> 00:45:40.859 align:start position:0%
infant
 
00:45:43.790 --> 00:45:43.800 align:start position:0%
has a fatal fetal diagnosis
 
00:45:47.150 --> 00:45:47.160 align:start position:0%
that is who it will truly affect
 
00:45:49.370 --> 00:45:49.380 align:start position:0%
I do not see this as an abortion bill I
 
00:45:51.530 --> 00:45:51.540 align:start position:0%
see this as a bill that will
 
00:45:54.109 --> 00:45:54.119 align:start position:0%
harm families who as I said are in a
 
00:45:57.710 --> 00:45:57.720 align:start position:0%
situation that any of us who can had
 
00:45:59.569 --> 00:45:59.579 align:start position:0%
nightmares about and were so fortunate
 
00:46:02.089 --> 00:46:02.099 align:start position:0%
not to have to endure so that's that's
 
00:46:03.950 --> 00:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
how I see this bill is that it affects
 
00:46:05.210 --> 00:46:05.220 align:start position:0%
those families I do not see this as
 
00:46:06.829 --> 00:46:06.839 align:start position:0%
being about abortion
 
00:46:08.809 --> 00:46:08.819 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:46:12.109 --> 00:46:12.119 align:start position:0%
other questions for this witness yes I
 
00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
do have one I I mean I I understand what
 
00:46:18.410 --> 00:46:18.420 align:start position:0%
you're sort of positing the situation
 
00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:20.089 align:start position:0%
you're sort of positing the situation
of

00:46:20.089 --> 00:46:20.099 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:46:23.210 --> 00:46:23.220 align:start position:0%
a couple or a woman who who doesn't
 
00:46:25.250 --> 00:46:25.260 align:start position:0%
really want to have an abortion and the
 
00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:46:28.130 --> 00:46:28.140 align:start position:0%
um there's a there's some kind of a
 
00:46:30.230 --> 00:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
fatal fetal abnormality and when the
 
00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
woman you know with a couple wants to be
 
00:46:35.870 --> 00:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
able to have time to comfort and sort of
 
00:46:38.329 --> 00:46:38.339 align:start position:0%
grieve as opposed to trying you know
 
00:46:40.670 --> 00:46:40.680 align:start position:0%
perhaps hopelessly maybe a lot maybe
 
00:46:43.609 --> 00:46:43.619 align:start position:0%
most of them yeah but I guess what the
 
00:46:44.809 --> 00:46:44.819 align:start position:0%
thing I'm not
 
00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
sure your addressing is what about the
 
00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
situation of the woman who wants to have
 
00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
an abortion she does not want this child
 
00:46:57.290 --> 00:46:57.300 align:start position:0%
and at 23 weeks an abortion is attempted
 
00:47:00.410 --> 00:47:00.420 align:start position:0%
and the the you know for some reason
 
00:47:03.290 --> 00:47:03.300 align:start position:0%
that attempt fails so the child is now
 
00:47:06.770 --> 00:47:06.780 align:start position:0%
born alive and that person is not saying
 
00:47:09.410 --> 00:47:09.420 align:start position:0%
to the doctors I want to grieve with
 
00:47:12.650 --> 00:47:12.660 align:start position:0%
this child I want to you know I I what
 
00:47:15.829 --> 00:47:15.839 align:start position:0%
that person is saying is I had a legal
 
00:47:18.109 --> 00:47:18.119 align:start position:0%
right to abortion at 23 weeks and I
 
00:47:20.569 --> 00:47:20.579 align:start position:0%
asked you to provide to do it and you
 
00:47:22.849 --> 00:47:22.859 align:start position:0%
failed I don't want this child now what
 
00:47:25.329 --> 00:47:25.339 align:start position:0%
does the doctor do in that situation
 
00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:27.240 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
a very theoretical situation
 
00:47:32.450 --> 00:47:32.460 align:start position:0%
and these are real cases that I'm
 
00:47:35.089 --> 00:47:35.099 align:start position:0%
familiar with I am not an abortion
 
00:47:35.099 --> 00:47:36.710 align:start position:0%
familiar with I am not an abortion
provider

00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
provider
 
00:47:39.109 --> 00:47:39.119 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:47:41.690 --> 00:47:41.700 align:start position:0%
has real harm and I don't know that that
 
00:47:44.210 --> 00:47:44.220 align:start position:0%
would be a real benefit
 
00:47:47.450 --> 00:47:47.460 align:start position:0%
other questions for this week
 
00:47:49.370 --> 00:47:49.380 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you
 
00:47:52.130 --> 00:47:52.140 align:start position:0%
next I'm going to call on Nancy Glenn
 
00:47:54.410 --> 00:47:54.420 align:start position:0%
and the next witness after that will be
 
00:47:57.530 --> 00:47:57.540 align:start position:0%
Devin chafee
 
00:47:59.630 --> 00:47:59.640 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and members of the
 
00:48:01.370 --> 00:48:01.380 align:start position:0%
House Judiciary Committee for hearing my
 
00:48:04.069 --> 00:48:04.079 align:start position:0%
story my name is Nancy Glenn and I live
 
00:48:08.089 --> 00:48:08.099 align:start position:0%
in Sutton New Hampshire I oppose HB 346
 
00:48:10.190 --> 00:48:10.200 align:start position:0%
and I hope that you will all take my
 
00:48:13.130 --> 00:48:13.140 align:start position:0%
personal experience into consideration
 
00:48:16.010 --> 00:48:16.020 align:start position:0%
we go back seven years ago in June of
 
00:48:18.890 --> 00:48:18.900 align:start position:0%
2015. I was in the hospital because of
 
00:48:21.349 --> 00:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
complications in my pregnancy and I was
 
00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:23.940 align:start position:0%
being prepped for an emergency C-section
 
00:48:25.730 --> 00:48:25.740 align:start position:0%
I am brought into the operating room
 
00:48:28.670 --> 00:48:28.680 align:start position:0%
with my husband by my side alongside us
 
00:48:31.130 --> 00:48:31.140 align:start position:0%
were three nurses
 
00:48:33.770 --> 00:48:33.780 align:start position:0%
as well as in Maternal Fetal Medicine
 
00:48:36.670 --> 00:48:36.680 align:start position:0%
doctor four nurses for the NICU two
 
00:48:39.589 --> 00:48:39.599 align:start position:0%
anesthesiologists one OB GYN a
 
00:48:41.450 --> 00:48:41.460 align:start position:0%
neonatologist from the NICU and then
 
00:48:42.770 --> 00:48:42.780 align:start position:0%
there are two more people that were
 
00:48:44.809 --> 00:48:44.819 align:start position:0%
there as well that I wasn't exactly sure
 
00:48:46.550 --> 00:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
what their role was
 
00:48:48.530 --> 00:48:48.540 align:start position:0%
if you add all of those people together
 
00:48:51.710 --> 00:48:51.720 align:start position:0%
you get 14 people not counting my
 
00:48:53.089 --> 00:48:53.099 align:start position:0%
husband and I
 
00:48:55.010 --> 00:48:55.020 align:start position:0%
it was a crowded space and it was an
 
00:48:57.050 --> 00:48:57.060 align:start position:0%
extremely serious situation
 
00:48:59.329 --> 00:48:59.339 align:start position:0%
C-sections are quick and within a half
 
00:49:02.329 --> 00:49:02.339 align:start position:0%
hour my beautiful son Sawyer was born
 
00:49:04.069 --> 00:49:04.079 align:start position:0%
the nurses and doctors immediately
 
00:49:05.690 --> 00:49:05.700 align:start position:0%
started to work on him
 
00:49:07.970 --> 00:49:07.980 align:start position:0%
he was having trouble breathing and they
 
00:49:09.230 --> 00:49:09.240 align:start position:0%
were checking all of his other vital
 
00:49:12.530 --> 00:49:12.540 align:start position:0%
signs about an hour later there was
 
00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
still a struggle to keep sort of
 
00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:15.109 align:start position:0%
still a struggle to keep sort of
incubated

00:49:15.109 --> 00:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
incubated
 
00:49:18.770 --> 00:49:18.780 align:start position:0%
he was so tiny he only weighs 11.6
 
00:49:20.690 --> 00:49:20.700 align:start position:0%
ounces when he was born
 
00:49:22.910 --> 00:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
the nurses and doctors continued and the
 
00:49:24.650 --> 00:49:24.660 align:start position:0%
neonatologist came to me and my husband
 
00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
and said
 
00:49:28.849 --> 00:49:28.859 align:start position:0%
we can't keep the tube in
 
00:49:31.010 --> 00:49:31.020 align:start position:0%
I start screaming at the doctor asking
 
00:49:33.950 --> 00:49:33.960 align:start position:0%
him what do we do now
 
00:49:36.430 --> 00:49:36.440 align:start position:0%
I had a son that was also born premature
 
00:49:39.050 --> 00:49:39.060 align:start position:0%
earlier his older brother Hunter who's
 
00:49:40.370 --> 00:49:40.380 align:start position:0%
now 11.
 
00:49:44.329 --> 00:49:44.339 align:start position:0%
and I kind of had a general idea of them
 
00:49:45.829 --> 00:49:45.839 align:start position:0%
being able to do some of these medical
 
00:49:48.109 --> 00:49:48.119 align:start position:0%
procedures to be able to help support
 
00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
the baby
 
00:49:52.309 --> 00:49:52.319 align:start position:0%
my emotions were an all-time high and
 
00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
the doctor froze and wasn't sure how to
 
00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:55.250 align:start position:0%
the doctor froze and wasn't sure how to
respond

00:49:55.250 --> 00:49:55.260 align:start position:0%
respond
 
00:49:57.349 --> 00:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
my husband recognized what the doctor
 
00:49:59.809 --> 00:49:59.819 align:start position:0%
was trying to say and he very calmly
 
00:50:02.990 --> 00:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
asked give us our son keep him
 
00:50:06.410 --> 00:50:06.420 align:start position:0%
comfortable give us our son
 
00:50:08.150 --> 00:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
the doctor and the other providers
 
00:50:10.130 --> 00:50:10.140 align:start position:0%
understood and they respected our ask
 
00:50:12.770 --> 00:50:12.780 align:start position:0%
and they brought Sawyer to us it was the
 
00:50:15.170 --> 00:50:15.180 align:start position:0%
first time I got to see him
 
00:50:17.329 --> 00:50:17.339 align:start position:0%
Sawyer was then placed on my chest with
 
00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
my husband's arms wrapped around him
 
00:50:21.950 --> 00:50:21.960 align:start position:0%
he was so beautiful
 
00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
we spent every last moment together as a
 
00:50:26.809 --> 00:50:26.819 align:start position:0%
family we spent the time memorizing his
 
00:50:29.210 --> 00:50:29.220 align:start position:0%
face telling him how much we loved him
 
00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
if I closed my eyes and if I listened
 
00:50:34.970 --> 00:50:34.980 align:start position:0%
really close I can still hear those
 
00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
little sweet sweet breasts and the sound
 
00:50:39.349 --> 00:50:39.359 align:start position:0%
of them are still right there in my
 
00:50:39.359 --> 00:50:40.910 align:start position:0%
of them are still right there in my
brain

00:50:40.910 --> 00:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
brain
 
00:50:43.550 --> 00:50:43.560 align:start position:0%
I kissed him on the forehead and then he
 
00:50:44.930 --> 00:50:44.940 align:start position:0%
was gone
 
00:50:47.450 --> 00:50:47.460 align:start position:0%
those myths with him are the only memory
 
00:50:50.210 --> 00:50:50.220 align:start position:0%
I have of him and I cannot begin to
 
00:50:52.010 --> 00:50:52.020 align:start position:0%
describe to you what those moments have
 
00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:55.020 align:start position:0%
done for my emotional and mental healing
 
00:50:57.829 --> 00:50:57.839 align:start position:0%
especially as a mom I was also on
 
00:50:59.750 --> 00:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
Medicaid for my pregnancy and I lost
 
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
coverage before I could get any proper
 
00:51:03.349 --> 00:51:03.359 align:start position:0%
grief counseling
 
00:51:05.150 --> 00:51:05.160 align:start position:0%
I am forever grateful that the medical
 
00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
providers listen to me and my husband
 
00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:09.480 align:start position:0%
and ensured that we had that time to
 
00:51:11.690 --> 00:51:11.700 align:start position:0%
spend with Sawyer and make that sweet
 
00:51:13.790 --> 00:51:13.800 align:start position:0%
memory that helps me get through every
 
00:51:15.530 --> 00:51:15.540 align:start position:0%
single day
 
00:51:18.049 --> 00:51:18.059 align:start position:0%
a wise Pastor once told me that the
 
00:51:20.030 --> 00:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
greatest pain one could ever experience
 
00:51:22.069 --> 00:51:22.079 align:start position:0%
is the loss of a child
 
00:51:24.170 --> 00:51:24.180 align:start position:0%
that losing a child takes you to the
 
00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
deepest darkest pits of hell and you
 
00:51:28.130 --> 00:51:28.140 align:start position:0%
either come back stronger and more
 
00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
Fierce than ever or you say in those
 
00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:33.240 align:start position:0%
deep dark pits and allow it to consume
 
00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:34.069 align:start position:0%
deep dark pits and allow it to consume
you

00:51:34.069 --> 00:51:34.079 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:51:36.829 --> 00:51:36.839 align:start position:0%
I know that the memories that I was able
 
00:51:38.990 --> 00:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
to have with Sawyer ultimately have made
 
00:51:42.589 --> 00:51:42.599 align:start position:0%
me stronger and more fierce
 
00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:45.480 align:start position:0%
strong and fierce to care for his older
 
00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
brother Hunter
 
00:51:49.609 --> 00:51:49.619 align:start position:0%
who also has a disability
 
00:51:51.230 --> 00:51:51.240 align:start position:0%
strong and fierce enough to be an active
 
00:51:52.970 --> 00:51:52.980 align:start position:0%
member of my community
 
00:51:55.130 --> 00:51:55.140 align:start position:0%
strong and fierce enough to share this
 
00:51:57.890 --> 00:51:57.900 align:start position:0%
story with you all today a story that
 
00:52:00.829 --> 00:52:00.839 align:start position:0%
exposes my vulnerability and reopens the
 
00:52:02.809 --> 00:52:02.819 align:start position:0%
Eternal wound of the missing piece of my
 
00:52:05.089 --> 00:52:05.099 align:start position:0%
family every single time I have to tell
 
00:52:05.099 --> 00:52:05.870 align:start position:0%
family every single time I have to tell
it

00:52:05.870 --> 00:52:05.880 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:52:07.970 --> 00:52:07.980 align:start position:0%
but I continue to do so in hopes that
 
00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:09.720 align:start position:0%
other families who experience this
 
00:52:12.170 --> 00:52:12.180 align:start position:0%
tremendous loss have a chance to hold
 
00:52:14.809 --> 00:52:14.819 align:start position:0%
their loved one as they pass
 
00:52:16.250 --> 00:52:16.260 align:start position:0%
I share in hopes that the medical
 
00:52:18.410 --> 00:52:18.420 align:start position:0%
professionals who are trained to do no
 
00:52:21.049 --> 00:52:21.059 align:start position:0%
harm will not face charges because they
 
00:52:22.970 --> 00:52:22.980 align:start position:0%
recognize how important these last few
 
00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
moments are
 
00:52:28.790 --> 00:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
I strongly urge you to oppose HB 346 and
 
00:52:31.069 --> 00:52:31.079 align:start position:0%
to see for what it truly is
 
00:52:33.770 --> 00:52:33.780 align:start position:0%
to reference I did walk in earlier and I
 
00:52:36.650 --> 00:52:36.660 align:start position:0%
did hear that the intent of this bill is
 
00:52:38.329 --> 00:52:38.339 align:start position:0%
to not take this right away
 
00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
from families like mine that that's the
 
00:52:44.030 --> 00:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
intent but the way it is written it will
 
00:52:47.089 --> 00:52:47.099 align:start position:0%
and it will cause harm to families
 
00:52:49.849 --> 00:52:49.859 align:start position:0%
I am one of many who has lost a child
 
00:52:52.309 --> 00:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
and will lose a child in the future
 
00:52:54.589 --> 00:52:54.599 align:start position:0%
every parent should have the opportunity
 
00:52:56.750 --> 00:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
to have those moments and make those
 
00:52:59.690 --> 00:52:59.700 align:start position:0%
memories with their baby so they too can
 
00:53:01.790 --> 00:53:01.800 align:start position:0%
be strong and fierce for their families
 
00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:05.400 align:start position:0%
their communities and themselves
 
00:53:07.790 --> 00:53:07.800 align:start position:0%
I thank you very much as legislators for
 
00:53:09.890 --> 00:53:09.900 align:start position:0%
everything that you all do thank you
 
00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:16.250 --> 00:53:16.260 align:start position:0%
yes representative Stapleton
 
00:53:19.370 --> 00:53:19.380 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I'm so
 
00:53:22.490 --> 00:53:22.500 align:start position:0%
very sorry for your most difficult life
 
00:53:22.500 --> 00:53:24.049 align:start position:0%
very sorry for your most difficult life
experience

00:53:24.049 --> 00:53:24.059 align:start position:0%
experience
 
00:53:27.710 --> 00:53:27.720 align:start position:0%
and um can appreciate the grief and the
 
00:53:30.410 --> 00:53:30.420 align:start position:0%
sorrow accompanying that
 
00:53:32.150 --> 00:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
but it sounds like from your testimony
 
00:53:36.049 --> 00:53:36.059 align:start position:0%
did I hear you say 14 in attendance of a
 
00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
number of medical people doctors and
 
00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:39.290 align:start position:0%
number of medical people doctors and
nurses

00:53:39.290 --> 00:53:39.300 align:start position:0%
nurses
 
00:53:42.049 --> 00:53:42.059 align:start position:0%
it sounds like they were trying to do
 
00:53:44.930 --> 00:53:44.940 align:start position:0%
everything they possibly could to save
 
00:53:47.569 --> 00:53:47.579 align:start position:0%
the life of your son
 
00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
that would wouldn't that be different
 
00:53:54.650 --> 00:53:54.660 align:start position:0%
from someone who gave up and just
 
00:53:54.660 --> 00:53:56.150 align:start position:0%
from someone who gave up and just
ordered

00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
ordered
 
00:53:59.150 --> 00:53:59.160 align:start position:0%
the baby terminated you didn't do that
 
00:54:01.849 --> 00:54:01.859 align:start position:0%
the doctors didn't do that you all were
 
00:54:03.589 --> 00:54:03.599 align:start position:0%
trying to make the best out of a
 
00:54:05.870 --> 00:54:05.880 align:start position:0%
difficult situation that's a lot
 
00:54:07.790 --> 00:54:07.800 align:start position:0%
different from what this bill is talking
 
00:54:09.829 --> 00:54:09.839 align:start position:0%
about isn't it
 
00:54:12.109 --> 00:54:12.119 align:start position:0%
unfortunately representative the way it
 
00:54:16.010 --> 00:54:16.020 align:start position:0%
is written it is not is too vague
 
00:54:17.870 --> 00:54:17.880 align:start position:0%
I have I have read the bill I have
 
00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
looked at it I also do work in
 
00:54:22.609 --> 00:54:22.619 align:start position:0%
organizing and policy change I have
 
00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
looked at it and the way that is written
 
00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:26.640 align:start position:0%
because of the way it's written and how
 
00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
vague it is it does leave out the pain
 
00:54:32.270 --> 00:54:32.280 align:start position:0%
and suffering of families like mine
 
00:54:35.450 --> 00:54:35.460 align:start position:0%
so I would say that I understand that
 
00:54:38.530 --> 00:54:38.540 align:start position:0%
you all are pointing to this as being an
 
00:54:41.329 --> 00:54:41.339 align:start position:0%
abortion Bill something that is related
 
00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
to that but I can tell you that it is
 
00:54:46.250 --> 00:54:46.260 align:start position:0%
poorly written if that is what is is
 
00:54:49.069 --> 00:54:49.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:52.670 --> 00:54:52.680 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions for this week
 
00:54:54.829 --> 00:54:54.839 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you very much I'm
 
00:54:57.770 --> 00:54:57.780 align:start position:0%
going to call on Devin chafee uh next
 
00:54:59.569 --> 00:54:59.579 align:start position:0%
and then that and the witness after that
 
00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:10.730 --> 00:55:10.740 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Lynn and other
 
00:55:12.589 --> 00:55:12.599 align:start position:0%
honorable members of this committee for
 
00:55:14.569 --> 00:55:14.579 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Devin chafee and
 
00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
I'm the executive director of the ACLU
 
00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and I am here today to
 
00:55:22.010 --> 00:55:22.020 align:start position:0%
urge you to vote in expedient to
 
00:55:25.490 --> 00:55:25.500 align:start position:0%
legislate on HB 364.
 
00:55:28.069 --> 00:55:28.079 align:start position:0%
I want to start by saying that I really
 
00:55:30.650 --> 00:55:30.660 align:start position:0%
greatly appreciate the opportunity to be
 
00:55:33.109 --> 00:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
before you today and to engage you on
 
00:55:35.450 --> 00:55:35.460 align:start position:0%
this issue because I think it is just so
 
00:55:38.569 --> 00:55:38.579 align:start position:0%
important that the conversation that we
 
00:55:41.569 --> 00:55:41.579 align:start position:0%
are having here today be rooted in the
 
00:55:41.579 --> 00:55:42.890 align:start position:0%
are having here today be rooted in the
reality

00:55:42.890 --> 00:55:42.900 align:start position:0%
reality
 
00:55:46.730 --> 00:55:46.740 align:start position:0%
not hypotheticals but in the reality of
 
00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
the impossible difficult medical
 
00:55:51.470 --> 00:55:51.480 align:start position:0%
decisions that parents and families have
 
00:55:53.630 --> 00:55:53.640 align:start position:0%
to make in consultation with their
 
00:55:56.510 --> 00:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
medical providers
 
00:55:58.670 --> 00:55:58.680 align:start position:0%
you have already heard some stories here
 
00:56:00.589 --> 00:56:00.599 align:start position:0%
today and I know you will hear more
 
00:56:02.930 --> 00:56:02.940 align:start position:0%
about this reality and I know that many
 
00:56:05.690 --> 00:56:05.700 align:start position:0%
of us many of us have either personally
 
00:56:07.849 --> 00:56:07.859 align:start position:0%
experienced or we know someone who
 
00:56:10.250 --> 00:56:10.260 align:start position:0%
personally has experienced
 
00:56:12.470 --> 00:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
very difficult circumstances in
 
00:56:15.049 --> 00:56:15.059 align:start position:0%
pregnancy such as a extremely early
 
00:56:18.410 --> 00:56:18.420 align:start position:0%
labor or fatal fetal diagnosis or even
 
00:56:20.089 --> 00:56:20.099 align:start position:0%
those who have experienced a high
 
00:56:24.049 --> 00:56:24.059 align:start position:0%
pregnancy a high sorry a high threat a
 
00:56:26.690 --> 00:56:26.700 align:start position:0%
High um risk pregnancy like I had with
 
00:56:28.670 --> 00:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
my twins where the threat of one of
 
00:56:30.770 --> 00:56:30.780 align:start position:0%
these horrible outcomes
 
00:56:33.530 --> 00:56:33.540 align:start position:0%
is very very present in the minds of
 
00:56:36.410 --> 00:56:36.420 align:start position:0%
expecting parents and I know that all of
 
00:56:38.870 --> 00:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
us have compassion for the parents and
 
00:56:40.730 --> 00:56:40.740 align:start position:0%
families who are in these situations and
 
00:56:43.130 --> 00:56:43.140 align:start position:0%
for the difficult situations that they
 
00:56:44.750 --> 00:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
are in and the decisions that they have
 
00:56:46.490 --> 00:56:46.500 align:start position:0%
to make with their doctors
 
00:56:50.450 --> 00:56:50.460 align:start position:0%
no one wants to be in this position
 
00:56:52.430 --> 00:56:52.440 align:start position:0%
and the bottom line is that regardless
 
00:56:56.210 --> 00:56:56.220 align:start position:0%
of the intent of this bill HB 346
 
00:56:58.970 --> 00:56:58.980 align:start position:0%
impacts such impossible decisions where
 
00:57:01.250 --> 00:57:01.260 align:start position:0%
an infant has only hours or days to live
 
00:57:03.470 --> 00:57:03.480 align:start position:0%
and a family must decide how to spend
 
00:57:04.790 --> 00:57:04.800 align:start position:0%
the little time they have left with
 
00:57:06.049 --> 00:57:06.059 align:start position:0%
their child
 
00:57:08.329 --> 00:57:08.339 align:start position:0%
it could deny parents the ability to
 
00:57:09.950 --> 00:57:09.960 align:start position:0%
choose the type of Compassionate Care
 
00:57:12.170 --> 00:57:12.180 align:start position:0%
that works for their family and their
 
00:57:15.230 --> 00:57:15.240 align:start position:0%
faith in these situations and it would
 
00:57:17.030 --> 00:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
allow them as we would allow them to do
 
00:57:19.790 --> 00:57:19.800 align:start position:0%
at any other point right in a child's
 
00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:21.349 align:start position:0%
at any other point right in a child's
life

00:57:21.349 --> 00:57:21.359 align:start position:0%
life
 
00:57:24.049 --> 00:57:24.059 align:start position:0%
anybody who has had to make the
 
00:57:27.049 --> 00:57:27.059 align:start position:0%
impossible decision to take a loved one
 
00:57:29.410 --> 00:57:29.420 align:start position:0%
off of life support
 
00:57:32.390 --> 00:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
understands the excruciating pain of
 
00:57:34.970 --> 00:57:34.980 align:start position:0%
these decisions understands that these
 
00:57:38.450 --> 00:57:38.460 align:start position:0%
types of decisions are not one size fits
 
00:57:38.460 --> 00:57:39.650 align:start position:0%
types of decisions are not one size fits
all

00:57:39.650 --> 00:57:39.660 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:57:41.930 --> 00:57:41.940 align:start position:0%
and if a child were dying at the age of
 
00:57:44.510 --> 00:57:44.520 align:start position:0%
one or five or even six months we would
 
00:57:46.069 --> 00:57:46.079 align:start position:0%
entirely trust the parents in
 
00:57:48.290 --> 00:57:48.300 align:start position:0%
consultation with their doctors to make
 
00:57:49.970 --> 00:57:49.980 align:start position:0%
the best decision regarding
 
00:57:52.430 --> 00:57:52.440 align:start position:0%
Compassionate Care for their child
 
00:57:55.730 --> 00:57:55.740 align:start position:0%
but HB 346 adds restrictions on the
 
00:57:57.710 --> 00:57:57.720 align:start position:0%
adopter's ability to provide a standard
 
00:57:59.930 --> 00:57:59.940 align:start position:0%
of care according to the parents wishes
 
00:58:02.329 --> 00:58:02.339 align:start position:0%
for newborns under the threat of a class
 
00:58:05.210 --> 00:58:05.220 align:start position:0%
a felony
 
00:58:07.549 --> 00:58:07.559 align:start position:0%
if this be if this bill becomes law
 
00:58:09.170 --> 00:58:09.180 align:start position:0%
doctors will be forced to administer
 
00:58:11.390 --> 00:58:11.400 align:start position:0%
futile and painful treatment to extend
 
00:58:13.430 --> 00:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
the life of an infant for just minutes
 
00:58:15.470 --> 00:58:15.480 align:start position:0%
or hours against the wishes of the
 
00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:16.670 align:start position:0%
or hours against the wishes of the
parents

00:58:16.670 --> 00:58:16.680 align:start position:0%
parents
 
00:58:19.490 --> 00:58:19.500 align:start position:0%
the bill explicitly requires doctors to
 
00:58:22.010 --> 00:58:22.020 align:start position:0%
apply Medical Care to quote preserve the
 
00:58:24.109 --> 00:58:24.119 align:start position:0%
life and health of the born alive infant
 
00:58:24.119 --> 00:58:26.210 align:start position:0%
life and health of the born alive infant

00:58:28.130 --> 00:58:28.140 align:start position:0%
now we know that there are and will be
 
00:58:29.809 --> 00:58:29.819 align:start position:0%
cases where medical procedures could
 
00:58:32.329 --> 00:58:32.339 align:start position:0%
give an infant a few minutes or an extra
 
00:58:35.210 --> 00:58:35.220 align:start position:0%
hour or a day to live but it would take
 
00:58:36.770 --> 00:58:36.780 align:start position:0%
the infant out of the arms of its
 
00:58:38.930 --> 00:58:38.940 align:start position:0%
families and cause more pain and grief
 
00:58:41.809 --> 00:58:41.819 align:start position:0%
and I know you have heard today
 
00:58:44.450 --> 00:58:44.460 align:start position:0%
testimony that begs this question as to
 
00:58:46.010 --> 00:58:46.020 align:start position:0%
whether or not this bill is in fact
 
00:58:49.490 --> 00:58:49.500 align:start position:0%
necessary to prevent infanticide
 
00:58:51.710 --> 00:58:51.720 align:start position:0%
or to make sure that babies are not born
 
00:58:55.190 --> 00:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
alive and then somehow left to die
 
00:58:58.010 --> 00:58:58.020 align:start position:0%
but the answer to that question is quite
 
00:59:00.170 --> 00:59:00.180 align:start position:0%
simply no
 
00:59:02.329 --> 00:59:02.339 align:start position:0%
of course not
 
00:59:04.930 --> 00:59:04.940 align:start position:0%
of course not it is not necessary
 
00:59:07.069 --> 00:59:07.079 align:start position:0%
infanticide is already illegal under
 
00:59:10.370 --> 00:59:10.380 align:start position:0%
state and federal law harming anyone
 
00:59:13.849 --> 00:59:13.859 align:start position:0%
including a newborn is illegal
 
00:59:16.250 --> 00:59:16.260 align:start position:0%
quite frankly to suggest otherwise it's
 
00:59:18.349 --> 00:59:18.359 align:start position:0%
inflammatory and it is insulting to
 
00:59:20.569 --> 00:59:20.579 align:start position:0%
Medical providers some of whom are here
 
00:59:22.549 --> 00:59:22.559 align:start position:0%
today and who are working so hard to
 
00:59:24.950 --> 00:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
provide quality care to their patients
 
00:59:27.770 --> 00:59:27.780 align:start position:0%
no one is killing infants with impunity
 
00:59:31.970 --> 00:59:31.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:34.430 --> 00:59:34.440 align:start position:0%
now there was one example that was given
 
00:59:37.250 --> 00:59:37.260 align:start position:0%
here today by a previous individual who
 
00:59:39.650 --> 00:59:39.660 align:start position:0%
testified talking about Kermit Gosnell
 
00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
who ran a horrible criminal Enterprise
 
00:59:43.549 --> 00:59:43.559 align:start position:0%
in Philadelphia
 
00:59:45.589 --> 00:59:45.599 align:start position:0%
and we can all agree that it is correct
 
00:59:47.809 --> 00:59:47.819 align:start position:0%
that he is serving a life sentence in
 
00:59:50.809 --> 00:59:50.819 align:start position:0%
prison for murder as he should be
 
00:59:53.030 --> 00:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
no one's debating that there are
 
00:59:55.490 --> 00:59:55.500 align:start position:0%
existing laws that prohibit infanticide
 
00:59:57.770 --> 00:59:57.780 align:start position:0%
and other types of murder and the jury
 
00:59:59.450 --> 00:59:59.460 align:start position:0%
that punished him for his appalling
 
01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to end by simply saying
 
01:00:09.829 --> 01:00:09.839 align:start position:0%
that there is an issue there is a reason
 
01:00:11.690 --> 01:00:11.700 align:start position:0%
why when this issue goes to voters
 
01:00:13.970 --> 01:00:13.980 align:start position:0%
actually goes to the people as it did in
 
01:00:16.730 --> 01:00:16.740 align:start position:0%
Montana last November voters defeat
 
01:00:18.770 --> 01:00:18.780 align:start position:0%
these types of measures
 
01:00:21.770 --> 01:00:21.780 align:start position:0%
HB 346 would harm families already
 
01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
struggling in tragic situations
 
01:00:26.510 --> 01:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
and I want to just point out that the
 
01:00:28.130 --> 01:00:28.140 align:start position:0%
supporters of this provision you cannot
 
01:00:30.890 --> 01:00:30.900 align:start position:0%
have it both ways either this bill goes
 
01:00:32.809 --> 01:00:32.819 align:start position:0%
further than existing laws and does
 
01:00:35.210 --> 01:00:35.220 align:start position:0%
actually have restrictions on doctors
 
01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
providers and parents
 
01:00:39.770 --> 01:00:39.780 align:start position:0%
or it simply codifies existing prohibit
 
01:00:42.650 --> 01:00:42.660 align:start position:0%
prohibitions on infanticide in which
 
01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
case it's unnecessary because those
 
01:00:46.130 --> 01:00:46.140 align:start position:0%
things are already prohibited under
 
01:00:48.530 --> 01:00:48.540 align:start position:0%
federal and state law and are already
 
01:00:51.289 --> 01:00:51.299 align:start position:0%
being enforced
 
01:00:53.569 --> 01:00:53.579 align:start position:0%
and I'll just end by saying
 
01:00:56.270 --> 01:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
we all know how hard end of life
 
01:00:59.450 --> 01:00:59.460 align:start position:0%
decisions are please do not make these
 
01:01:01.370 --> 01:01:01.380 align:start position:0%
Private health care decisions that
 
01:01:02.809 --> 01:01:02.819 align:start position:0%
should be between a family and their
 
01:01:05.630 --> 01:01:05.640 align:start position:0%
provider even more difficult
 
01:01:07.609 --> 01:01:07.619 align:start position:0%
for these reasons I respectfully urge
 
01:01:09.349 --> 01:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
the members of this committee to vote in
 
01:01:12.530 --> 01:01:12.540 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate on HB 346 thank
 
01:01:17.210 --> 01:01:17.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
representative Staples
 
01:01:23.170 --> 01:01:23.180 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
that was a very moving argument that you
 
01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:28.430 align:start position:0%
that was a very moving argument that you
make

01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:28.440 align:start position:0%
make
 
01:01:31.970 --> 01:01:31.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:36.530 --> 01:01:36.540 align:start position:0%
on page two line nine
 
01:01:41.329 --> 01:01:41.339 align:start position:0%
the health care provider is the one
 
01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
on the hook for this if some if if
 
01:01:46.730 --> 01:01:46.740 align:start position:0%
there's a violation of law
 
01:01:49.010 --> 01:01:49.020 align:start position:0%
but he must have the intention of
 
01:01:54.109 --> 01:01:54.119 align:start position:0%
causing or hastening the infant's death
 
01:01:56.089 --> 01:01:56.099 align:start position:0%
now in some of the testimonies we've
 
01:01:57.770 --> 01:01:57.780 align:start position:0%
heard here
 
01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
we see medical people striving to
 
01:02:02.210 --> 01:02:02.220 align:start position:0%
preserve the life
 
01:02:05.630 --> 01:02:05.640 align:start position:0%
of the child born even if there are
 
01:02:09.470 --> 01:02:09.480 align:start position:0%
fetal anomalies and abnormalities
 
01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
isn't that a lot different than an
 
01:02:15.349 --> 01:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
intentional causing or hastening of an
 
01:02:18.230 --> 01:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
infant's death to terminate its life
 
01:02:20.809 --> 01:02:20.819 align:start position:0%
on a request and even
 
01:02:24.170 --> 01:02:24.180 align:start position:0%
but we do distinctly draw the difference
 
01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:27.420 align:start position:0%
and this is not a case-by-case example
 
01:02:30.950 --> 01:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
or exception but rather addressing the
 
01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:32.089 align:start position:0%
or exception but rather addressing the
problem

01:02:32.089 --> 01:02:32.099 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:02:35.089 --> 01:02:35.099 align:start position:0%
of a bad actor or a bad action
 
01:02:37.970 --> 01:02:37.980 align:start position:0%
to terminate the life
 
01:02:40.910 --> 01:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
of that child whether it's a normal life
 
01:02:44.349 --> 01:02:44.359 align:start position:0%
or even if it's a fetally
 
01:02:46.970 --> 01:02:46.980 align:start position:0%
abnormal uh
 
01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:49.430 align:start position:0%
abnormal uh
anomaly

01:02:49.430 --> 01:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
anomaly
 
01:02:53.510 --> 01:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
um we're talking about the intentional
 
01:02:57.289 --> 01:02:57.299 align:start position:0%
causing or hastening of that death
 
01:02:59.270 --> 01:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
there's a distinct difference is there
 
01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:00.109 align:start position:0%
there's a distinct difference is there
not

01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:00.119 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:03:02.150 --> 01:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Stapleton for
 
01:03:03.710 --> 01:03:03.720 align:start position:0%
that question I guess where I'm getting
 
01:03:06.410 --> 01:03:06.420 align:start position:0%
confused is the killing of an infant
 
01:03:09.349 --> 01:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
infanticide murder is already illegal
 
01:03:11.630 --> 01:03:11.640 align:start position:0%
under New Hampshire and federal law and
 
01:03:14.210 --> 01:03:14.220 align:start position:0%
and I'm not at all clear as to what
 
01:03:16.130 --> 01:03:16.140 align:start position:0%
these circumstances are that are
 
01:03:18.589 --> 01:03:18.599 align:start position:0%
actually happening in reality where
 
01:03:20.809 --> 01:03:20.819 align:start position:0%
infants are being killed but somehow are
 
01:03:22.789 --> 01:03:22.799 align:start position:0%
not covered by existing law that
 
01:03:25.250 --> 01:03:25.260 align:start position:0%
prohibits and fantasize and so that this
 
01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
is where I don't understand and this is
 
01:03:28.789 --> 01:03:28.799 align:start position:0%
where I am concerned that we are talking
 
01:03:31.370 --> 01:03:31.380 align:start position:0%
about hypotheticals instead of really
 
01:03:33.470 --> 01:03:33.480 align:start position:0%
considering the reality of the
 
01:03:35.030 --> 01:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
individuals and the families in these
 
01:03:37.190 --> 01:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
difficult circumstances and how this law
 
01:03:39.710 --> 01:03:39.720 align:start position:0%
might impact them I also want to say
 
01:03:42.589 --> 01:03:42.599 align:start position:0%
that that by targeting Physicians so
 
01:03:44.870 --> 01:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
clearly in this legislation not just
 
01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
Physicians but really any Hospital
 
01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:48.650 align:start position:0%
Physicians but really any Hospital
employee

01:03:48.650 --> 01:03:48.660 align:start position:0%
employee
 
01:03:51.289 --> 01:03:51.299 align:start position:0%
with a class a felony for providing the
 
01:03:53.690 --> 01:03:53.700 align:start position:0%
care that they see as most fit
 
01:03:55.490 --> 01:03:55.500 align:start position:0%
we're potentially setting up medical
 
01:03:57.650 --> 01:03:57.660 align:start position:0%
providers against one another
 
01:04:00.109 --> 01:04:00.119 align:start position:0%
and really encouraging them it's not
 
01:04:01.970 --> 01:04:01.980 align:start position:0%
requiring and forcing them to provide
 
01:04:04.490 --> 01:04:04.500 align:start position:0%
treatment that could be futile and I
 
01:04:06.770 --> 01:04:06.780 align:start position:0%
think we have heard extensive testimony
 
01:04:08.809 --> 01:04:08.819 align:start position:0%
already here today about the potential
 
01:04:10.670 --> 01:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
negative effects that that could have on
 
01:04:12.349 --> 01:04:12.359 align:start position:0%
real families who are really
 
01:04:16.309 --> 01:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
experiencing these um these horrific
 
01:04:18.890 --> 01:04:18.900 align:start position:0%
circumstances in their lives
 
01:04:22.549 --> 01:04:22.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:24.589 --> 01:04:24.599 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
01:04:24.599 --> 01:04:36.289 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
you

01:04:36.289 --> 01:04:36.299 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:38.450 --> 01:04:38.460 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry so um
 
01:04:42.710 --> 01:04:42.720 align:start position:0%
next uh we have uh
 
01:04:45.289 --> 01:04:45.299 align:start position:0%
Michael I'm not sure if it's Michael or
 
01:04:47.809 --> 01:04:47.819 align:start position:0%
Michelle uh Michelle Mike okay Michelle
 
01:04:49.190 --> 01:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
and next after that will be
 
01:04:52.370 --> 01:04:52.380 align:start position:0%
representative uh Matt Simons
 
01:05:01.370 --> 01:05:01.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:03.650 --> 01:05:03.660 align:start position:0%
good morning committee members uh thank
 
01:05:05.390 --> 01:05:05.400 align:start position:0%
you for hearing my testimony
 
01:05:07.609 --> 01:05:07.619 align:start position:0%
my name is Michael Michelle I am a
 
01:05:09.530 --> 01:05:09.540 align:start position:0%
resident of Dover and I'm speaking in
 
01:05:12.829 --> 01:05:12.839 align:start position:0%
opposition of HP 346.
 
01:05:15.530 --> 01:05:15.540 align:start position:0%
HP 346 could restrict options for
 
01:05:17.270 --> 01:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
families like mine who are grieving the
 
01:05:19.309 --> 01:05:19.319 align:start position:0%
loss of their child denied them the
 
01:05:21.710 --> 01:05:21.720 align:start position:0%
ability to choose Compassionate Care
 
01:05:24.049 --> 01:05:24.059 align:start position:0%
that's best for them
 
01:05:26.329 --> 01:05:26.339 align:start position:0%
I want to share one man's story give one
 
01:05:27.829 --> 01:05:27.839 align:start position:0%
man's perspective because I don't see
 
01:05:30.349 --> 01:05:30.359 align:start position:0%
men speaking out enough about this
 
01:05:32.690 --> 01:05:32.700 align:start position:0%
my wife and I divorced years after this
 
01:05:34.490 --> 01:05:34.500 align:start position:0%
happened so I'll not speak for her views
 
01:05:36.109 --> 01:05:36.119 align:start position:0%
today just about what happened to both
 
01:05:39.109 --> 01:05:39.119 align:start position:0%
of us just over 30 years ago now
 
01:05:41.150 --> 01:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
my wife and I were very excited we found
 
01:05:42.770 --> 01:05:42.780 align:start position:0%
out that she was pregnant we had no
 
01:05:44.930 --> 01:05:44.940 align:start position:0%
reason to be concerned so like most
 
01:05:46.609 --> 01:05:46.619 align:start position:0%
people in our situation we started
 
01:05:48.349 --> 01:05:48.359 align:start position:0%
planning and preparing
 
01:05:50.210 --> 01:05:50.220 align:start position:0%
she went for her checkups we began
 
01:05:51.650 --> 01:05:51.660 align:start position:0%
preparing the baby's room getting
 
01:05:54.289 --> 01:05:54.299 align:start position:0%
Furniture picking out names Etc
 
01:05:56.690 --> 01:05:56.700 align:start position:0%
later in the pregnancy we started
 
01:05:58.549 --> 01:05:58.559 align:start position:0%
pushing your OB for an ultrasound really
 
01:06:01.069 --> 01:06:01.079 align:start position:0%
just so we could find out the sex
 
01:06:03.230 --> 01:06:03.240 align:start position:0%
the ultrasound was done around 30 weeks
 
01:06:04.549 --> 01:06:04.559 align:start position:0%
or so when we got home from the
 
01:06:04.559 --> 01:06:05.450 align:start position:0%
or so when we got home from the
appointment

01:06:05.450 --> 01:06:05.460 align:start position:0%
appointment
 
01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
it was a phone message from her OB to
 
01:06:09.890 --> 01:06:09.900 align:start position:0%
call right away found out the baby had
 
01:06:12.289 --> 01:06:12.299 align:start position:0%
spina bifida their doctor had already
 
01:06:14.690 --> 01:06:14.700 align:start position:0%
set up an appointment for my wife
 
01:06:17.030 --> 01:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
this is on Friday and at that time there
 
01:06:19.309 --> 01:06:19.319 align:start position:0%
was very little information online
 
01:06:20.690 --> 01:06:20.700 align:start position:0%
so we spent the weekend at the local
 
01:06:23.690 --> 01:06:23.700 align:start position:0%
library researching spina bifida which
 
01:06:25.309 --> 01:06:25.319 align:start position:0%
was a condition with a spinal column
 
01:06:27.529 --> 01:06:27.539 align:start position:0%
doesn't form properly and as a result
 
01:06:29.809 --> 01:06:29.819 align:start position:0%
nerves don't connect properly to the
 
01:06:31.430 --> 01:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
rest of the body
 
01:06:33.109 --> 01:06:33.119 align:start position:0%
still trying to wrap our head around
 
01:06:35.210 --> 01:06:35.220 align:start position:0%
this news not life-threatening but
 
01:06:35.220 --> 01:06:36.230 align:start position:0%
this news not life-threatening but
serious

01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
serious
 
01:06:37.970 --> 01:06:37.980 align:start position:0%
we went to the ultrasound clinic on
 
01:06:40.849 --> 01:06:40.859 align:start position:0%
Monday the doctor spoke to us afterwards
 
01:06:42.349 --> 01:06:42.359 align:start position:0%
and told us that she could confirm the
 
01:06:43.910 --> 01:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
spina bifida
 
01:06:46.910 --> 01:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
but that was not really the big problem
 
01:06:48.170 --> 01:06:48.180 align:start position:0%
she went on to describe a heart
 
01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
condition tetralogy of Fallon which was
 
01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:52.490 align:start position:0%
condition tetralogy of Fallon which was
life-threatened

01:06:52.490 --> 01:06:52.500 align:start position:0%
life-threatened
 
01:06:54.410 --> 01:06:54.420 align:start position:0%
this started a parade of clinics and
 
01:06:56.450 --> 01:06:56.460 align:start position:0%
hospital visits where we clinical
 
01:06:58.190 --> 01:06:58.200 align:start position:0%
hospital visits we where we learned much
 
01:07:00.770 --> 01:07:00.780 align:start position:0%
more baby had numerous challenges beyond
 
01:07:02.470 --> 01:07:02.480 align:start position:0%
the Spina Bifida and the heart condition
 
01:07:05.990 --> 01:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
missing kidney missing anus missing
 
01:07:07.670 --> 01:07:07.680 align:start position:0%

01:07:09.950 --> 01:07:09.960 align:start position:0%

01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:11.329 align:start position:0%

01:07:11.329 --> 01:07:11.339 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
01:07:14.210 --> 01:07:14.220 align:start position:0%
numerous systems have problems most of
 
01:07:15.950 --> 01:07:15.960 align:start position:0%
which would require surgery soon after
 
01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
birth many surgeons
 
01:07:20.630 --> 01:07:20.640 align:start position:0%
our best case scenario became four or
 
01:07:22.490 --> 01:07:22.500 align:start position:0%
five surgeries in the first few weeks of
 
01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:23.150 align:start position:0%
five surgeries in the first few weeks of
life

01:07:23.150 --> 01:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
life
 
01:07:25.370 --> 01:07:25.380 align:start position:0%
followed by many additional high risk
 
01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:26.690 align:start position:0%
followed by many additional high risk
surgeries

01:07:26.690 --> 01:07:26.700 align:start position:0%
surgeries
 
01:07:28.970 --> 01:07:28.980 align:start position:0%
the odds were very very bad
 
01:07:31.250 --> 01:07:31.260 align:start position:0%
but not zero
 
01:07:33.230 --> 01:07:33.240 align:start position:0%
while the baby was in utero we could not
 
01:07:34.430 --> 01:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
get a clear enough picture to know
 
01:07:35.750 --> 01:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
whether or not his conditions were
 
01:07:37.370 --> 01:07:37.380 align:start position:0%
definitely fatal
 
01:07:39.829 --> 01:07:39.839 align:start position:0%
each individual condition had decent
 
01:07:41.990 --> 01:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
odds but the collection of conditions
 
01:07:44.750 --> 01:07:44.760 align:start position:0%
made the prognosis very complicated
 
01:07:46.549 --> 01:07:46.559 align:start position:0%
we were thankfully at a state-of-the-art
 
01:07:48.049 --> 01:07:48.059 align:start position:0%
hospital dealing with the best doctors
 
01:07:49.430 --> 01:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
in the world and these types of things
 
01:07:51.589 --> 01:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
but we just couldn't know given the
 
01:07:53.930 --> 01:07:53.940 align:start position:0%
state of Technology at the time
 
01:07:56.210 --> 01:07:56.220 align:start position:0%
Connor was born two months later
 
01:07:58.190 --> 01:07:58.200 align:start position:0%
once he was delivered the doctors were
 
01:08:00.529 --> 01:08:00.539 align:start position:0%
better able to assess his condition and
 
01:08:02.089 --> 01:08:02.099 align:start position:0%
we found out that there was no treatment
 
01:08:05.270 --> 01:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
and he would drive die very soon
 
01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:07.260 align:start position:0%
at first we could not hold him because
 
01:08:09.650 --> 01:08:09.660 align:start position:0%
his spinal Sac was exposed and any
 
01:08:11.390 --> 01:08:11.400 align:start position:0%
interaction ran the risk of infecting
 
01:08:13.069 --> 01:08:13.079 align:start position:0%
his spinal fluid
 
01:08:14.930 --> 01:08:14.940 align:start position:0%
but when we learned that his conditions
 
01:08:16.970 --> 01:08:16.980 align:start position:0%
were terminal the doctors transitioned
 
01:08:18.530 --> 01:08:18.540 align:start position:0%
to Comfort Care
 
01:08:20.329 --> 01:08:20.339 align:start position:0%
that was the best thing we could do for
 
01:08:20.339 --> 01:08:21.229 align:start position:0%
that was the best thing we could do for
him

01:08:21.229 --> 01:08:21.239 align:start position:0%
him
 
01:08:23.930 --> 01:08:23.940 align:start position:0%
no one else can tell me
 
01:08:27.410 --> 01:08:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:29.090 --> 01:08:29.100 align:start position:0%
the alternative would have been a series
 
01:08:31.189 --> 01:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
of surgeries to keep him alive a little
 
01:08:31.199 --> 01:08:32.689 align:start position:0%
of surgeries to keep him alive a little
longer

01:08:32.689 --> 01:08:32.699 align:start position:0%
longer
 
01:08:35.209 --> 01:08:35.219 align:start position:0%
while never being held by his parents
 
01:08:36.709 --> 01:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
might have survived the first surgery
 
01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
died in the second survived the second
 
01:08:41.570 --> 01:08:41.580 align:start position:0%
died in the third we don't know
 
01:08:43.669 --> 01:08:43.679 align:start position:0%
but he was going to die and so they
 
01:08:45.950 --> 01:08:45.960 align:start position:0%
chose not to put him through them
 
01:08:48.050 --> 01:08:48.060 align:start position:0%
this would have been cruel
 
01:08:50.930 --> 01:08:50.940 align:start position:0%
he didn't deserve cruelty
 
01:08:53.510 --> 01:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
owners survived for three days he was in
 
01:08:55.849 --> 01:08:55.859 align:start position:0%
unbearable pain the entire time
 
01:08:57.829 --> 01:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
likely from the time his nervous system
 
01:08:59.930 --> 01:08:59.940 align:start position:0%
first formed in utero
 
01:09:02.209 --> 01:09:02.219 align:start position:0%
the doctors had him on morphine from
 
01:09:02.219 --> 01:09:03.349 align:start position:0%
the doctors had him on morphine from
birth

01:09:03.349 --> 01:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
birth
 
01:09:06.470 --> 01:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
adult doses by the time he died
 
01:09:08.329 --> 01:09:08.339 align:start position:0%
what gives another person the right to
 
01:09:10.249 --> 01:09:10.259 align:start position:0%
tell my wife or I the right thing to do
 
01:09:12.229 --> 01:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
in this situation
 
01:09:14.450 --> 01:09:14.460 align:start position:0%
no State walk until a grieving couple
 
01:09:16.370 --> 01:09:16.380 align:start position:0%
that can't hold their child until he
 
01:09:18.769 --> 01:09:18.779 align:start position:0%
passes because every intervention must
 
01:09:20.269 --> 01:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
be tried
 
01:09:23.209 --> 01:09:23.219 align:start position:0%
even if doctors know it'll be futile
 
01:09:25.370 --> 01:09:25.380 align:start position:0%
people like myself my wife the doctors
 
01:09:27.470 --> 01:09:27.480 align:start position:0%
and nurses we worked with were all
 
01:09:29.209 --> 01:09:29.219 align:start position:0%
trying to do what is right
 
01:09:32.030 --> 01:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
in an unthinkable situation
 
01:09:34.430 --> 01:09:34.440 align:start position:0%
this bill is not about abortion
 
01:09:36.709 --> 01:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
it is about families like mine
 
01:09:38.630 --> 01:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
who are in heartbreaking complex
 
01:09:42.349 --> 01:09:42.359 align:start position:0%
situations when we talk about fatal
 
01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
fetal and that anomalies
 
01:09:48.349 --> 01:09:48.359 align:start position:0%
you can't classify these things
 
01:09:51.829 --> 01:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
Connor had a set of problems any one of
 
01:09:53.269 --> 01:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
them individually might have been
 
01:09:53.279 --> 01:09:54.350 align:start position:0%
them individually might have been
treatable

01:09:54.350 --> 01:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
treatable
 
01:09:56.209 --> 01:09:56.219 align:start position:0%
together they weren't
 
01:09:59.090 --> 01:09:59.100 align:start position:0%
and so you can't legislate that that I
 
01:10:00.650 --> 01:10:00.660 align:start position:0%
can understand
 
01:10:02.510 --> 01:10:02.520 align:start position:0%
families who planned on bringing home
 
01:10:04.370 --> 01:10:04.380 align:start position:0%
their baby and in the blink of an eye
 
01:10:07.550 --> 01:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
face the worst possible situation
 
01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
that's what we lived with
 
01:10:12.110 --> 01:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
any woman or couple going through these
 
01:10:14.990 --> 01:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
situations deserve support and empathy
 
01:10:17.870 --> 01:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
the choices made that were made were our
 
01:10:20.209 --> 01:10:20.219 align:start position:0%
choices cannot should not be made or
 
01:10:22.669 --> 01:10:22.679 align:start position:0%
judged by a government who thinks they
 
01:10:24.649 --> 01:10:24.659 align:start position:0%
know what's right
 
01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
when you deliberate this bill I hope you
 
01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
remember my story and Connor's story
 
01:10:31.790 --> 01:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
and do what's right for people like
 
01:10:34.070 --> 01:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
myself and New Hampshire families
 
01:10:35.689 --> 01:10:35.699 align:start position:0%
if this Bill had been passed before
 
01:10:37.669 --> 01:10:37.679 align:start position:0%
Conor had been born
 
01:10:40.310 --> 01:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
we would have had to go through these
 
01:10:41.930 --> 01:10:41.940 align:start position:0%
surgeries and have him die on an
 
01:10:43.610 --> 01:10:43.620 align:start position:0%
operating table
 
01:10:45.410 --> 01:10:45.420 align:start position:0%
and he would not have been held by his
 
01:10:45.420 --> 01:10:47.330 align:start position:0%
and he would not have been held by his
parents

01:10:47.330 --> 01:10:47.340 align:start position:0%
parents
 
01:10:49.490 --> 01:10:49.500 align:start position:0%
that's cruel
 
01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:56.330 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:10:56.330 --> 01:10:56.340 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:10:59.090 --> 01:10:59.100 align:start position:0%
thank you for the taking my question I'm
 
01:11:01.330 --> 01:11:01.340 align:start position:0%
so very sorry for the difficult
 
01:11:03.530 --> 01:11:03.540 align:start position:0%
experiences you and your wife and your
 
01:11:06.110 --> 01:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
family have had it's hard to listen to
 
01:11:07.310 --> 01:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
these things
 
01:11:10.610 --> 01:11:10.620 align:start position:0%
are you've related it so very well
 
01:11:15.050 --> 01:11:15.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:16.850 --> 01:11:16.860 align:start position:0%
what I did notice in your written
 
01:11:16.860 --> 01:11:18.709 align:start position:0%
what I did notice in your written
submission

01:11:18.709 --> 01:11:18.719 align:start position:0%
submission
 
01:11:21.410 --> 01:11:21.420 align:start position:0%
the words the doctors transitioned to
 
01:11:23.689 --> 01:11:23.699 align:start position:0%
Comfort Care
 
01:11:26.870 --> 01:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
fortunately the medical profession has
 
01:11:29.870 --> 01:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
done extremely well in providing
 
01:11:31.850 --> 01:11:31.860 align:start position:0%
palliative care
 
01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
in these situations as well as for older
 
01:11:36.830 --> 01:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
and elderly people facing their final
 
01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:39.350 align:start position:0%
and elderly people facing their final
hours

01:11:39.350 --> 01:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:42.050 --> 01:11:42.060 align:start position:0%
it sounds as though they did everything
 
01:11:45.790 --> 01:11:45.800 align:start position:0%
they could within a reasonable
 
01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:47.649 align:start position:0%
they could within a reasonable
way

01:11:47.649 --> 01:11:47.659 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:11:49.729 --> 01:11:49.739 align:start position:0%
but then
 
01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
let the inevitable of nature take over
 
01:11:56.570 --> 01:11:56.580 align:start position:0%
and enabled you to have moments
 
01:11:59.630 --> 01:11:59.640 align:start position:0%
with your with your child
 
01:12:00.950 --> 01:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
the medical
 
01:12:04.550 --> 01:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
people who aided you and performed
 
01:12:08.450 --> 01:12:08.460 align:start position:0%
were not near any type of a crime or a
 
01:12:10.550 --> 01:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
wrongdoing they were doing the best they
 
01:12:12.770 --> 01:12:12.780 align:start position:0%
could for you
 
01:12:15.709 --> 01:12:15.719 align:start position:0%
and again I have to draw you to that
 
01:12:19.430 --> 01:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
line line of page two
 
01:12:21.110 --> 01:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
the provider
 
01:12:25.729 --> 01:12:25.739 align:start position:0%
did not intentionally cause or hasten
 
01:12:31.270 --> 01:12:31.280 align:start position:0%
the abnormality brought life to its end
 
01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:33.110 align:start position:0%
the abnormality brought life to its end
unfortunately

01:12:33.110 --> 01:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
01:12:36.350 --> 01:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
but the doctors didn't hasten that
 
01:12:38.990 --> 01:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
they didn't intentionally terminate nor
 
01:12:41.450 --> 01:12:41.460 align:start position:0%
did you give any order to do so
 
01:12:43.610 --> 01:12:43.620 align:start position:0%
this bill is a fart
 
01:12:47.689 --> 01:12:47.699 align:start position:0%
a far removal from the sad circumstances
 
01:12:49.850 --> 01:12:49.860 align:start position:0%
that you endured
 
01:12:54.169 --> 01:12:54.179 align:start position:0%
and I'm sorry for your loss in that case
 
01:12:58.189 --> 01:12:58.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony uh so not
 
01:13:01.550 --> 01:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
providing surgeries to him hastened his
 
01:13:04.070 --> 01:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
death he died after three days
 
01:13:05.930 --> 01:13:05.940 align:start position:0%
and he might have lived through the
 
01:13:09.350 --> 01:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
first surgery to close the spinal column
 
01:13:11.030 --> 01:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
you probably wouldn't have lived through
 
01:13:11.990 --> 01:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
the second
 
01:13:14.510 --> 01:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
odds kept going down so he would have
 
01:13:16.250 --> 01:13:16.260 align:start position:0%
died on the table but he would have
 
01:13:18.410 --> 01:13:18.420 align:start position:0%
lived longer than three days so by not
 
01:13:20.630 --> 01:13:20.640 align:start position:0%
performing surgery they did hasten his
 
01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:21.410 align:start position:0%
performing surgery they did hasten his
death

01:13:21.410 --> 01:13:21.420 align:start position:0%
death
 
01:13:24.590 --> 01:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
but they didn't intentionally hasten
 
01:13:26.270 --> 01:13:26.280 align:start position:0%
or terminate
 
01:13:27.770 --> 01:13:27.780 align:start position:0%
the choice
 
01:13:30.229 --> 01:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
was yours to make
 
01:13:32.930 --> 01:13:32.940 align:start position:0%
but there's a difference and that's what
 
01:13:34.970 --> 01:13:34.980 align:start position:0%
the law is focused on the difference I
 
01:13:37.370 --> 01:13:37.380 align:start position:0%
can't speak not the emotional trauma and
 
01:13:40.970 --> 01:13:40.980 align:start position:0%
the unfortunate circumstances that this
 
01:13:40.980 --> 01:13:43.310 align:start position:0%
the unfortunate circumstances that this
occurred

01:13:43.310 --> 01:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
occurred
 
01:13:47.030 --> 01:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much sir
 
01:13:50.930 --> 01:13:50.940 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative Matt Simon
 
01:13:53.510 --> 01:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
and after that uh representative uh
 
01:13:57.110 --> 01:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
Catherine from Bruno O'Brien
 
01:13:58.790 --> 01:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
thank you so much Mr chair honorable
 
01:14:00.050 --> 01:14:00.060 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
01:14:02.390 --> 01:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
my name is representative Matt Simon I
 
01:14:04.310 --> 01:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
represent Grafton district one Littleton
 
01:14:07.250 --> 01:14:07.260 align:start position:0%
Lisbon Lyman Sugar Hill bath and Monroe
 
01:14:09.530 --> 01:14:09.540 align:start position:0%
I'm here today in support of the bill as
 
01:14:11.870 --> 01:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
a co-sponsor of the bill
 
01:14:13.669 --> 01:14:13.679 align:start position:0%
um I do have to get to a committee so I
 
01:14:15.950 --> 01:14:15.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate you moving me up in in the
 
01:14:17.270 --> 01:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
timetable here
 
01:14:18.229 --> 01:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
um after listening to some of the
 
01:14:20.030 --> 01:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
testimony I just wanted to point out a
 
01:14:22.250 --> 01:14:22.260 align:start position:0%
few points on this particular bill for
 
01:14:25.850 --> 01:14:25.860 align:start position:0%
the committee's consideration the
 
01:14:28.689 --> 01:14:28.699 align:start position:0%
substance of the bill indicates that
 
01:14:31.130 --> 01:14:31.140 align:start position:0%
children who are infants who have
 
01:14:33.110 --> 01:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
survived to the point of birth are to be
 
01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
treated no differently than anybody else
 
01:14:37.310 --> 01:14:37.320 align:start position:0%
at any other age
 
01:14:40.310 --> 01:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
um a few years back my my mother was
 
01:14:43.610 --> 01:14:43.620 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with cancer it was speeding
 
01:14:45.709 --> 01:14:45.719 align:start position:0%
um within a few course of a few weeks it
 
01:14:48.229 --> 01:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
had taken over her intestines and we
 
01:14:50.450 --> 01:14:50.460 align:start position:0%
lost her very rapidly
 
01:14:50.460 --> 01:14:51.110 align:start position:0%
lost her very rapidly
um

01:14:51.110 --> 01:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:53.630 --> 01:14:53.640 align:start position:0%
during the course of that the doctors
 
01:14:55.490 --> 01:14:55.500 align:start position:0%
met with us and they said here's what we
 
01:14:57.110 --> 01:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
can do what do you want to do and we had
 
01:14:58.910 --> 01:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
conversations about that and eventually
 
01:14:59.990 --> 01:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
the doctor came back and said listen
 
01:15:01.070 --> 01:15:01.080 align:start position:0%
there's just nothing else we can do
 
01:15:02.630 --> 01:15:02.640 align:start position:0%
we've done everything that we've tried
 
01:15:04.610 --> 01:15:04.620 align:start position:0%
to do and and there's nothing more that
 
01:15:07.070 --> 01:15:07.080 align:start position:0%
we can do other than keep her
 
01:15:08.930 --> 01:15:08.940 align:start position:0%
you know keep her comfortable
 
01:15:12.050 --> 01:15:12.060 align:start position:0%
and um so
 
01:15:14.390 --> 01:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
that was the decision that we decided to
 
01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:15.290 align:start position:0%
that was the decision that we decided to
make

01:15:15.290 --> 01:15:15.300 align:start position:0%
make
 
01:15:16.729 --> 01:15:16.739 align:start position:0%
um even though they were not going to
 
01:15:19.070 --> 01:15:19.080 align:start position:0%
continue to try medical procedures to
 
01:15:20.750 --> 01:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
save her life that was in no way
 
01:15:22.910 --> 01:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
indicated that the doctors were somehow
 
01:15:24.830 --> 01:15:24.840 align:start position:0%
hastening her death in that circumstance
 
01:15:27.189 --> 01:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
my point being that the bill is meant to
 
01:15:29.630 --> 01:15:29.640 align:start position:0%
mirror in this age what happens in the
 
01:15:31.610 --> 01:15:31.620 align:start position:0%
medical profession at every age and at
 
01:15:33.890 --> 01:15:33.900 align:start position:0%
every age there is leeway within for the
 
01:15:35.750 --> 01:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
medical profession to make these
 
01:15:37.729 --> 01:15:37.739 align:start position:0%
difficult decisions it is not a
 
01:15:39.470 --> 01:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
one-size-fits-all even there sometimes
 
01:15:40.910 --> 01:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
they have to make the difficult decision
 
01:15:43.130 --> 01:15:43.140 align:start position:0%
to not pursue further medical care so I
 
01:15:45.530 --> 01:15:45.540 align:start position:0%
just want the committee to take that
 
01:15:47.030 --> 01:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
into consideration
 
01:15:48.590 --> 01:15:48.600 align:start position:0%
um and to point out what representative
 
01:15:50.030 --> 01:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
Stapleton has been pointing out uh
 
01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:51.590 align:start position:0%
Stapleton has been pointing out uh
regularly

01:15:51.590 --> 01:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
regularly
 
01:15:55.189 --> 01:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
um at what other point in our lives
 
01:15:57.290 --> 01:15:57.300 align:start position:0%
would a medical professional be allowed
 
01:15:59.930 --> 01:15:59.940 align:start position:0%
to intentionally withhold Medical Care
 
01:16:02.450 --> 01:16:02.460 align:start position:0%
or intentionally hasten the death of any
 
01:16:03.590 --> 01:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
of us
 
01:16:05.810 --> 01:16:05.820 align:start position:0%
when does that when does that exist at
 
01:16:08.450 --> 01:16:08.460 align:start position:0%
any other point in development and to to
 
01:16:09.950 --> 01:16:09.960 align:start position:0%
just address the one of the concerns
 
01:16:12.649 --> 01:16:12.659 align:start position:0%
that was spoken before
 
01:16:16.310 --> 01:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
um well first off let me just say um
 
01:16:18.050 --> 01:16:18.060 align:start position:0%
we've had some doctors and I'm hoping
 
01:16:19.310 --> 01:16:19.320 align:start position:0%
that doctors if this is the case can
 
01:16:21.229 --> 01:16:21.239 align:start position:0%
testify to this later for you but uh
 
01:16:22.669 --> 01:16:22.679 align:start position:0%
indicating that no medical professional
 
01:16:24.110 --> 01:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
would ever do anything like this and I
 
01:16:25.189 --> 01:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
would just submit to the committee that
 
01:16:27.050 --> 01:16:27.060 align:start position:0%
no medical professional is qualified to
 
01:16:28.669 --> 01:16:28.679 align:start position:0%
speak to what every other Medical
 
01:16:31.070 --> 01:16:31.080 align:start position:0%
Professional would or would not do
 
01:16:32.390 --> 01:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
um that's not something that's within
 
01:16:34.970 --> 01:16:34.980 align:start position:0%
their purview to to make as a claim so I
 
01:16:36.590 --> 01:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
would encourage the committee to keep
 
01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:37.729 align:start position:0%
would encourage the committee to keep
that

01:16:37.729 --> 01:16:37.739 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:16:40.250 --> 01:16:40.260 align:start position:0%
um take that into consideration as well
 
01:16:44.390 --> 01:16:44.400 align:start position:0%
um but having said that uh once again
 
01:16:46.729 --> 01:16:46.739 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions that
 
01:16:48.050 --> 01:16:48.060 align:start position:0%
anybody might have on the uh
 
01:16:48.060 --> 01:16:55.310 align:start position:0%
anybody might have on the uh
representative

01:16:55.310 --> 01:16:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:57.470 --> 01:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
there's a few things that I've heard sad
 
01:16:59.390 --> 01:16:59.400 align:start position:0%
but don't match what's in the bill and
 
01:17:02.810 --> 01:17:02.820 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if you're willing to work
 
01:17:06.590 --> 01:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
together to amend the bill for example
 
01:17:09.470 --> 01:17:09.480 align:start position:0%
it was just asked well by the
 
01:17:10.910 --> 01:17:10.920 align:start position:0%
representative over here this this
 
01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:11.990 align:start position:0%
representative over here this this
doesn't

01:17:11.990 --> 01:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:13.790 align:start position:0%
doesn't
um

01:17:13.790 --> 01:17:13.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:15.649 --> 01:17:15.659 align:start position:0%
you gave permission for that this wasn't
 
01:17:17.149 --> 01:17:17.159 align:start position:0%
the Doctor's choice but that the bill
 
01:17:20.149 --> 01:17:20.159 align:start position:0%
does actually explicitly say that a
 
01:17:22.010 --> 01:17:22.020 align:start position:0%
directive or other instruction to
 
01:17:23.930 --> 01:17:23.940 align:start position:0%
withhold treatment from a borderline
 
01:17:26.990 --> 01:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
alive infant shall not be a defense yes
 
01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:28.910 align:start position:0%
alive infant shall not be a defense yes
so

01:17:28.910 --> 01:17:28.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:17:31.250 --> 01:17:31.260 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm hearing is part of the
 
01:17:33.530 --> 01:17:33.540 align:start position:0%
big concern here is that should an
 
01:17:35.990 --> 01:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
infant be born alive but has a fetal
 
01:17:38.750 --> 01:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
fetal anomaly or had a traumatic birth
 
01:17:41.689 --> 01:17:41.699 align:start position:0%
and has another anomaly that is there
 
01:17:41.699 --> 01:17:43.790 align:start position:0%
and has another anomaly that is there
for

01:17:43.790 --> 01:17:43.800 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:17:46.070 --> 01:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
incompatible with any sort of quality of
 
01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:47.689 align:start position:0%
incompatible with any sort of quality of
life

01:17:47.689 --> 01:17:47.699 align:start position:0%
life
 
01:17:49.310 --> 01:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
would you be willing to provide
 
01:17:51.649 --> 01:17:51.659 align:start position:0%
exceptions for that
 
01:17:53.390 --> 01:17:53.400 align:start position:0%
um so 2.5 million thank you for the
 
01:17:55.370 --> 01:17:55.380 align:start position:0%
question representative um I would
 
01:17:57.350 --> 01:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
answer on the whole if it is a problem
 
01:17:59.330 --> 01:17:59.340 align:start position:0%
yes I believe that the co-sponsors and
 
01:18:00.350 --> 01:18:00.360 align:start position:0%
sponsor are willing to have a
 
01:18:01.490 --> 01:18:01.500 align:start position:0%
conversation of what that would look
 
01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:02.630 align:start position:0%
conversation of what that would look
like

01:18:02.630 --> 01:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:18:04.310 --> 01:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
um to address that particular process
 
01:18:06.410 --> 01:18:06.420 align:start position:0%
problem I would also just urge the
 
01:18:09.290 --> 01:18:09.300 align:start position:0%
committee members to study and determine
 
01:18:11.390 --> 01:18:11.400 align:start position:0%
whether or not those circumstances would
 
01:18:13.250 --> 01:18:13.260 align:start position:0%
be treated any differently at any other
 
01:18:16.310 --> 01:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
stage in life I recognize that a very
 
01:18:18.229 --> 01:18:18.239 align:start position:0%
particular point in our lifespan is
 
01:18:20.090 --> 01:18:20.100 align:start position:0%
being addressed in this bill but there
 
01:18:22.910 --> 01:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
are also other times within our lives
 
01:18:24.890 --> 01:18:24.900 align:start position:0%
when we could run into a very similar
 
01:18:26.630 --> 01:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
situation and what does the medical
 
01:18:28.850 --> 01:18:28.860 align:start position:0%
Fields do in that particular situation
 
01:18:32.090 --> 01:18:32.100 align:start position:0%
do they have any leeway to make you know
 
01:18:33.950 --> 01:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
medical decisions my argument would be
 
01:18:36.110 --> 01:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
yes they do have the ability to do that
 
01:18:38.209 --> 01:18:38.219 align:start position:0%
so they would still have the ability to
 
01:18:39.709 --> 01:18:39.719 align:start position:0%
do that here
 
01:18:41.209 --> 01:18:41.219 align:start position:0%
um as at least as long as I'm reading
 
01:18:42.890 --> 01:18:42.900 align:start position:0%
this bill correctly that is the intent
 
01:18:45.530 --> 01:18:45.540 align:start position:0%
but however if you decide that it isn't
 
01:18:47.209 --> 01:18:47.219 align:start position:0%
going to actually work that way we're
 
01:18:48.649 --> 01:18:48.659 align:start position:0%
willing certainly willing to have a
 
01:18:51.649 --> 01:18:51.659 align:start position:0%
conversation it is not our intent
 
01:18:51.659 --> 01:18:53.330 align:start position:0%
conversation it is not our intent
to

01:18:53.330 --> 01:18:53.340 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:18:56.209 --> 01:18:56.219 align:start position:0%
take a child from a parent's arms right
 
01:18:58.850 --> 01:18:58.860 align:start position:0%
after birth and not give them that time
 
01:19:01.430 --> 01:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
because they have to be rushed off to do
 
01:19:03.050 --> 01:19:03.060 align:start position:0%
a treatment that isn't isn't going to do
 
01:19:05.630 --> 01:19:05.640 align:start position:0%
them any material good
 
01:19:08.689 --> 01:19:08.699 align:start position:0%
um that's not the intent
 
01:19:13.070 --> 01:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:19.550 --> 01:19:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:22.430 --> 01:19:22.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:19:26.030 --> 01:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
um I've heard a lot of talk about you
 
01:19:28.250 --> 01:19:28.260 align:start position:0%
know Physicians Do no harm they take an
 
01:19:30.649 --> 01:19:30.659 align:start position:0%
oath for that there's a presumption
 
01:19:34.189 --> 01:19:34.199 align:start position:0%
going on that is suggesting that doctors
 
01:19:36.169 --> 01:19:36.179 align:start position:0%
are automatically
 
01:19:40.490 --> 01:19:40.500 align:start position:0%
um in in a case of abortion just a child
 
01:19:41.870 --> 01:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
that survives
 
01:19:45.830 --> 01:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
an abortion that they're lying on a
 
01:19:48.410 --> 01:19:48.420 align:start position:0%
table and that a physician is then now
 
01:19:51.470 --> 01:19:51.480 align:start position:0%
somehow terminating the death from that
 
01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:52.910 align:start position:0%
somehow terminating the death from that
point

01:19:52.910 --> 01:19:52.920 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:19:55.490 --> 01:19:55.500 align:start position:0%
um are there statistics in New Hampshire
 
01:19:56.689 --> 01:19:56.699 align:start position:0%
I heard
 
01:19:58.370 --> 01:19:58.380 align:start position:0%
um other testimony that there were
 
01:20:01.189 --> 01:20:01.199 align:start position:0%
statistics in other states but in New
 
01:20:03.890 --> 01:20:03.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is that happening on a regular
 
01:20:06.830 --> 01:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
basis or is that just something that's
 
01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:08.510 align:start position:0%
basis or is that just something that's
hypothetical

01:20:08.510 --> 01:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
hypothetical
 
01:20:10.850 --> 01:20:10.860 align:start position:0%
um we keep notes no statistics on
 
01:20:12.050 --> 01:20:12.060 align:start position:0%
abortion in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:20:12.060 --> 01:20:13.610 align:start position:0%
abortion in the state of New Hampshire
whatsoever

01:20:13.610 --> 01:20:13.620 align:start position:0%
whatsoever
 
01:20:15.950 --> 01:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
um I believe that once again we wouldn't
 
01:20:17.750 --> 01:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
be coming with this particular Bill if
 
01:20:19.729 --> 01:20:19.739 align:start position:0%
there was not concern
 
01:20:21.709 --> 01:20:21.719 align:start position:0%
um that and particularly in abortion
 
01:20:21.719 --> 01:20:23.510 align:start position:0%
um that and particularly in abortion
situations

01:20:23.510 --> 01:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
situations
 
01:20:25.189 --> 01:20:25.199 align:start position:0%
um this kind of situation might arrive
 
01:20:26.870 --> 01:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
it does arise and does happen we
 
01:20:28.189 --> 01:20:28.199 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be worried about it if we
 
01:20:29.750 --> 01:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
didn't have testimony from people that
 
01:20:31.430 --> 01:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
said that they've observed this witness
 
01:20:33.229 --> 01:20:33.239 align:start position:0%
that's gone through this
 
01:20:34.669 --> 01:20:34.679 align:start position:0%
um and so that's the purpose for
 
01:20:35.630 --> 01:20:35.640 align:start position:0%
bringing the bill but as far as
 
01:20:37.010 --> 01:20:37.020 align:start position:0%
statistics are concerned we don't we
 
01:20:39.169 --> 01:20:39.179 align:start position:0%
don't keep any statistics
 
01:20:41.510 --> 01:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
did that answer your question yes it did
 
01:20:43.790 --> 01:20:43.800 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions for this
 
01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:46.130 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions for this
Witness

01:20:46.130 --> 01:20:46.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:48.169 --> 01:20:48.179 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much and if I
 
01:20:50.990 --> 01:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
may um Mr chair just briefly um I'm
 
01:20:52.189 --> 01:20:52.199 align:start position:0%
making myself in trouble for this one
 
01:20:54.830 --> 01:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
but if it's not an abortion bill
 
01:20:57.050 --> 01:20:57.060 align:start position:0%
the everybody I've gone to a lot of
 
01:20:59.030 --> 01:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
these everybody who cares about abortion
 
01:21:02.689 --> 01:21:02.699 align:start position:0%
on both sides is in the room so um just
 
01:21:04.990 --> 01:21:05.000 align:start position:0%
a another point but thank you
 
01:21:07.550 --> 01:21:07.560 align:start position:0%
representative uh Catherine fruitholm
 
01:21:10.189 --> 01:21:10.199 align:start position:0%
O'Brien which and the next witness will
 
01:21:14.630 --> 01:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:16.910 --> 01:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I hope everyone can
 
01:21:20.209 --> 01:21:20.219 align:start position:0%
hear me these microphones are tricky
 
01:21:22.310 --> 01:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
I'm going to say the quiet part out loud
 
01:21:24.110 --> 01:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to address the elephant
 
01:21:25.729 --> 01:21:25.739 align:start position:0%
in the room and that's why I came here
 
01:21:25.739 --> 01:21:29.810 align:start position:0%
in the room and that's why I came here
today

01:21:29.810 --> 01:21:29.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:33.229 --> 01:21:33.239 align:start position:0%
an infant born alive who grows up and
 
01:21:35.330 --> 01:21:35.340 align:start position:0%
becomes an adult
 
01:21:37.310 --> 01:21:37.320 align:start position:0%
after they have survived abortion is
 
01:21:38.990 --> 01:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
very inconvenient to the abortion
 
01:21:41.810 --> 01:21:41.820 align:start position:0%
narrative about what abortion really is
 
01:21:44.090 --> 01:21:44.100 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking of someone like Paula
 
01:21:44.100 --> 01:21:45.890 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking of someone like Paula
LePage

01:21:45.890 --> 01:21:45.900 align:start position:0%
LePage
 
01:21:47.930 --> 01:21:47.940 align:start position:0%
from Milton New Hampshire she survived
 
01:21:50.689 --> 01:21:50.699 align:start position:0%
abortion she has a scar across her face
 
01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
and she has a limp and if as an adult
 
01:21:55.310 --> 01:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
you ask her why do you have that large
 
01:21:57.709 --> 01:21:57.719 align:start position:0%
scar why do you have that limp and she
 
01:22:00.830 --> 01:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
was to tell you I survived abortion my
 
01:22:02.990 --> 01:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
mother had an abortion procedure and it
 
01:22:05.330 --> 01:22:05.340 align:start position:0%
didn't work that was in the late 50s
 
01:22:08.090 --> 01:22:08.100 align:start position:0%
that she had that in Maine
 
01:22:10.130 --> 01:22:10.140 align:start position:0%
and she was born and she was very much
 
01:22:12.590 --> 01:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
wanted it was poverty that caused her
 
01:22:15.050 --> 01:22:15.060 align:start position:0%
mother to seek seek the abortion she
 
01:22:17.209 --> 01:22:17.219 align:start position:0%
thought she had no choice after Apollo
 
01:22:19.189 --> 01:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
was born she was very happy about that
 
01:22:22.370 --> 01:22:22.380 align:start position:0%
she was very happy
 
01:22:22.380 --> 01:22:24.350 align:start position:0%
she was very happy
yeah

01:22:24.350 --> 01:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:22:26.810 --> 01:22:26.820 align:start position:0%
since then abortion procedures have
 
01:22:30.169 --> 01:22:30.179 align:start position:0%
become far more lethal and effective so
 
01:22:31.430 --> 01:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
we don't have to deal with the
 
01:22:33.770 --> 01:22:33.780 align:start position:0%
inconvenience of people walking around
 
01:22:35.390 --> 01:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
with missing limbs after surviving
 
01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:37.130 align:start position:0%
with missing limbs after surviving
abortion

01:22:37.130 --> 01:22:37.140 align:start position:0%
abortion
 
01:22:39.470 --> 01:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
if we did we would see abortion for what
 
01:22:42.770 --> 01:22:42.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:45.770 --> 01:22:45.780 align:start position:0%
I was diagnosed with a very rare genetic
 
01:22:48.169 --> 01:22:48.179 align:start position:0%
issue when I was pregnant with my last
 
01:22:50.510 --> 01:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
child it affects people of French
 
01:22:52.370 --> 01:22:52.380 align:start position:0%
Canadian descent it's similar to Tay
 
01:22:52.380 --> 01:22:55.550 align:start position:0%
Canadian descent it's similar to Tay
Sachs

01:22:55.550 --> 01:22:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:57.770 --> 01:22:57.780 align:start position:0%
there's no chance that the child will
 
01:22:59.510 --> 01:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
survive after about three years of age
 
01:23:03.410 --> 01:23:03.420 align:start position:0%
with that disease if my if the situation
 
01:23:05.570 --> 01:23:05.580 align:start position:0%
was that my husband also had it and the
 
01:23:07.370 --> 01:23:07.380 align:start position:0%
child was born with it well
 
01:23:09.950 --> 01:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
that didn't happen thankfully but
 
01:23:12.410 --> 01:23:12.420 align:start position:0%
if it had there's no chance the child
 
01:23:14.750 --> 01:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
would survive that's a that's a
 
01:23:16.610 --> 01:23:16.620 align:start position:0%
situation incompatible with life but
 
01:23:18.590 --> 01:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
after the child is born if that child
 
01:23:20.330 --> 01:23:20.340 align:start position:0%
was diagnosed with it at that point
 
01:23:22.610 --> 01:23:22.620 align:start position:0%
would they say to me
 
01:23:25.070 --> 01:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
your child your infant here that you're
 
01:23:27.229 --> 01:23:27.239 align:start position:0%
holding has this disease and will not
 
01:23:28.550 --> 01:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
live past the age of three there's
 
01:23:30.169 --> 01:23:30.179 align:start position:0%
absolutely no chance it's never happened
 
01:23:32.750 --> 01:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
before in the history of the world
 
01:23:35.390 --> 01:23:35.400 align:start position:0%
would you like to kill that child have a
 
01:23:37.430 --> 01:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
post-bought a birth abortion or
 
01:23:38.990 --> 01:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
01:23:40.970 --> 01:23:40.980 align:start position:0%
do you think that would be Humane what
 
01:23:43.250 --> 01:23:43.260 align:start position:0%
kind of society would that be is that
 
01:23:44.810 --> 01:23:44.820 align:start position:0%
the one we want to live in
 
01:23:46.610 --> 01:23:46.620 align:start position:0%
you know you everyone knows what I'm
 
01:23:48.410 --> 01:23:48.420 align:start position:0%
saying is true
 
01:23:50.090 --> 01:23:50.100 align:start position:0%
everyone knows that it would be very
 
01:23:51.590 --> 01:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
inconvenient for this narrative to have
 
01:23:53.510 --> 01:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
people walking around missing arms and
 
01:23:55.430 --> 01:23:55.440 align:start position:0%

01:24:05.630 --> 01:24:05.640 align:start position:0%
are there any questions that's all I
 
01:24:07.189 --> 01:24:07.199 align:start position:0%
really had to say questions for this
 
01:24:07.199 --> 01:24:09.950 align:start position:0%
really had to say questions for this
Witness

Albus tries I think and I apologize if
 
01:24:27.910 --> 01:24:27.920 align:start position:0%
I'm pronouncing that incorrect
 
01:24:30.830 --> 01:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
missy good morning uh thank you chairman
 
01:24:33.110 --> 01:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
Lynn and honorable committee members my
 
01:24:35.149 --> 01:24:35.159 align:start position:0%
name is Elizabeth Eaton I work at the
 
01:24:37.430 --> 01:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
office of professional licensure and

Council for the various boards uh and
 
01:24:45.649 --> 01:24:45.659 align:start position:0%
councils I'm here representing the
 
01:24:48.530 --> 01:24:48.540 align:start position:0%
Midwifery Council which is made up of
 
01:24:51.350 --> 01:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire certified midwives one OB
 
01:24:54.050 --> 01:24:54.060 align:start position:0%
GYN and one pediatrician
 
01:24:57.250 --> 01:24:57.260 align:start position:0%
they prepared some testimony based on
 
01:25:00.169 --> 01:25:00.179 align:start position:0%
lengthy discussion when they considered
 
01:25:02.149 --> 01:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
this bill and I'm here to read the
 
01:25:03.830 --> 01:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
testimony I can take some questions
 
01:25:07.370 --> 01:25:07.380 align:start position:0%
based on the discussion that I witnessed
 
01:25:09.290 --> 01:25:09.300 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire Midwifery Council
 
01:25:10.910 --> 01:25:10.920 align:start position:0%
opposes this bill
 
01:25:12.950 --> 01:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
there are circumstances in which a
 
01:25:15.950 --> 01:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
pre-viable fetus or paraviable fetus is
 
01:25:18.229 --> 01:25:18.239 align:start position:0%
born with a heartbeat but for whom
 
01:25:21.169 --> 01:25:21.179 align:start position:0%
resuscitation efforts would be futile
 
01:25:23.750 --> 01:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
the proposed legislation criminalizes
 
01:25:26.330 --> 01:25:26.340 align:start position:0%
the clinical judgment and care of
 
01:25:28.610 --> 01:25:28.620 align:start position:0%
licensed health care providers who
 
01:25:31.990 --> 01:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
appropriately pivot from feudal heroic
 
01:25:34.790 --> 01:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
resuscitation efforts to providing
 
01:25:37.610 --> 01:25:37.620 align:start position:0%
condolence and palliative care to
 
01:25:41.090 --> 01:25:41.100 align:start position:0%
traumatized parents and tiny babies
 
01:25:43.669 --> 01:25:43.679 align:start position:0%
the council is concerned with who
 
01:25:46.550 --> 01:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
decides the intention of the health care
 
01:25:49.370 --> 01:25:49.380 align:start position:0%
provider in that circumstance
 
01:25:52.310 --> 01:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
that closes their testimony right
 
01:25:54.530 --> 01:25:54.540 align:start position:0%
questions for this week
 
01:25:57.050 --> 01:25:57.060 align:start position:0%

Albus tries I hope I'm pronouncing that

correctly and the next witness will
 
01:26:19.970 --> 01:26:19.980 align:start position:0%

I have the words I'd like to say that
 
01:26:31.669 --> 01:26:31.679 align:start position:0%
I'll read
 
01:26:33.290 --> 01:26:33.300 align:start position:0%
um but then just sitting here listening
 
01:26:35.330 --> 01:26:35.340 align:start position:0%
to all the discussion if I can just
 
01:26:37.250 --> 01:26:37.260 align:start position:0%
indulge me with a comment or two after
 
01:26:39.470 --> 01:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
my written words thank you
 
01:26:43.010 --> 01:26:43.020 align:start position:0%
my name is Dr Daniela bushes I'm here to
 
01:26:47.330 --> 01:26:47.340 align:start position:0%
oppose HB 346 I'm an OB GYN and have the
 
01:26:48.830 --> 01:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
privilege to help women and their
 
01:26:50.990 --> 01:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
families navigate low and high risk
 
01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:52.010 align:start position:0%
families navigate low and high risk
pregnancies

01:26:52.010 --> 01:26:52.020 align:start position:0%
pregnancies
 
01:26:54.350 --> 01:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
like all dedicated Health Care Providers
 
01:26:57.350 --> 01:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
I take seriously my oath to take all
 
01:26:59.390 --> 01:26:59.400 align:start position:0%
medically appropriate and reasonable
 
01:27:01.610 --> 01:27:01.620 align:start position:0%
actions to preserve the life and health
 
01:27:02.990 --> 01:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
of a newborn
 
01:27:05.390 --> 01:27:05.400 align:start position:0%
to be clear infants born are already
 
01:27:07.490 --> 01:27:07.500 align:start position:0%
protected under New Hampshire's criminal
 
01:27:10.610 --> 01:27:10.620 align:start position:0%
statutes any infant born no matter the
 
01:27:12.830 --> 01:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
circumstance currently receives what is
 
01:27:14.570 --> 01:27:14.580 align:start position:0%
within the standard of care for the
 
01:27:14.580 --> 01:27:15.950 align:start position:0%
within the standard of care for the
situation

01:27:15.950 --> 01:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:27:18.470 --> 01:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
I'm here to describe how detrimental HB
 
01:27:20.870 --> 01:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
346 is to families who are already
 
01:27:23.090 --> 01:27:23.100 align:start position:0%
struggling with coming to terms that
 
01:27:25.669 --> 01:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
their baby will not survive on its own
 
01:27:27.590 --> 01:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
most of my work involves normal
 
01:27:29.649 --> 01:27:29.659 align:start position:0%
pregnancies and joyous births
 
01:27:32.209 --> 01:27:32.219 align:start position:0%
unfortunately as we have heard there are
 
01:27:33.770 --> 01:27:33.780 align:start position:0%
pregnancies that are identified through
 
01:27:35.450 --> 01:27:35.460 align:start position:0%
the course of prenatal care to be
 
01:27:37.250 --> 01:27:37.260 align:start position:0%
incompatible with life outside the
 
01:27:39.950 --> 01:27:39.960 align:start position:0%
uterus and when I say incompatible with
 
01:27:42.110 --> 01:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
life outside the uterus I mean a fatal
 
01:27:44.330 --> 01:27:44.340 align:start position:0%
fetal anomaly like when the fetus has
 
01:27:46.430 --> 01:27:46.440 align:start position:0%
not developed a brain or if very early
 
01:27:47.990 --> 01:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
labor occurs
 
01:27:50.450 --> 01:27:50.460 align:start position:0%
when a fatal fetal diagnosis is made we
 
01:27:53.330 --> 01:27:53.340 align:start position:0%
offer information compassion and choice
 
01:27:55.550 --> 01:27:55.560 align:start position:0%
many women and their families choose to
 
01:27:57.350 --> 01:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
continue the pregnancy knowing that the
 
01:27:59.870 --> 01:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
fetus may die inside the uterus some
 
01:28:01.610 --> 01:28:01.620 align:start position:0%
will choose induction of Labor or wait
 
01:28:04.550 --> 01:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
for spontaneous labor these babies will
 
01:28:05.990 --> 01:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
die after birth
 
01:28:07.910 --> 01:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
the goal for these women and families is
 
01:28:09.709 --> 01:28:09.719 align:start position:0%
to have the opportunity to meet their
 
01:28:12.169 --> 01:28:12.179 align:start position:0%
baby hold their baby and continue the
 
01:28:13.610 --> 01:28:13.620 align:start position:0%
grieving process
 
01:28:15.709 --> 01:28:15.719 align:start position:0%
for these babies as well as other babies
 
01:28:17.750 --> 01:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
born too early with no chance of
 
01:28:19.970 --> 01:28:19.980 align:start position:0%
survival there are long discussions with
 
01:28:22.550 --> 01:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
the hospice team to formulate a plan for
 
01:28:24.530 --> 01:28:24.540 align:start position:0%
comfort care after the birth
 
01:28:26.689 --> 01:28:26.699 align:start position:0%
women and families want whatever time
 
01:28:28.550 --> 01:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
they have with their baby to be peaceful
 
01:28:30.709 --> 01:28:30.719 align:start position:0%
this is what these grieving families
 
01:28:33.290 --> 01:28:33.300 align:start position:0%
deserve the choice that these families
 
01:28:36.169 --> 01:28:36.179 align:start position:0%
make as we've heard is devastating but
 
01:28:37.910 --> 01:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
their personal with their personal
 
01:28:40.310 --> 01:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
decisions and it's the job of the team
 
01:28:42.410 --> 01:28:42.420 align:start position:0%
of trusted Healthcare professionals to
 
01:28:44.810 --> 01:28:44.820 align:start position:0%
explain all the facts we cannot make
 
01:28:46.669 --> 01:28:46.679 align:start position:0%
this decision for them
 
01:28:48.830 --> 01:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
what is so problematic about this bill
 
01:28:50.390 --> 01:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
is that it removes this difficult
 
01:28:52.370 --> 01:28:52.380 align:start position:0%
decision-making out of the hands of the
 
01:28:54.770 --> 01:28:54.780 align:start position:0%
family and it will force neonatologists
 
01:28:56.750 --> 01:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
or pediatricians to take these babies
 
01:28:59.090 --> 01:28:59.100 align:start position:0%
who have no chance of survival and
 
01:29:01.209 --> 01:29:01.219 align:start position:0%
subject them to invasive procedures
 
01:29:04.070 --> 01:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
invasive procedures like breathing tubes
 
01:29:06.649 --> 01:29:06.659 align:start position:0%
IV access through the umbilical cord and
 
01:29:09.229 --> 01:29:09.239 align:start position:0%
required separation from the family
 
01:29:12.649 --> 01:29:12.659 align:start position:0%
based on HB 346 if a provider does not
 
01:29:14.629 --> 01:29:14.639 align:start position:0%
force these procedures on a baby that
 
01:29:16.790 --> 01:29:16.800 align:start position:0%
has no chance of survival they're at
 
01:29:18.530 --> 01:29:18.540 align:start position:0%
risk of being charged with a class a
 
01:29:18.540 --> 01:29:19.669 align:start position:0%
risk of being charged with a class a
felony

01:29:19.669 --> 01:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
felony
 
01:29:21.590 --> 01:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
please allow New Hampshire families to
 
01:29:23.270 --> 01:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
make these end-of-life neonatal
 
01:29:25.129 --> 01:29:25.139 align:start position:0%
decisions in consultation with their
 
01:29:27.410 --> 01:29:27.420 align:start position:0%
Medical Teams based on evidence-based
 
01:29:29.689 --> 01:29:29.699 align:start position:0%
medicine without the intrusion of the
 
01:29:31.310 --> 01:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire government to dictate how
 
01:29:33.470 --> 01:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
they spend their final moments together
 
01:29:35.209 --> 01:29:35.219 align:start position:0%
please trust women and families and
 
01:29:36.830 --> 01:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
their doctors to make these incredibly
 
01:29:39.290 --> 01:29:39.300 align:start position:0%
difficult decisions together and vote
 
01:29:43.370 --> 01:29:43.380 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate on HB 346 just
 
01:29:45.290 --> 01:29:45.300 align:start position:0%
two points I'd specifically like to make
 
01:29:47.209 --> 01:29:47.219 align:start position:0%
I think as the physician having the lens
 
01:29:50.930 --> 01:29:50.940 align:start position:0%
to read this bill one is that I've heard
 
01:29:52.550 --> 01:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
a lot about the intent of the bill
 
01:29:55.790 --> 01:29:55.800 align:start position:0%
there's intent and there's reality as I
 
01:29:58.189 --> 01:29:58.199 align:start position:0%
sit and look at this bill it is vague
 
01:30:00.110 --> 01:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
and it is problematic and it will harm
 
01:30:01.970 --> 01:30:01.980 align:start position:0%
the families that you heard have heard
 
01:30:04.370 --> 01:30:04.380 align:start position:0%
from today about these Comfort Care
 
01:30:04.380 --> 01:30:05.629 align:start position:0%
from today about these Comfort Care
decisions

01:30:05.629 --> 01:30:05.639 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
01:30:08.330 --> 01:30:08.340 align:start position:0%
we've referenced as far as under the
 
01:30:10.430 --> 01:30:10.440 align:start position:0%
criminal penalties as I read directly
 
01:30:12.649 --> 01:30:12.659 align:start position:0%
from the bill any health care provider
 
01:30:14.570 --> 01:30:14.580 align:start position:0%
who withholds medical treatment from a
 
01:30:17.209 --> 01:30:17.219 align:start position:0%
born alive infant with the intention of
 
01:30:19.550 --> 01:30:19.560 align:start position:0%
causing or hastening the infant's death
 
01:30:22.790 --> 01:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
as I read this as a physician
 
01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:24.530 align:start position:0%
as I read this as a physician
not

01:30:24.530 --> 01:30:24.540 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:30:28.570 --> 01:30:28.580 align:start position:0%
giving these invasive procedures is
 
01:30:33.290 --> 01:30:33.300 align:start position:0%
hastening the death so it's just vague
 
01:30:35.750 --> 01:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
and it's not straightforward as far as a
 
01:30:37.850 --> 01:30:37.860 align:start position:0%
physician or again any health care
 
01:30:39.709 --> 01:30:39.719 align:start position:0%
provider which encompasses a lot of
 
01:30:43.070 --> 01:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
providers not doing these invasive
 
01:30:43.080 --> 01:30:44.810 align:start position:0%
providers not doing these invasive
procedures

01:30:44.810 --> 01:30:44.820 align:start position:0%
procedures
 
01:30:47.390 --> 01:30:47.400 align:start position:0%
is hastening the death we will feel like
 
01:30:49.910 --> 01:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
we have to take that baby from these
 
01:30:52.729 --> 01:30:52.739 align:start position:0%
families who want this time or there's a
 
01:30:55.729 --> 01:30:55.739 align:start position:0%
class a felony these are really grave
 
01:30:59.570 --> 01:30:59.580 align:start position:0%
consequences to providers who are all
 
01:31:01.430 --> 01:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
really just trying to do the best thing
 
01:31:04.070 --> 01:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
for our patients and family so I just
 
01:31:06.229 --> 01:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that as a physician
 
01:31:08.030 --> 01:31:08.040 align:start position:0%
lens reading this that I try to make
 
01:31:10.310 --> 01:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
that clear that by not doing those
 
01:31:12.290 --> 01:31:12.300 align:start position:0%
things we do feel like we would be
 
01:31:14.990 --> 01:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
hastening the death thank you for your
 
01:31:17.450 --> 01:31:17.460 align:start position:0%
time questions for this witness uh yes
 
01:31:19.490 --> 01:31:19.500 align:start position:0%
representative Perez
 
01:31:21.470 --> 01:31:21.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony as a
 
01:31:24.649 --> 01:31:24.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:28.610 --> 01:31:28.620 align:start position:0%
how do we protect how do you see we
 
01:31:28.620 --> 01:31:29.750 align:start position:0%
how do we protect how do you see we
protect

01:31:29.750 --> 01:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
protect
 
01:31:35.870 --> 01:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:35.880 --> 01:31:37.610 align:start position:0%
 
child

01:31:37.610 --> 01:31:37.620 align:start position:0%
child
 
01:31:41.390 --> 01:31:41.400 align:start position:0%
that has been aborted alive how do we
 
01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:42.410 align:start position:0%
that has been aborted alive how do we
protect

01:31:42.410 --> 01:31:42.420 align:start position:0%
protect
 
01:31:45.169 --> 01:31:45.179 align:start position:0%
them the healthy
 
01:31:49.610 --> 01:31:49.620 align:start position:0%
22 23 18 weeks we they survive at 18
 
01:31:51.290 --> 01:31:51.300 align:start position:0%
weeks now
 
01:31:55.070 --> 01:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
of a failed abortion how do we protect
 
01:31:55.080 --> 01:31:57.169 align:start position:0%
of a failed abortion how do we protect
them

01:31:57.169 --> 01:31:57.179 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:31:59.450 --> 01:31:59.460 align:start position:0%
and you could say that no doctor would
 
01:32:01.430 --> 01:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
not try to
 
01:32:04.010 --> 01:32:04.020 align:start position:0%
but it's the same as saying an intent
 
01:32:05.990 --> 01:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
and a reality but what I'd like to
 
01:32:08.030 --> 01:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
Circle back to is this bill and this
 
01:32:09.950 --> 01:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
bill the way it's written
 
01:32:12.830 --> 01:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
will not be straightforward to implement
 
01:32:16.910 --> 01:32:16.920 align:start position:0%
and so again we are here to really talk
 
01:32:18.830 --> 01:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
about or I would like to just keep
 
01:32:22.870 --> 01:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
focusing back on this bill as far as the
 
01:32:25.850 --> 01:32:25.860 align:start position:0%
vagueness of the language and the harm
 
01:32:27.169 --> 01:32:27.179 align:start position:0%
that it could bring to New Hampshire
 
01:32:29.510 --> 01:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
families thank you
 
01:32:31.669 --> 01:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
other questions for this witness yes
 
01:32:31.679 --> 01:32:49.250 align:start position:0%
other questions for this witness yes
representative

01:32:49.250 --> 01:32:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:51.530 --> 01:32:51.540 align:start position:0%
do you think that if the bill were to be
 
01:32:53.810 --> 01:32:53.820 align:start position:0%
amended to say
 
01:32:55.850 --> 01:32:55.860 align:start position:0%
um to give an exception for in the case
 
01:32:58.669 --> 01:32:58.679 align:start position:0%
of in the reasonable medical Judgment of
 
01:33:01.450 --> 01:33:01.460 align:start position:0%
a physician that
 
01:33:04.189 --> 01:33:04.199 align:start position:0%
the baby was born with a fatal fetal
 
01:33:08.229 --> 01:33:08.239 align:start position:0%
anomaly or an anomaly
 
01:33:10.729 --> 01:33:10.739 align:start position:0%
significantly impacting the quality of
 
01:33:10.739 --> 01:33:13.669 align:start position:0%
significantly impacting the quality of
life

01:33:13.669 --> 01:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:16.850 --> 01:33:16.860 align:start position:0%
um that this would
 
01:33:20.209 --> 01:33:20.219 align:start position:0%
allow mothers the opportunity to
 
01:33:22.070 --> 01:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
hold their babies as in the in the cases
 
01:33:23.149 --> 01:33:23.159 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about that are having
 
01:33:24.709 --> 01:33:24.719 align:start position:0%
to make painful decisions but would
 
01:33:27.709 --> 01:33:27.719 align:start position:0%
still protect
 
01:33:30.530 --> 01:33:30.540 align:start position:0%
a baby that was born alive and was
 
01:33:35.870 --> 01:33:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:37.970 --> 01:33:37.980 align:start position:0%
I think there's no language that we
 
01:33:39.649 --> 01:33:39.659 align:start position:0%
could come up with from both sides of
 
01:33:41.629 --> 01:33:41.639 align:start position:0%
the aisle that could touch upon these
 
01:33:45.110 --> 01:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
very complicated personal decisions and
 
01:33:47.330 --> 01:33:47.340 align:start position:0%
ultimately I go back to the fact that
 
01:33:49.550 --> 01:33:49.560 align:start position:0%
any infant born currently receives what
 
01:33:51.470 --> 01:33:51.480 align:start position:0%
is within the standard of care for that
 
01:33:55.129 --> 01:33:55.139 align:start position:0%
situation to let Physicians providers of
 
01:33:57.830 --> 01:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
obstetric newborn care any care just
 
01:33:57.840 --> 01:33:59.270 align:start position:0%
obstetric newborn care any care just
have

01:33:59.270 --> 01:33:59.280 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:34:01.850 --> 01:34:01.860 align:start position:0%
that trusted relationship
 
01:34:03.410 --> 01:34:03.420 align:start position:0%
um so I don't think there's any language
 
01:34:05.629 --> 01:34:05.639 align:start position:0%
that would be able to cover all the
 
01:34:11.629 --> 01:34:11.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:13.790 --> 01:34:13.800 align:start position:0%
other questions for this witness so I
 
01:34:18.350 --> 01:34:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:20.750 --> 01:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
thanks Mr chairman and and thanks for
 
01:34:22.610 --> 01:34:22.620 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
01:34:25.669 --> 01:34:25.679 align:start position:0%
um are you aware of any provisions I I
 
01:34:27.470 --> 01:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
know I'm not going to ask you about the
 
01:34:29.689 --> 01:34:29.699 align:start position:0%
legal aspects but from a medical
 
01:34:31.910 --> 01:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
standpoint from your Hippocratic Oath
 
01:34:34.669 --> 01:34:34.679 align:start position:0%
standards of care Etc that provide a
 
01:34:37.430 --> 01:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
different course of action for an abort
 
01:34:40.129 --> 01:34:40.139 align:start position:0%
an aborted fetus versus an any other
 
01:34:43.189 --> 01:34:43.199 align:start position:0%
fetus that you or not fetus but but an
 
01:34:43.199 --> 01:34:44.270 align:start position:0%
fetus that you or not fetus but but an
infant

01:34:44.270 --> 01:34:44.280 align:start position:0%
infant
 
01:34:45.890 --> 01:34:45.900 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
01:34:47.870 --> 01:34:47.880 align:start position:0%
that would that would cause you to act
 
01:34:47.880 --> 01:34:49.310 align:start position:0%
that would that would cause you to act
differently

01:34:49.310 --> 01:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
differently
 
01:34:52.310 --> 01:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
um as a as a clinician in terms of the
 
01:34:54.530 --> 01:34:54.540 align:start position:0%
course of care that that you would
 
01:34:54.540 --> 01:34:56.090 align:start position:0%
course of care that that you would
render

01:34:56.090 --> 01:34:56.100 align:start position:0%
render
 
01:34:58.610 --> 01:34:58.620 align:start position:0%
again that's a very complex decision and
 
01:35:01.250 --> 01:35:01.260 align:start position:0%
so much depends on what the clinical
 
01:35:02.870 --> 01:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
care is that's happening what
 
01:35:05.689 --> 01:35:05.699 align:start position:0%
information we know about that Mom that
 
01:35:07.610 --> 01:35:07.620 align:start position:0%
fetus that gestational age these are
 
01:35:10.370 --> 01:35:10.380 align:start position:0%
just questions that are really uh almost
 
01:35:13.729 --> 01:35:13.739 align:start position:0%
impossible uh to answer but ultimately
 
01:35:16.250 --> 01:35:16.260 align:start position:0%
we'll go back to as Physicians and
 
01:35:17.810 --> 01:35:17.820 align:start position:0%
health care providers we're going to do
 
01:35:20.930 --> 01:35:20.940 align:start position:0%
everything we can to save a newborn that
 
01:35:24.709 --> 01:35:24.719 align:start position:0%
is We Believe can survive
 
01:35:24.719 --> 01:35:27.169 align:start position:0%
is We Believe can survive
representative

01:35:27.169 --> 01:35:27.179 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:35:29.930 --> 01:35:29.940 align:start position:0%
what if it was amended to say within the
 
01:35:31.910 --> 01:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
standard of care because that is the
 
01:35:35.149 --> 01:35:35.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:38.149 --> 01:35:38.159 align:start position:0%
again I think this
 
01:35:40.910 --> 01:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
this bill or I don't I just don't think
 
01:35:43.550 --> 01:35:43.560 align:start position:0%
there's any addendum to the bill that
 
01:35:46.189 --> 01:35:46.199 align:start position:0%
would be able to cover all the things
 
01:35:50.930 --> 01:35:50.940 align:start position:0%
that ultimately uh are hard to
 
01:35:50.940 --> 01:35:53.330 align:start position:0%
that ultimately uh are hard to
protect

01:35:53.330 --> 01:35:53.340 align:start position:0%
protect
 
01:35:57.530 --> 01:35:57.540 align:start position:0%
our families and and newborns
 
01:36:00.850 --> 01:36:00.860 align:start position:0%
so I I other I'm sorry other questions
 
01:36:04.070 --> 01:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
so I guess I wonder if I could ask this
 
01:36:05.629 --> 01:36:05.639 align:start position:0%
question and you talked about the
 
01:36:07.189 --> 01:36:07.199 align:start position:0%
standard of care a number of times and
 
01:36:10.370 --> 01:36:10.380 align:start position:0%
so I what I'm kind of wondering is this
 
01:36:13.850 --> 01:36:13.860 align:start position:0%
suppose you have the situation
 
01:36:18.050 --> 01:36:18.060 align:start position:0%
of uh of a woman who comes in and to
 
01:36:20.270 --> 01:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
have an abortion at let's say 18 or 20
 
01:36:22.790 --> 01:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
weeks or whatever the woman wants the
 
01:36:24.229 --> 01:36:24.239 align:start position:0%
abortion and I want to make it clear I'm
 
01:36:26.629 --> 01:36:26.639 align:start position:0%
not trying to cast any let's assume the
 
01:36:28.250 --> 01:36:28.260 align:start position:0%
woman has a very good read there's some
 
01:36:29.870 --> 01:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
some reason for having the abortion that
 
01:36:31.850 --> 01:36:31.860 align:start position:0%
we would all say is a good reason
 
01:36:33.709 --> 01:36:33.719 align:start position:0%
so if she comes in It's let's say the
 
01:36:36.110 --> 01:36:36.120 align:start position:0%
baby's 20 weeks wants to have the
 
01:36:36.120 --> 01:36:37.129 align:start position:0%
baby's 20 weeks wants to have the
abortion

01:36:37.129 --> 01:36:37.139 align:start position:0%
abortion
 
01:36:40.370 --> 01:36:40.380 align:start position:0%
that the medical people attempt to
 
01:36:42.709 --> 01:36:42.719 align:start position:0%
perform the abortion and for whatever
 
01:36:45.950 --> 01:36:45.960 align:start position:0%
reason the abortion fails and now the
 
01:36:49.310 --> 01:36:49.320 align:start position:0%
child has been delivered and Will
 
01:36:52.250 --> 01:36:52.260 align:start position:0%
Survive but the woman still says you
 
01:36:54.890 --> 01:36:54.900 align:start position:0%
know I I wanted to have this abortion
 
01:36:58.189 --> 01:36:58.199 align:start position:0%
and I still want the abortion
 
01:37:01.010 --> 01:37:01.020 align:start position:0%
but the doctor knows that the child can
 
01:37:01.020 --> 01:37:02.450 align:start position:0%
but the doctor knows that the child can
survive

01:37:02.450 --> 01:37:02.460 align:start position:0%
survive
 
01:37:05.090 --> 01:37:05.100 align:start position:0%
what what is the doctor's obligation
 
01:37:07.550 --> 01:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
under the standard of care these are
 
01:37:10.790 --> 01:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
very hypothetical situations so having
 
01:37:13.189 --> 01:37:13.199 align:start position:0%
not been in those situations I just
 
01:37:15.050 --> 01:37:15.060 align:start position:0%
can't speak to those there is no
 
01:37:17.149 --> 01:37:17.159 align:start position:0%
standard of care for that one situation
 
01:37:19.129 --> 01:37:19.139 align:start position:0%
so these are hypothetical situations
 
01:37:21.890 --> 01:37:21.900 align:start position:0%
that I don't uh
 
01:37:25.250 --> 01:37:25.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:27.110 --> 01:37:27.120 align:start position:0%
and the only other question I have is
 
01:37:29.470 --> 01:37:29.480 align:start position:0%
you as you read the language of the bill
 
01:37:32.270 --> 01:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
you read part of it you said the part
 
01:37:34.990 --> 01:37:35.000 align:start position:0%
about the Doctor Who
 
01:37:37.850 --> 01:37:37.860 align:start position:0%
uh with holes medical treatment from a
 
01:37:39.709 --> 01:37:39.719 align:start position:0%
born alive infant with the intention of
 
01:37:42.709 --> 01:37:42.719 align:start position:0%
causing causing or hastening to death
 
01:37:45.169 --> 01:37:45.179 align:start position:0%
but you didn't read the last part which
 
01:37:47.390 --> 01:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
says and who materially
 
01:37:49.669 --> 01:37:49.679 align:start position:0%
causes or Hastings to death and
 
01:37:51.709 --> 01:37:51.719 align:start position:0%
presumably the word material has to have
 
01:37:54.290 --> 01:37:54.300 align:start position:0%
some meaning so that would presumably
 
01:37:56.330 --> 01:37:56.340 align:start position:0%
mean it has to be something more than
 
01:37:58.790 --> 01:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
just a few minutes or a day or something
 
01:38:00.770 --> 01:38:00.780 align:start position:0%
like that what do you say I don't know
 
01:38:02.750 --> 01:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
what that word means material as a
 
01:38:04.310 --> 01:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
physician again with the lens reading
 
01:38:06.950 --> 01:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
this bill how I read that whole sentence
 
01:38:10.610 --> 01:38:10.620 align:start position:0%
is that if I don't Pro if or myself I'm
 
01:38:12.350 --> 01:38:12.360 align:start position:0%
not a new auditologist or pediatrician
 
01:38:16.030 --> 01:38:16.040 align:start position:0%
but the providers there who are
 
01:38:18.169 --> 01:38:18.179 align:start position:0%
responsible for the care of that newborn
 
01:38:20.810 --> 01:38:20.820 align:start position:0%
if that invasive care whatever you
 
01:38:22.490 --> 01:38:22.500 align:start position:0%
define as the invasive care isn't
 
01:38:25.250 --> 01:38:25.260 align:start position:0%
provided then that provider is hastening
 
01:38:28.090 --> 01:38:28.100 align:start position:0%
or causing the death of the newborn
 
01:38:31.790 --> 01:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
other questions for this Witness
 
01:38:33.830 --> 01:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
sorry representative page
 
01:38:35.689 --> 01:38:35.699 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thanks for taking my
 
01:38:38.629 --> 01:38:38.639 align:start position:0%
question I am still struggling with
 
01:38:41.930 --> 01:38:41.940 align:start position:0%
translating our legal words to the
 
01:38:43.970 --> 01:38:43.980 align:start position:0%
medical profession struggled with it
 
01:38:45.649 --> 01:38:45.659 align:start position:0%
yesterday and I'm struggling with it
 
01:38:45.659 --> 01:38:46.669 align:start position:0%
yesterday and I'm struggling with it
today

01:38:46.669 --> 01:38:46.679 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:38:49.850 --> 01:38:49.860 align:start position:0%
but I am wondering and
 
01:38:53.390 --> 01:38:53.400 align:start position:0%
sometimes I don't trust lawyers
 
01:38:56.870 --> 01:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
the words that the way they can use
 
01:38:59.629 --> 01:38:59.639 align:start position:0%
situations for their training right in
 
01:39:01.250 --> 01:39:01.260 align:start position:0%
their context of their training and I'm
 
01:39:03.229 --> 01:39:03.239 align:start position:0%
wondering I should say I don't trust
 
01:39:04.610 --> 01:39:04.620 align:start position:0%
them but I can see that their training
 
01:39:05.629 --> 01:39:05.639 align:start position:0%
may lead
 
01:39:09.290 --> 01:39:09.300 align:start position:0%
to a situation that is kind of counter
 
01:39:13.430 --> 01:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
to your training so I'm wondering if
 
01:39:16.729 --> 01:39:16.739 align:start position:0%
somewhere in now that you know if this
 
01:39:20.510 --> 01:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
was to become if somewhere in your
 
01:39:22.729 --> 01:39:22.739 align:start position:0%
knowledge of these words
 
01:39:24.770 --> 01:39:24.780 align:start position:0%
about what they mean to you as a
 
01:39:26.570 --> 01:39:26.580 align:start position:0%
practicing physician whether you're
 
01:39:28.910 --> 01:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
materially causing an Omission that
 
01:39:31.490 --> 01:39:31.500 align:start position:0%
material causes materially causes or
 
01:39:33.110 --> 01:39:33.120 align:start position:0%
Hastings to death
 
01:39:34.930 --> 01:39:34.940 align:start position:0%
does that
 
01:39:38.510 --> 01:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
interfere with the standard of care in
 
01:39:40.129 --> 01:39:40.139 align:start position:0%
some way in the back of your mind
 
01:39:43.850 --> 01:39:43.860 align:start position:0%
perhaps what it interfere as you're sort
 
01:39:45.530 --> 01:39:45.540 align:start position:0%
of thinking about this and trying to
 
01:39:48.050 --> 01:39:48.060 align:start position:0%
deliver medical treatment under a
 
01:39:49.310 --> 01:39:49.320 align:start position:0%
standard of care does it almost
 
01:39:53.270 --> 01:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
undermine it in a way yes if this bill
 
01:39:55.430 --> 01:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
were to pass then
 
01:39:58.129 --> 01:39:58.139 align:start position:0%
there would be very
 
01:40:01.189 --> 01:40:01.199 align:start position:0%
impossible for us to not
 
01:40:04.129 --> 01:40:04.139 align:start position:0%
feel that we had to ultimately yes it
 
01:40:05.810 --> 01:40:05.820 align:start position:0%
would undermine our care and that
 
01:40:08.510 --> 01:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
trusted relationship and and for what we
 
01:40:11.330 --> 01:40:11.340 align:start position:0%
would want to do for our families
 
01:40:13.850 --> 01:40:13.860 align:start position:0%

penalties specified in the bill
 
01:45:04.970 --> 01:45:04.980 align:start position:0%
additionally a clear and accurate
 
01:45:07.310 --> 01:45:07.320 align:start position:0%
definition of born live infant is
 
01:45:10.370 --> 01:45:10.380 align:start position:0%
provided ultimately his legislation
 
01:45:12.890 --> 01:45:12.900 align:start position:0%
aligns with a common sense of granite
 
01:45:15.770 --> 01:45:15.780 align:start position:0%
Staters and Americans across the country
 
01:45:19.189 --> 01:45:19.199 align:start position:0%
we know the meaning of a born alive
 
01:45:21.709 --> 01:45:21.719 align:start position:0%
infant it means the potential for a long
 
01:45:24.229 --> 01:45:24.239 align:start position:0%
and wonderful life but only if these
 
01:45:25.850 --> 01:45:25.860 align:start position:0%
infants are protected
 
01:45:28.129 --> 01:45:28.139 align:start position:0%
as the only organization in the world
 
01:45:30.830 --> 01:45:30.840 align:start position:0%
supporting abortion survivors and their
 
01:45:33.590 --> 01:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
families we have come into contact with
 
01:45:36.770 --> 01:45:36.780 align:start position:0%
hundreds of individuals born during or
 
01:45:39.290 --> 01:45:39.300 align:start position:0%
following a failed abortion
 
01:45:41.750 --> 01:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
while records of abortion survivors in
 
01:45:43.550 --> 01:45:43.560 align:start position:0%
the United States are either missing or
 
01:45:47.450 --> 01:45:47.460 align:start position:0%
woefully incomplete ASN has been able to
 
01:45:50.090 --> 01:45:50.100 align:start position:0%
estimate by extrapolating from Canadian
 
01:45:52.790 --> 01:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
rates the actual number and frequency of
 
01:45:55.189 --> 01:45:55.199 align:start position:0%
abortion survivors and born alive
 
01:45:57.770 --> 01:45:57.780 align:start position:0%
abortions in the United States
 
01:46:02.629 --> 01:46:02.639 align:start position:0%
our Research indicates that 0.21 of
 
01:46:05.510 --> 01:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
abortions result in a live birth this
 
01:46:06.950 --> 01:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
means that for every one thousand
 
01:46:09.169 --> 01:46:09.179 align:start position:0%
abortions approximately two infants
 
01:46:09.179 --> 01:46:10.609 align:start position:0%
abortions approximately two infants
survive

01:46:10.609 --> 01:46:10.619 align:start position:0%
survive
 
01:46:12.830 --> 01:46:12.840 align:start position:0%
based on the large number of abortions
 
01:46:14.450 --> 01:46:14.460 align:start position:0%
performed Nationwide
 
01:46:16.270 --> 01:46:16.280 align:start position:0%
an average of
 
01:46:19.669 --> 01:46:19.679 align:start position:0%
1734 failed abortions result in a live
 
01:46:21.109 --> 01:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
birth every year
 
01:46:23.870 --> 01:46:23.880 align:start position:0%
this occurrence is not as rare as many
 
01:46:26.629 --> 01:46:26.639 align:start position:0%
try to claim each Survivor is a
 
01:46:28.790 --> 01:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
testimony not only of the occurrence of
 
01:46:31.370 --> 01:46:31.380 align:start position:0%
failed abortions but of the value of
 
01:46:33.649 --> 01:46:33.659 align:start position:0%
every born alive infant
 
01:46:35.629 --> 01:46:35.639 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire born alive infant
 
01:46:38.149 --> 01:46:38.159 align:start position:0%
protection act will save countless lives
 
01:46:43.189 --> 01:46:43.199 align:start position:0%
lives like mine in 1977 my birth mother
 
01:46:46.370 --> 01:46:46.380 align:start position:0%
had a Salient infusion abortion forced
 
01:46:48.649 --> 01:46:48.659 align:start position:0%
upon her by my grandmother
 
01:46:51.290 --> 01:46:51.300 align:start position:0%
this procedure involved injecting a
 
01:46:53.750 --> 01:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
toxic salt solution into the amniotic
 
01:46:57.050 --> 01:46:57.060 align:start position:0%
fluid meant to protect my body to scald
 
01:46:59.870 --> 01:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
and poison me to death despite all
 
01:47:02.750 --> 01:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
expectations I was born alive
 
01:47:05.689 --> 01:47:05.699 align:start position:0%
even after being miraculously born alive
 
01:47:08.510 --> 01:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
I was left to die outside the womb
 
01:47:12.290 --> 01:47:12.300 align:start position:0%
however I was rescued by a nurse who
 
01:47:14.930 --> 01:47:14.940 align:start position:0%
disobeyed orders to lamia side and
 
01:47:19.010 --> 01:47:19.020 align:start position:0%
rushed me to the NICU my medical records
 
01:47:22.070 --> 01:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
note that an abortion was performed and
 
01:47:23.570 --> 01:47:23.580 align:start position:0%
but failed
 
01:47:26.570 --> 01:47:26.580 align:start position:0%
at ASN stories like mine
 
01:47:28.490 --> 01:47:28.500 align:start position:0%
are not so rare
 
01:47:30.830 --> 01:47:30.840 align:start position:0%
many abortion survivors have been left
 
01:47:33.350 --> 01:47:33.360 align:start position:0%
uncared for even after their initial
 
01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:34.430 align:start position:0%

survival
 
01:47:37.910 --> 01:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
whether an infant receives life-saving
 
01:47:40.010 --> 01:47:40.020 align:start position:0%
care should not depend on who is working
 
01:47:41.750 --> 01:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
that day
 
01:47:44.209 --> 01:47:44.219 align:start position:0%
ASN is committed to serving and
 
01:47:46.850 --> 01:47:46.860 align:start position:0%
protecting the survivors of abortion at
 
01:47:49.550 --> 01:47:49.560 align:start position:0%
any age let us work together to ensure
 
01:47:51.470 --> 01:47:51.480 align:start position:0%
that infants are protected in a common

sense way
 
01:47:55.430 --> 01:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
as the first and most fundamental right
 
01:47:58.250 --> 01:47:58.260 align:start position:0%
life should never be denied no matter

how young an individual is or how unique

the circumstances of their birth
 
01:48:06.590 --> 01:48:06.600 align:start position:0%
survivors deserve the same care and
 
01:48:08.510 --> 01:48:08.520 align:start position:0%
treatment as everyone else
 
01:48:10.850 --> 01:48:10.860 align:start position:0%

in the state
 
01:49:36.950 --> 01:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
as a formative part of my training for
 
01:49:38.750 --> 01:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
becoming a pastor I volunteered at a
 
01:49:42.229 --> 01:49:42.239 align:start position:0%
trauma level one hospital as a Chaplain
 
01:49:44.930 --> 01:49:44.940 align:start position:0%
I ask you to vote in opposition of house
 
01:49:47.270 --> 01:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
bill 346.
 
01:49:50.030 --> 01:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
as a citizen I'm troubled that there is
 
01:49:51.770 --> 01:49:51.780 align:start position:0%
a bill before you that could criminalize
 
01:49:54.169 --> 01:49:54.179 align:start position:0%
doctors as we are a country and state in
 
01:49:56.629 --> 01:49:56.639 align:start position:0%
need of doctors
 
01:49:59.330 --> 01:49:59.340 align:start position:0%
in Ministry often in hospital settings
 
01:50:02.330 --> 01:50:02.340 align:start position:0%
I've accompanied people in moments of
 
01:50:04.970 --> 01:50:04.980 align:start position:0%
deep celebration as well as moments of
 
01:50:06.350 --> 01:50:06.360 align:start position:0%
deep grief
 
01:50:08.689 --> 01:50:08.699 align:start position:0%
hard and painful moments
 
01:50:10.550 --> 01:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
I've seen many people in their last
 
01:50:10.560 --> 01:50:11.990 align:start position:0%
I've seen many people in their last
moments

01:50:11.990 --> 01:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
moments
 
01:50:14.090 --> 01:50:14.100 align:start position:0%
and those moments do not just belong to
 
01:50:15.649 --> 01:50:15.659 align:start position:0%
the individuals they belong to the
 
01:50:15.659 --> 01:50:17.990 align:start position:0%
the individuals they belong to the
families

01:50:17.990 --> 01:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
families
 
01:50:19.910 --> 01:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
of course I always try my best to care
 
01:50:21.050 --> 01:50:21.060 align:start position:0%
for people who are experiencing
 
01:50:24.169 --> 01:50:24.179 align:start position:0%
emotional spiritual and mental pain
 
01:50:26.930 --> 01:50:26.940 align:start position:0%
sometimes I can only sit and be with
 
01:50:28.930 --> 01:50:28.940 align:start position:0%
people who are struggling
 
01:50:31.370 --> 01:50:31.380 align:start position:0%
Guardians never
 
01:50:35.350 --> 01:50:35.360 align:start position:0%
want to cause their children pain
 
01:50:39.169 --> 01:50:39.179 align:start position:0%
unfortunately sometimes parents need to
 
01:50:42.649 --> 01:50:42.659 align:start position:0%
make decisions alongside care providers
 
01:50:44.990 --> 01:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
parents need to be able to count on care
 
01:50:47.810 --> 01:50:47.820 align:start position:0%
providers to give them the best medical
 
01:50:47.820 --> 01:50:50.090 align:start position:0%
providers to give them the best medical
advice

01:50:50.090 --> 01:50:50.100 align:start position:0%
advice
 
01:50:53.390 --> 01:50:53.400 align:start position:0%
House Bill 346 is not necessary and
 
01:50:56.209 --> 01:50:56.219 align:start position:0%
could have devastating consequences on
 
01:50:59.570 --> 01:50:59.580 align:start position:0%
families who are grieving the loss of a

newborn
 
01:51:04.490 --> 01:51:04.500 align:start position:0%

fatal fetal diagnosis
 
01:51:09.050 --> 01:51:09.060 align:start position:0%
these are situations that are impossible
 
01:51:11.090 --> 01:51:11.100 align:start position:0%
to change the outcome of
 
01:51:13.310 --> 01:51:13.320 align:start position:0%
Health Care Providers face steep
 
01:51:15.470 --> 01:51:15.480 align:start position:0%
consequences if they are withholding
 
01:51:17.330 --> 01:51:17.340 align:start position:0%
care even if they are providing

hospice care
 
01:51:24.830 --> 01:51:24.840 align:start position:0%
in this situation the parent should be
 
01:51:29.030 --> 01:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
able to decide how the infant's moments
 
01:51:30.410 --> 01:51:30.420 align:start position:0%
will be spent
 
01:51:32.750 --> 01:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
care providers should be able able to
 
01:51:35.270 --> 01:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
offer compassion to the family that's
 
01:51:38.209 --> 01:51:38.219 align:start position:0%
what they signed up for
 
01:51:40.430 --> 01:51:40.440 align:start position:0%
this bill could take away the parents
 
01:51:42.709 --> 01:51:42.719 align:start position:0%
right to decide how they would spend the
 
01:51:45.310 --> 01:51:45.320 align:start position:0%
last moments with their newborn
 
01:51:45.320 --> 01:51:46.930 align:start position:0%

Faithfully spiritually
 
01:51:53.090 --> 01:51:53.100 align:start position:0%
this would mean taking away important
 
01:51:55.729 --> 01:51:55.739 align:start position:0%
Sacrament and ritual
 
01:51:59.209 --> 01:51:59.219 align:start position:0%
it would not be right to deny families
 
01:52:02.990 --> 01:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to baptize their child
 
01:52:06.830 --> 01:52:06.840 align:start position:0%
a child who would be actively dying
 
01:52:08.570 --> 01:52:08.580 align:start position:0%
it would be an infringement on their
 
01:52:10.490 --> 01:52:10.500 align:start position:0%
religious beliefs
 
01:52:13.850 --> 01:52:13.860 align:start position:0%
this bill will deny Comfort to those who
 
01:52:16.970 --> 01:52:16.980 align:start position:0%
will already be traumatized
 
01:52:19.310 --> 01:52:19.320 align:start position:0%
I hope that you will reject this
 
01:52:21.649 --> 01:52:21.659 align:start position:0%
dangerous and unsympathetic Bill and
 
01:52:23.870 --> 01:52:23.880 align:start position:0%
vote and expedition to legislate on
 
01:52:26.930 --> 01:52:26.940 align:start position:0%
House Bill 346. thank you thank you
 
01:52:29.810 --> 01:52:29.820 align:start position:0%

01:52:41.689 --> 01:52:41.699 align:start position:0%
and after that the next witness will be
 
01:52:44.570 --> 01:52:44.580 align:start position:0%

01:52:46.430 --> 01:52:46.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
01:52:48.050 --> 01:52:48.060 align:start position:0%
committee can you hear me okay
 
01:52:50.689 --> 01:52:50.699 align:start position:0%
thank you Ian Hewitt general counsel at
 
01:52:53.030 --> 01:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
Cornerstone we are not taking a position
 
01:52:55.070 --> 01:52:55.080 align:start position:0%
on this bill this year but I wanted to
 
01:52:56.689 --> 01:52:56.699 align:start position:0%
make myself available to answer any
 
01:52:59.270 --> 01:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
legal questions about it the text of
 
01:53:00.709 --> 01:53:00.719 align:start position:0%
Representative cordelli's Bill
 
01:53:03.410 --> 01:53:03.420 align:start position:0%
originated as a floor excuse me a
 
01:53:05.570 --> 01:53:05.580 align:start position:0%
committee Amendment brought by Senator
 
01:53:07.910 --> 01:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
Regina bird cell in the Senate Judiciary
 
01:53:10.370 --> 01:53:10.380 align:start position:0%
Committee in the last session to the
 
01:53:13.070 --> 01:53:13.080 align:start position:0%
last sessions for an alive the text of
 
01:53:14.689 --> 01:53:14.699 align:start position:0%
that amendment was developed in
 
01:53:16.669 --> 01:53:16.679 align:start position:0%
consultation with law professors who are
 
01:53:19.370 --> 01:53:19.380 align:start position:0%
subject matter experts in this area and
 
01:53:21.530 --> 01:53:21.540 align:start position:0%
volunteered their time to redraft the
 
01:53:23.689 --> 01:53:23.699 align:start position:0%
previous foreign alive Bill and it was
 
01:53:26.990 --> 01:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
redrafted specifically to avoid the main
 
01:53:29.030 --> 01:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
criticism that was heard against this
 
01:53:30.890 --> 01:53:30.900 align:start position:0%
bill in the house in the last session
 
01:53:33.709 --> 01:53:33.719 align:start position:0%
which concerns stories like the story of
 
01:53:36.470 --> 01:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
baby Sawyer who you heard today where
 
01:53:39.350 --> 01:53:39.360 align:start position:0%
people were concerned that the bill at
 
01:53:41.510 --> 01:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
that time would require feudal treatment
 
01:53:44.209 --> 01:53:44.219 align:start position:0%
be administered to a baby about to die
 
01:53:46.550 --> 01:53:46.560 align:start position:0%
if the baby be pulled from its mother's
 
01:53:49.490 --> 01:53:49.500 align:start position:0%
arms to receive this feudal in its
 
01:53:51.850 --> 01:53:51.860 align:start position:0%
current form this bill only prohibits
 
01:53:54.530 --> 01:53:54.540 align:start position:0%
actually causing or hastening the death
 
01:53:57.350 --> 01:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
of the infant and intentionally and
 
01:53:59.330 --> 01:53:59.340 align:start position:0%
materially causing or Hasting the
 
01:54:02.390 --> 01:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
infant's death I've done criminal trial
 
01:54:04.669 --> 01:54:04.679 align:start position:0%
practice on both sides prosecution and
 
01:54:06.950 --> 01:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
defense and then a trial court clerk as
 
01:54:09.410 --> 01:54:09.420 align:start position:0%
well and I expect this fact is already
 
01:54:11.629 --> 01:54:11.639 align:start position:0%
familiar to most of you but not only in
 
01:54:13.669 --> 01:54:13.679 align:start position:0%
a criminal prosecution does the
 
01:54:15.169 --> 01:54:15.179 align:start position:0%
government need to prove the overall
 
01:54:17.450 --> 01:54:17.460 align:start position:0%
case Beyond A Reasonable Doubt the
 
01:54:19.430 --> 01:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
government must prove each element of
 
01:54:21.950 --> 01:54:21.960 align:start position:0%
the offense Beyond A Reasonable Doubt so
 
01:54:24.470 --> 01:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
in any prosecution under this bill the
 
01:54:26.330 --> 01:54:26.340 align:start position:0%
defense attorney would remind the jury
 
01:54:29.689 --> 01:54:29.699 align:start position:0%
remember the state's burden is to prove
 
01:54:33.109 --> 01:54:33.119 align:start position:0%
that Dr Johnson materially caused or
 
01:54:35.270 --> 01:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
hastened the infant's death that Dr
 
01:54:38.030 --> 01:54:38.040 align:start position:0%
Johnson did so intentionally and if you
 
01:54:39.950 --> 01:54:39.960 align:start position:0%
have any doubt Reasonable Doubt is to
 
01:54:42.109 --> 01:54:42.119 align:start position:0%
either element of that offense you must
 
01:54:44.990 --> 01:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
acquit Dr Johnson the judge would then
 
01:54:47.570 --> 01:54:47.580 align:start position:0%
issue instructions to the jury saying if
 
01:54:49.729 --> 01:54:49.739 align:start position:0%
you have Reasonable Doubt as to any
 
01:54:52.490 --> 01:54:52.500 align:start position:0%
element of this offense caused or haste
 
01:54:54.590 --> 01:54:54.600 align:start position:0%
it intentionally material you must
 
01:54:57.890 --> 01:54:57.900 align:start position:0%
acquit the accused doctor so I'll just
 
01:55:00.169 --> 01:55:00.179 align:start position:0%
conclude by saying you know following
 
01:55:02.629 --> 01:55:02.639 align:start position:0%
the discussions on this bill I have been
 
01:55:05.990 --> 01:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not surprised to hear people say
 
01:55:08.990 --> 01:55:09.000 align:start position:0%
that this bill is unnecessary or is
 
01:55:10.850 --> 01:55:10.860 align:start position:0%
insulting to doctors I think some
 
01:55:12.590 --> 01:55:12.600 align:start position:0%
lawyers probably feel that way about
 
01:55:14.510 --> 01:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
some of the regulations that regulate
 
01:55:16.850 --> 01:55:16.860 align:start position:0%
lawyers specifically but I have been
 
01:55:18.530 --> 01:55:18.540 align:start position:0%
probably somewhat surprised at the
 
01:55:20.870 --> 01:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
number of people saying that it might be
 
01:55:22.910 --> 01:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
part of a appropriate Medical Practice
 
01:55:25.850 --> 01:55:25.860 align:start position:0%
to ever do anything that this bill
 
01:55:28.250 --> 01:55:28.260 align:start position:0%
prescribes I think that should probably
 
01:55:30.229 --> 01:55:30.239 align:start position:0%
send up red flags for this committee and
 
01:55:31.729 --> 01:55:31.739 align:start position:0%
I hope the committee will continue to
 
01:55:34.550 --> 01:55:34.560 align:start position:0%
take important testimony about that line
 
01:55:36.169 --> 01:55:36.179 align:start position:0%
of argument thank you and I'd be happy
 
01:55:38.209 --> 01:55:38.219 align:start position:0%
to answer any legal questions about the
 
01:55:41.330 --> 01:55:41.340 align:start position:0%
bill questions for this Witness
 
01:55:43.790 --> 01:55:43.800 align:start position:0%
yes representative Stapleton
 
01:55:45.590 --> 01:55:45.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:55:47.330 --> 01:55:47.340 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:55:51.790 --> 01:55:51.800 align:start position:0%
if we were to enumerate multiple
 
01:55:54.890 --> 01:55:54.900 align:start position:0%
exceptions or situations
 
01:55:57.290 --> 01:55:57.300 align:start position:0%
um like we have talked about and heard
 
01:55:57.300 --> 01:55:59.390 align:start position:0%
um like we have talked about and heard
here

01:55:59.390 --> 01:55:59.400 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:56:02.149 --> 01:56:02.159 align:start position:0%
aren't we actually conflicting
 
01:56:05.030 --> 01:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
the law with regard to Criminal Intent I
 
01:56:06.109 --> 01:56:06.119 align:start position:0%
mean it
 
01:56:08.450 --> 01:56:08.460 align:start position:0%
it doesn't send anybody it's apples and
 
01:56:11.510 --> 01:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
oranges is that basically could you
 
01:56:13.129 --> 01:56:13.139 align:start position:0%
repeat your question representative if
 
01:56:16.910 --> 01:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
if we were to enumerate by Amendment
 
01:56:21.310 --> 01:56:21.320 align:start position:0%
the various situations exceptions
 
01:56:25.129 --> 01:56:25.139 align:start position:0%
that some of which were discussed here
 
01:56:26.930 --> 01:56:26.940 align:start position:0%
are we not
 
01:56:31.010 --> 01:56:31.020 align:start position:0%
uh a far a basically a Chasm between
 
01:56:34.490 --> 01:56:34.500 align:start position:0%
those situations which are personal and
 
01:56:38.870 --> 01:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
life intent from the Criminal Intent
 
01:56:40.070 --> 01:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
I believe you're asking about
 
01:56:41.930 --> 01:56:41.940 align:start position:0%
enumerating some specific situations
 
01:56:45.169 --> 01:56:45.179 align:start position:0%
potentially in the bill I would say that
 
01:56:47.149 --> 01:56:47.159 align:start position:0%
that would depend on exactly what was
 
01:56:49.790 --> 01:56:49.800 align:start position:0%
enumerated if for example the bill said
 
01:56:51.649 --> 01:56:51.659 align:start position:0%
something like
 
01:56:54.770 --> 01:56:54.780 align:start position:0%
it will be a complete defense under this
 
01:56:57.729 --> 01:56:57.739 align:start position:0%
subsection If the child had a condition
 
01:57:00.350 --> 01:57:00.360 align:start position:0%
incompatible with life that would really
 
01:57:02.450 --> 01:57:02.460 align:start position:0%
not change the intent of the bill at all
 
01:57:04.430 --> 01:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
and potentially could give some comfort
 
01:57:05.930 --> 01:57:05.940 align:start position:0%
to someone who might vote for the bill
 
01:57:07.490 --> 01:57:07.500 align:start position:0%
although I really don't think it have
 
01:57:09.830 --> 01:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
any effect if you had an exception that
 
01:57:12.709 --> 01:57:12.719 align:start position:0%
said something like this protection will
 
01:57:14.390 --> 01:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
not apply in the case of a child who has
 
01:57:16.970 --> 01:57:16.980 align:start position:0%
a life-altering disability in that case
 
01:57:18.290 --> 01:57:18.300 align:start position:0%
we might have to get involved in
 
01:57:19.970 --> 01:57:19.980 align:start position:0%
opposition to the bill then you could
 
01:57:21.589 --> 01:57:21.599 align:start position:0%
potentially have for the first time a
 
01:57:23.810 --> 01:57:23.820 align:start position:0%
state statute saying that a criminal
 
01:57:26.450 --> 01:57:26.460 align:start position:0%
homicide is authorized if a child has a
 
01:57:28.669 --> 01:57:28.679 align:start position:0%
particularly life-altering condition so
 
01:57:30.169 --> 01:57:30.179 align:start position:0%
it would depend on exactly what was
 
01:57:30.179 --> 01:57:31.490 align:start position:0%
it would depend on exactly what was
enumerated

01:57:31.490 --> 01:57:31.500 align:start position:0%
enumerated
 
01:57:35.629 --> 01:57:35.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:38.450 --> 01:57:38.460 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much Chris
 
01:57:41.330 --> 01:57:41.340 align:start position:0%
Rouse and then the next uh
 
01:57:58.270 --> 01:57:58.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:01.370 --> 01:58:01.380 align:start position:0%
oh it's all here so I apologize you can
 
01:58:02.750 --> 01:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
pick that up if you watch that it makes
 
01:58:04.570 --> 01:58:04.580 align:start position:0%
it easier on the back
 
01:58:08.149 --> 01:58:08.159 align:start position:0%
Price is Right uh yeah my name is uh Dr
 
01:58:10.790 --> 01:58:10.800 align:start position:0%
Chris Ross I'm a unitologist I live in
 
01:58:12.770 --> 01:58:12.780 align:start position:0%
Auburn New Hampshire and I work in New
 
01:58:15.770 --> 01:58:15.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as well I just want to provide
 
01:58:18.470 --> 01:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
my thoughts on this and hopefully answer
 
01:58:21.229 --> 01:58:21.239 align:start position:0%
some of your own questions uh as best I
 
01:58:24.229 --> 01:58:24.239 align:start position:0%
can so uh first of all I just I just
 
01:58:25.129 --> 01:58:25.139 align:start position:0%
want to be
 
01:58:27.290 --> 01:58:27.300 align:start position:0%
you know I do resuscitations for babies
 
01:58:29.810 --> 01:58:29.820 align:start position:0%
that's my job I do it every day I've
 
01:58:32.810 --> 01:58:32.820 align:start position:0%
done it for many years I
 
01:58:35.030 --> 01:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
I'm passionate about that and I hope I
 
01:58:39.470 --> 01:58:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:41.270 --> 01:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
I just want to want to talk about like
 
01:58:43.370 --> 01:58:43.380 align:start position:0%
what goes into a resuscitation first of
 
01:58:46.609 --> 01:58:46.619 align:start position:0%
all you know at standard of care for uh
 
01:58:48.830 --> 01:58:48.840 align:start position:0%
for providers to follow a neonatal
 
01:58:50.570 --> 01:58:50.580 align:start position:0%
resuscitation program guidelines which
 
01:58:52.669 --> 01:58:52.679 align:start position:0%
is proved by American Pediatrics which
 
01:58:55.250 --> 01:58:55.260 align:start position:0%
uh basically goes through a whole set of
 
01:58:57.250 --> 01:58:57.260 align:start position:0%
evidence-based interventions you do
 
01:59:00.229 --> 01:59:00.239 align:start position:0%
based on how the the baby is in front of
 
01:59:03.470 --> 01:59:03.480 align:start position:0%
you so you know it requires uh possibly
 
01:59:05.350 --> 01:59:05.360 align:start position:0%
giving positive pressure ventilation
 
01:59:08.629 --> 01:59:08.639 align:start position:0%
intubating the baby giving chest
 
01:59:12.070 --> 01:59:12.080 align:start position:0%
compressions if they need it placing
 
01:59:15.830 --> 01:59:15.840 align:start position:0%
emergent IVs umbilical lines giving
 
01:59:17.930 --> 01:59:17.940 align:start position:0%
emergent medications like epinephrine
 
01:59:21.290 --> 01:59:21.300 align:start position:0%
which is like adrenaline uh and then
 
01:59:22.430 --> 01:59:22.440 align:start position:0%
ultimately you know if they need
 
01:59:25.250 --> 01:59:25.260 align:start position:0%
transport to a higher level of care
 
01:59:28.189 --> 01:59:28.199 align:start position:0%
providing that so you know all of those
 
01:59:30.589 --> 01:59:30.599 align:start position:0%
interventions as everybody is like so
 
01:59:32.930 --> 01:59:32.940 align:start position:0%
well described I think on both sides
 
01:59:35.870 --> 01:59:35.880 align:start position:0%
like there are there's they're not
 
01:59:38.930 --> 01:59:38.940 align:start position:0%
benign you know uh they they're risks
 
01:59:41.149 --> 01:59:41.159 align:start position:0%
associated with those giving positive
 
01:59:41.159 --> 01:59:42.050 align:start position:0%
associated with those giving positive
pressure

01:59:42.050 --> 01:59:42.060 align:start position:0%
pressure
 
01:59:43.729 --> 01:59:43.739 align:start position:0%
um giving innovate you know innovating a
 
01:59:46.510 --> 01:59:46.520 align:start position:0%
baby uh
 
01:59:49.609 --> 01:59:49.619 align:start position:0%
thorax I mean I've seen esophagus
 
01:59:52.250 --> 01:59:52.260 align:start position:0%
esophagus I guess those get punctured by
 
01:59:54.530 --> 01:59:54.540 align:start position:0%
ET tubes chest compressions just like
 
01:59:56.589 --> 01:59:56.599 align:start position:0%
with adults they can break babies ribs
 
01:59:59.330 --> 01:59:59.340 align:start position:0%
uh and then in terms of like depending
 
02:00:01.609 --> 02:00:01.619 align:start position:0%
on the gestational age of the baby you
 
02:00:04.310 --> 02:00:04.320 align:start position:0%
know their the skin is so so tender uh
 
02:00:06.530 --> 02:00:06.540 align:start position:0%
and fragile it tears really easily so
 
02:00:08.030 --> 02:00:08.040 align:start position:0%
just all the tape that goes into that
 
02:00:11.089 --> 02:00:11.099 align:start position:0%
and securing the tube securing IV sites
 
02:00:14.330 --> 02:00:14.340 align:start position:0%
uh can be can be traumatic too so all
 
02:00:15.950 --> 02:00:15.960 align:start position:0%
you know all of that is absolutely
 
02:00:15.960 --> 02:00:17.450 align:start position:0%
you know all of that is absolutely
necessary

02:00:17.450 --> 02:00:17.460 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
02:00:20.870 --> 02:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
um when you resuscitate a baby uh who
 
02:00:25.850 --> 02:00:25.860 align:start position:0%
like obviously has a future and uh and
 
02:00:25.860 --> 02:00:26.570 align:start position:0%
like obviously has a future and uh and
um

02:00:26.570 --> 02:00:26.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:29.030 --> 02:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
you know and and uh and a good good
 
02:00:32.270 --> 02:00:32.280 align:start position:0%
chance of survival uh of a low risk of
 
02:00:34.129 --> 02:00:34.139 align:start position:0%
mortality and morbidity
 
02:00:35.390 --> 02:00:35.400 align:start position:0%
um and I think like everybody has said
 
02:00:36.589 --> 02:00:36.599 align:start position:0%
like of course we don't want to do that
 
02:00:39.770 --> 02:00:39.780 align:start position:0%
for babies that uh or you know have a
 
02:00:42.890 --> 02:00:42.900 align:start position:0%
have an anomaly or a defect that's
 
02:00:46.430 --> 02:00:46.440 align:start position:0%
uh not consistent with life so I just
 
02:00:47.390 --> 02:00:47.400 align:start position:0%
want to put that out there I think
 
02:00:48.709 --> 02:00:48.719 align:start position:0%
everybody's like similar on the same
 
02:00:50.390 --> 02:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
page of that I do have like a few
 
02:00:52.370 --> 02:00:52.380 align:start position:0%
concerns just based on the on the way
 
02:00:55.250 --> 02:00:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:57.470 --> 02:00:57.480 align:start position:0%
and I just wanted to make a couple other
 
02:01:00.050 --> 02:01:00.060 align:start position:0%
comments too you know as a neonatologist
 
02:01:03.290 --> 02:01:03.300 align:start position:0%
like I I honestly just reading this I am
 
02:01:04.490 --> 02:01:04.500 align:start position:0%
most concerned about the part about
 
02:01:06.530 --> 02:01:06.540 align:start position:0%
withholding treatment with the intention
 
02:01:08.890 --> 02:01:08.900 align:start position:0%
of causing or Hasting an infant's death
 
02:01:12.169 --> 02:01:12.179 align:start position:0%
uh you know again I'm a neonatal ICU
 
02:01:12.179 --> 02:01:13.070 align:start position:0%
uh you know again I'm a neonatal ICU
doctor

02:01:13.070 --> 02:01:13.080 align:start position:0%
doctor
 
02:01:15.950 --> 02:01:15.960 align:start position:0%
um we can do a lot to keep babies alive
 
02:01:18.050 --> 02:01:18.060 align:start position:0%
um you know the the the example that
 
02:01:20.209 --> 02:01:20.219 align:start position:0%
people brought up was you know the baby
 
02:01:22.129 --> 02:01:22.139 align:start position:0%
without a brain the anus and
 
02:01:24.109 --> 02:01:24.119 align:start position:0%
anencephalic baby
 
02:01:25.910 --> 02:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
um you can keep that baby alive and keep
 
02:01:27.770 --> 02:01:27.780 align:start position:0%
that baby alive for for a month I mean
 
02:01:30.770 --> 02:01:30.780 align:start position:0%
keep keep baby alive longer for that uh
 
02:01:32.570 --> 02:01:32.580 align:start position:0%
if they're on a ventilator
 
02:01:32.580 --> 02:01:33.229 align:start position:0%
if they're on a ventilator
um

02:01:33.229 --> 02:01:33.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:34.870 --> 02:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
you know if they say in the hospital
 
02:01:37.669 --> 02:01:37.679 align:start position:0%
potentially uh if they have all their
 
02:01:39.290 --> 02:01:39.300 align:start position:0%
food all their feeds given through a
 
02:01:41.570 --> 02:01:41.580 align:start position:0%
G-tube or a feeding tube
 
02:01:45.169 --> 02:01:45.179 align:start position:0%
so uh you know if you withdraw care uh
 
02:01:46.790 --> 02:01:46.800 align:start position:0%
you know I would also argue that the
 
02:01:49.070 --> 02:01:49.080 align:start position:0%
intention is to to shorten that baby's
 
02:01:51.530 --> 02:01:51.540 align:start position:0%
life and I mean we can argue it uh
 
02:01:53.689 --> 02:01:53.699 align:start position:0%
lawyers can certainly argue it
 
02:01:54.830 --> 02:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
um we can argue within the medical
 
02:01:56.810 --> 02:01:56.820 align:start position:0%
profession between providers and Health
 
02:02:00.290 --> 02:02:00.300 align:start position:0%
Care Systems uh but I just I would ask
 
02:02:00.300 --> 02:02:01.490 align:start position:0%
Care Systems uh but I just I would ask
you

02:02:01.490 --> 02:02:01.500 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:02:04.669 --> 02:02:04.679 align:start position:0%
just to put yourself in our shoes
 
02:02:06.589 --> 02:02:06.599 align:start position:0%
if we're going to risk a lawsuit against
 
02:02:06.599 --> 02:02:07.910 align:start position:0%
if we're going to risk a lawsuit against
ourselves

02:02:07.910 --> 02:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
ourselves
 
02:02:07.920 --> 02:02:09.589 align:start position:0%
ourselves
and

02:02:09.589 --> 02:02:09.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:02:11.450 --> 02:02:11.460 align:start position:0%
to a point where you know when I apply
 
02:02:14.030 --> 02:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
for credentials at a hospital through a
 
02:02:15.470 --> 02:02:15.480 align:start position:0%
State Medical Board I have to put down
 
02:02:17.450 --> 02:02:17.460 align:start position:0%
every time I've been sued
 
02:02:19.729 --> 02:02:19.739 align:start position:0%
um the details of that suit if it was
 
02:02:21.169 --> 02:02:21.179 align:start position:0%
successful or not
 
02:02:24.169 --> 02:02:24.179 align:start position:0%
and that impacts like my ability to be
 
02:02:28.250 --> 02:02:28.260 align:start position:0%
employed so you know what myself would
 
02:02:31.250 --> 02:02:31.260 align:start position:0%
my Hospital would they ever risk that
 
02:02:31.260 --> 02:02:32.209 align:start position:0%
my Hospital would they ever risk that
um

02:02:32.209 --> 02:02:32.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:33.709 --> 02:02:33.719 align:start position:0%
you know how do you how do you define
 
02:02:35.930 --> 02:02:35.940 align:start position:0%
intention I mean that was a great point
 
02:02:38.330 --> 02:02:38.340 align:start position:0%
that was previously brought up I mean I
 
02:02:39.589 --> 02:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
know how I Define it I know how you
 
02:02:41.330 --> 02:02:41.340 align:start position:0%
probably you may Define it other people
 
02:02:43.310 --> 02:02:43.320 align:start position:0%
may Define it how's the law you're going
 
02:02:44.510 --> 02:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
to Define it how are they going to argue
 
02:02:46.250 --> 02:02:46.260 align:start position:0%
in front of Court am I going to win that
 
02:02:48.589 --> 02:02:48.599 align:start position:0%
argument am I going to roll the dice on
 
02:02:48.599 --> 02:02:49.669 align:start position:0%
argument am I going to roll the dice on
that

02:02:49.669 --> 02:02:49.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:02:49.679 --> 02:02:50.330 align:start position:0%
that
um

02:02:50.330 --> 02:02:50.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:52.370 --> 02:02:52.380 align:start position:0%
you know I I have kids I have a family
 
02:02:54.290 --> 02:02:54.300 align:start position:0%
like I said I live in Auburn New
 
02:02:56.149 --> 02:02:56.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I mean this I mean that
 
02:02:59.510 --> 02:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
affects that so uh
 
02:03:02.050 --> 02:03:02.060 align:start position:0%
yeah you know again
 
02:03:04.910 --> 02:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
we appreciate your test you're kind of
 
02:03:07.450 --> 02:03:07.460 align:start position:0%
gone over the three yeah
 
02:03:10.010 --> 02:03:10.020 align:start position:0%
I don't want to cut you off it's not bad
 
02:03:11.810 --> 02:03:11.820 align:start position:0%
I just asked you to sum up if you would
 
02:03:14.030 --> 02:03:14.040 align:start position:0%
please that's all thank you any
 
02:03:14.040 --> 02:03:15.050 align:start position:0%
please that's all thank you any
questions

02:03:15.050 --> 02:03:15.060 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:03:16.850 --> 02:03:16.860 align:start position:0%
questions for the switch yes
 
02:03:19.010 --> 02:03:19.020 align:start position:0%
representative Perez
 
02:03:23.570 --> 02:03:23.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:25.310 --> 02:03:25.320 align:start position:0%
is surviving
 
02:03:27.410 --> 02:03:27.420 align:start position:0%
in neonatal
 
02:03:31.850 --> 02:03:31.860 align:start position:0%
and the parent says to you I don't want
 
02:03:35.930 --> 02:03:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:38.330 --> 02:03:38.340 align:start position:0%
does that not put you in the same
 
02:03:40.910 --> 02:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
predicament of
 
02:03:42.830 --> 02:03:42.840 align:start position:0%
withdrawing care
 
02:03:46.030 --> 02:03:46.040 align:start position:0%
is an intentional way of
 
02:03:50.089 --> 02:03:50.099 align:start position:0%
hastening the death of a child I mean I
 
02:03:52.129 --> 02:03:52.139 align:start position:0%
worked intensive care not neonatal care
 
02:03:55.070 --> 02:03:55.080 align:start position:0%
but I know if the family
 
02:03:58.490 --> 02:03:58.500 align:start position:0%
wanted someone taken off a respirator
 
02:04:02.149 --> 02:04:02.159 align:start position:0%
because they could no longer survive the
 
02:04:04.370 --> 02:04:04.380 align:start position:0%
family's wishes
 
02:04:04.380 --> 02:04:05.570 align:start position:0%
family's wishes
were

02:04:05.570 --> 02:04:05.580 align:start position:0%
were
 
02:04:07.070 --> 02:04:07.080 align:start position:0%
listened to
 
02:04:09.790 --> 02:04:09.800 align:start position:0%
not being in neonatal
 
02:04:12.229 --> 02:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
where where are you is that not
 
02:04:15.050 --> 02:04:15.060 align:start position:0%
hastening a death as well
 
02:04:18.410 --> 02:04:18.420 align:start position:0%
I I agree with you I think like it would
 
02:04:20.629 --> 02:04:20.639 align:start position:0%
hasten the infant's death by taking I'm
 
02:04:22.970 --> 02:04:22.980 align:start position:0%
sorry it would hasten the offense death
 
02:04:26.149 --> 02:04:26.159 align:start position:0%
by taking them off off a respirator off
 
02:04:27.669 --> 02:04:27.679 align:start position:0%
a ventilator
 
02:04:30.470 --> 02:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
but you don't do it
 
02:04:33.109 --> 02:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
if you think the child has a possibility
 
02:04:35.030 --> 02:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
of surviving or correct
 
02:04:38.330 --> 02:04:38.340 align:start position:0%
uh I think that's hard too because uh it
 
02:04:40.430 --> 02:04:40.440 align:start position:0%
really depends on what the baby's
 
02:04:42.830 --> 02:04:42.840 align:start position:0%
gestational age is and I know premature
 
02:04:44.689 --> 02:04:44.699 align:start position:0%
gets brought up a lot here
 
02:04:44.699 --> 02:04:45.470 align:start position:0%
gets brought up a lot here
um

02:04:45.470 --> 02:04:45.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:47.450 --> 02:04:47.460 align:start position:0%
but it depends on you know what the
 
02:04:49.370 --> 02:04:49.380 align:start position:0%
babies you know when we look at a baby
 
02:04:52.250 --> 02:04:52.260 align:start position:0%
that is premature for example and say at
 
02:04:54.530 --> 02:04:54.540 align:start position:0%
the edge of viability a lot of things go
 
02:04:56.149 --> 02:04:56.159 align:start position:0%
into that like we're trying to like just
 
02:04:59.149 --> 02:04:59.159 align:start position:0%
kneel down a gestational age uh it also
 
02:05:00.950 --> 02:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
has to go in with like what their
 
02:05:04.010 --> 02:05:04.020 align:start position:0%
estimated birth weight is uh what their
 
02:05:05.149 --> 02:05:05.159 align:start position:0%
blood flow is like in their biblical
 
02:05:07.850 --> 02:05:07.860 align:start position:0%
artery in their brain how well they're
 
02:05:09.709 --> 02:05:09.719 align:start position:0%
growing over the past several weeks all
 
02:05:12.410 --> 02:05:12.420 align:start position:0%
those things go into that so if if you
 
02:05:14.330 --> 02:05:14.340 align:start position:0%
have a baby that comes out that has a
 
02:05:15.649 --> 02:05:15.659 align:start position:0%
you know let's just go on National
 
02:05:18.649 --> 02:05:18.659 align:start position:0%
guidelines like a 22 week or 10 chance
 
02:05:20.270 --> 02:05:20.280 align:start position:0%
of living
 
02:05:22.609 --> 02:05:22.619 align:start position:0%
um at in most places it depends on where
 
02:05:23.589 --> 02:05:23.599 align:start position:0%
you deliver
 
02:05:26.149 --> 02:05:26.159 align:start position:0%
and you say okay you know to the parents
 
02:05:29.510 --> 02:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:31.609 --> 02:05:31.619 align:start position:0%
your chance of cerebral palsy is 75
 
02:05:31.619 --> 02:05:32.629 align:start position:0%
your chance of cerebral palsy is 75
percent

02:05:32.629 --> 02:05:32.639 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:05:33.890 --> 02:05:33.900 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:05:36.169 --> 02:05:36.179 align:start position:0%
you are still giving that that family
 
02:05:39.410 --> 02:05:39.420 align:start position:0%
the decision to how how much of a
 
02:05:41.270 --> 02:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
resuscitation they want that's that's
 
02:05:42.890 --> 02:05:42.900 align:start position:0%
standard of care no matter where you go
 
02:05:42.900 --> 02:05:44.750 align:start position:0%
standard of care no matter where you go
so

02:05:44.750 --> 02:05:44.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:05:44.760 --> 02:05:45.709 align:start position:0%
so
um

02:05:45.709 --> 02:05:45.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:47.930 --> 02:05:47.940 align:start position:0%
I guess that would be my argument with
 
02:05:50.629 --> 02:05:50.639 align:start position:0%
you I would say that we're not with you
 
02:05:53.750 --> 02:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
but the argument would be uh even babies
 
02:05:55.910 --> 02:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
born with a heart heart rate that may
 
02:05:58.669 --> 02:05:58.679 align:start position:0%
have a very small chance of living uh
 
02:06:01.609 --> 02:06:01.619 align:start position:0%
there is absolutely debate and uh
 
02:06:04.070 --> 02:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
perennial preference involved in that
 
02:06:06.649 --> 02:06:06.659 align:start position:0%
other questions for this week
 
02:06:09.229 --> 02:06:09.239 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for that
 
02:06:11.390 --> 02:06:11.400 align:start position:0%
I think one of the things that we're
 
02:06:14.270 --> 02:06:14.280 align:start position:0%
missing in this bill and I keep bringing
 
02:06:18.589 --> 02:06:18.599 align:start position:0%
it up is trying to protect the
 
02:06:22.189 --> 02:06:22.199 align:start position:0%
um child that is born as a
 
02:06:22.199 --> 02:06:23.870 align:start position:0%
um child that is born as a
missed

02:06:23.870 --> 02:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
missed
 
02:06:26.450 --> 02:06:26.460 align:start position:0%
abortion and
 
02:06:26.460 --> 02:06:27.169 align:start position:0%
abortion and
um

02:06:27.169 --> 02:06:27.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:31.010 --> 02:06:31.020 align:start position:0%
and I know that that is very very rare
 
02:06:33.410 --> 02:06:33.420 align:start position:0%
but it's my understanding and I would
 
02:06:35.689 --> 02:06:35.699 align:start position:0%
think you'd agree that if you had a
 
02:06:41.209 --> 02:06:41.219 align:start position:0%
child arrive who ended up in the NICU at
 
02:06:44.510 --> 02:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
23 23 and a half weeks and only ended up
 
02:06:46.550 --> 02:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
in the NICU because of perhaps some
 
02:06:50.270 --> 02:06:50.280 align:start position:0%
complication of the um
 
02:06:53.089 --> 02:06:53.099 align:start position:0%
missed abortion
 
02:06:56.149 --> 02:06:56.159 align:start position:0%
it would not be up to it would be up to
 
02:06:58.669 --> 02:06:58.679 align:start position:0%
the doctors to determine the survival of
 
02:07:00.169 --> 02:07:00.179 align:start position:0%
that child
 
02:07:03.050 --> 02:07:03.060 align:start position:0%
yeah I think for myself it it wouldn't
 
02:07:06.129 --> 02:07:06.139 align:start position:0%
matter the abortion aspect of it like
 
02:07:09.709 --> 02:07:09.719 align:start position:0%
once the baby's born the baby's like
 
02:07:12.229 --> 02:07:12.239 align:start position:0%
basically is is treated the same as any
 
02:07:15.649 --> 02:07:15.659 align:start position:0%
other baby uh I would say I would just
 
02:07:20.089 --> 02:07:20.099 align:start position:0%
caution on the reason 23 week 22-week
 
02:07:22.250 --> 02:07:22.260 align:start position:0%
babies go to the NICU those babies are
 
02:07:23.629 --> 02:07:23.639 align:start position:0%
gonna be in the NICU for three three
 
02:07:25.490 --> 02:07:25.500 align:start position:0%
months and they're going to be on a
 
02:07:27.169 --> 02:07:27.179 align:start position:0%
ventilator for a period of time they're
 
02:07:29.450 --> 02:07:29.460 align:start position:0%
going to need blood pressure medications
 
02:07:31.070 --> 02:07:31.080 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of interventions that
 
02:07:33.050 --> 02:07:33.060 align:start position:0%
go into that for example their lungs
 
02:07:35.990 --> 02:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
don't even have the alveoli the air sacs
 
02:07:37.310 --> 02:07:37.320 align:start position:0%
at the end developed at that point so
 
02:07:39.290 --> 02:07:39.300 align:start position:0%
you're trying to ventilate through hard
 
02:07:41.330 --> 02:07:41.340 align:start position:0%
tubes bronchioles because they don't
 
02:07:43.370 --> 02:07:43.380 align:start position:0%
even have the air sacs developed that
 
02:07:45.709 --> 02:07:45.719 align:start position:0%
takes a lot of uh you know a lot of
 
02:07:47.149 --> 02:07:47.159 align:start position:0%
pressure and a lot of invasive
 
02:07:49.790 --> 02:07:49.800 align:start position:0%
respiratory management so I just I just
 
02:07:52.850 --> 02:07:52.860 align:start position:0%
caution like you know 22 23 week baby is
 
02:07:56.930 --> 02:07:56.940 align:start position:0%
not uh there's not really a healthy one
 
02:07:58.729 --> 02:07:58.739 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions to this
 
02:07:58.739 --> 02:08:00.050 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions to this
Witness

02:08:00.050 --> 02:08:00.060 align:start position:0%
Witness
 
02:08:02.089 --> 02:08:02.099 align:start position:0%
representative Stapleton
 
02:08:04.250 --> 02:08:04.260 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
02:08:07.310 --> 02:08:07.320 align:start position:0%
the discussion brings one question to
 
02:08:11.030 --> 02:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
mine would a an amendment be useful
 
02:08:15.229 --> 02:08:15.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:17.870 --> 02:08:17.880 align:start position:0%
exception for
 
02:08:21.350 --> 02:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
not being obligated to to extraordinary
 
02:08:24.770 --> 02:08:24.780 align:start position:0%
means to preserve the lice
 
02:08:28.910 --> 02:08:28.920 align:start position:0%
of a child that has a terminal
 
02:08:28.920 --> 02:08:29.530 align:start position:0%
of a child that has a terminal
um

02:08:29.530 --> 02:08:29.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:36.589 --> 02:08:36.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:39.050 --> 02:08:39.060 align:start position:0%
I mean I I see what you're saying like I
 
02:08:41.149 --> 02:08:41.159 align:start position:0%
personally just my own perspective I
 
02:08:42.709 --> 02:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
don't I don't think it's necessary
 
02:08:44.750 --> 02:08:44.760 align:start position:0%
because that is what we what we do right
 
02:08:44.760 --> 02:08:46.790 align:start position:0%
because that is what we what we do right
now

02:08:46.790 --> 02:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:08:48.770 --> 02:08:48.780 align:start position:0%
this isn't like something I've been like
 
02:08:50.930 --> 02:08:50.940 align:start position:0%
you know waiting for and hoping for will
 
02:08:52.669 --> 02:08:52.679 align:start position:0%
somebody make this change so that we can
 
02:08:55.250 --> 02:08:55.260 align:start position:0%
like do our jobs better like for me it's
 
02:08:57.950 --> 02:08:57.960 align:start position:0%
I'm doing the same job you know or I'm
 
02:08:59.510 --> 02:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
not doing the same job but if the bill
 
02:09:01.850 --> 02:09:01.860 align:start position:0%
bill comes into gets passed they will be
 
02:09:04.189 --> 02:09:04.199 align:start position:0%
doing it differently but right now I
 
02:09:06.770 --> 02:09:06.780 align:start position:0%
think in the medical profession you know
 
02:09:08.149 --> 02:09:08.159 align:start position:0%
everybody's like
 
02:09:10.729 --> 02:09:10.739 align:start position:0%
not happy but uh
 
02:09:13.010 --> 02:09:13.020 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a system for for
 
02:09:14.689 --> 02:09:14.699 align:start position:0%
working within that that's good for
 
02:09:17.870 --> 02:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
providers and families thank you
 
02:09:17.880 --> 02:09:19.609 align:start position:0%
providers and families thank you
yes

02:09:19.609 --> 02:09:19.619 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:09:22.870 --> 02:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
I asked that in the context of some
 
02:09:25.790 --> 02:09:25.800 align:start position:0%
moral beliefs that
 
02:09:28.850 --> 02:09:28.860 align:start position:0%
were not obligated to
 
02:09:32.030 --> 02:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
use extraordinary means
 
02:09:35.390 --> 02:09:35.400 align:start position:0%
to protect the life that's going to be
 
02:09:38.270 --> 02:09:38.280 align:start position:0%
terminal or is terminal
 
02:09:40.970 --> 02:09:40.980 align:start position:0%
and that is not opposed to what doctors
 
02:09:43.790 --> 02:09:43.800 align:start position:0%
do you try to do the best you can
 
02:09:45.950 --> 02:09:45.960 align:start position:0%
but there are some circumstances that
 
02:09:47.629 --> 02:09:47.639 align:start position:0%
you cannot overcome
 
02:09:49.669 --> 02:09:49.679 align:start position:0%
and there's going to be a termination of
 
02:09:49.679 --> 02:09:50.750 align:start position:0%
and there's going to be a termination of
life

02:09:50.750 --> 02:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
life
 
02:09:55.129 --> 02:09:55.139 align:start position:0%
so the moral code would say that we let
 
02:09:57.850 --> 02:09:57.860 align:start position:0%
the natural death occur
 
02:10:01.430 --> 02:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
and the choices not to use extraordinary
 
02:10:04.850 --> 02:10:04.860 align:start position:0%
means beyond the capability of keeping
 
02:10:08.930 --> 02:10:08.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:11.270 --> 02:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
other I'm sorry go ahead do you have
 
02:10:12.649 --> 02:10:12.659 align:start position:0%
something so we want to say doctor
 
02:10:12.659 --> 02:10:16.430 align:start position:0%
something so we want to say doctor
please

02:10:16.430 --> 02:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:18.770 --> 02:10:18.780 align:start position:0%
yeah I I definitely hear what you're
 
02:10:18.780 --> 02:10:19.790 align:start position:0%
yeah I I definitely hear what you're
saying

02:10:19.790 --> 02:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
saying
 
02:10:22.129 --> 02:10:22.139 align:start position:0%
um and I I think like make cerebral
 
02:10:24.770 --> 02:10:24.780 align:start position:0%
cerebrally I like understand that and
 
02:10:27.350 --> 02:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
agree with that it's uh it's just how
 
02:10:28.550 --> 02:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
things get written out and then
 
02:10:32.410 --> 02:10:32.420 align:start position:0%
translated and then acted on that um
 
02:10:34.729 --> 02:10:34.739 align:start position:0%
there's just a lot a lot of gray area
 
02:10:37.310 --> 02:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
for that for those professionals other
 
02:10:40.850 --> 02:10:40.860 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:43.850 --> 02:10:43.860 align:start position:0%
representative page sorry thank you Mr
 
02:10:45.709 --> 02:10:45.719 align:start position:0%
chair thanks for taking my question
 
02:10:47.990 --> 02:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
I just want to clarify that I heard you
 
02:10:52.129 --> 02:10:52.139 align:start position:0%
correctly and if I didn't correct me
 
02:10:54.589 --> 02:10:54.599 align:start position:0%
um my understanding is what you
 
02:10:57.169 --> 02:10:57.179 align:start position:0%
indicated is that currently
 
02:10:59.270 --> 02:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
you practice the medical standard of
 
02:10:59.280 --> 02:11:00.709 align:start position:0%
you practice the medical standard of
care

02:11:00.709 --> 02:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
care
 
02:11:04.430 --> 02:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
that if this bill were to become a law
 
02:11:08.209 --> 02:11:08.219 align:start position:0%
that might interfere or at least cause
 
02:11:10.070 --> 02:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
in your mind
 
02:11:12.350 --> 02:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
some additional questioning
 
02:11:14.810 --> 02:11:14.820 align:start position:0%
about what the law says or what you
 
02:11:16.550 --> 02:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
think the law might say or what a lawyer
 
02:11:18.649 --> 02:11:18.659 align:start position:0%
might say versus what
 
02:11:20.570 --> 02:11:20.580 align:start position:0%
you as the medical professional might
 
02:11:22.729 --> 02:11:22.739 align:start position:0%
deliver to that care and therefore
 
02:11:25.310 --> 02:11:25.320 align:start position:0%
perhaps undermine
 
02:11:26.750 --> 02:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
the good work that you're doing right
 
02:11:30.050 --> 02:11:30.060 align:start position:0%
now is that fair that's correct
 
02:11:33.169 --> 02:11:33.179 align:start position:0%
other questions to this Witness
 
02:11:36.370 --> 02:11:36.380 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much next is
 
02:11:39.470 --> 02:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
Maris Holland and the witness after that
 
02:11:46.189 --> 02:11:46.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:48.169 --> 02:11:48.179 align:start position:0%
hello committee members my name is Mayor
 
02:11:50.089 --> 02:11:50.099 align:start position:0%
stolen I'm a resident physician in OB
 
02:11:53.209 --> 02:11:53.219 align:start position:0%

um
 
02:11:57.950 --> 02:11:57.960 align:start position:0%
when representative cordelli introduced
 
02:11:59.689 --> 02:11:59.699 align:start position:0%
this bill he said this is a simple
 
02:12:02.750 --> 02:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
concept I think everyone's testimony
 
02:12:04.729 --> 02:12:04.739 align:start position:0%
today can attest to the fact that this
 
02:12:06.830 --> 02:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
is not simple this is exceedingly
 
02:12:10.669 --> 02:12:10.679 align:start position:0%
complex and there are many iterations of
 
02:12:12.530 --> 02:12:12.540 align:start position:0%
different situations hypothetical
 
02:12:15.890 --> 02:12:15.900 align:start position:0%
situations complex medical diagnoses
 
02:12:18.770 --> 02:12:18.780 align:start position:0%
rare medical diagnoses and situations
 
02:12:20.450 --> 02:12:20.460 align:start position:0%
that perhaps no one in this room has
 
02:12:22.910 --> 02:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
even thought about that could apply and
 
02:12:25.729 --> 02:12:25.739 align:start position:0%
be affected by the language in this bill
 
02:12:28.129 --> 02:12:28.139 align:start position:0%
the way the bill is written doesn't have
 
02:12:30.229 --> 02:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
to do with how Medical Care actually
 
02:12:33.370 --> 02:12:33.380 align:start position:0%
works it's based on myths or
 
02:12:35.810 --> 02:12:35.820 align:start position:0%
misunderstandings of what happens in the
 
02:12:37.490 --> 02:12:37.500 align:start position:0%
medical field
 
02:12:39.890 --> 02:12:39.900 align:start position:0%
I don't think this bill is necessary I
 
02:12:41.570 --> 02:12:41.580 align:start position:0%
think that doctors already have the
 
02:12:43.669 --> 02:12:43.679 align:start position:0%
obligation to provide appropriate
 
02:12:45.109 --> 02:12:45.119 align:start position:0%
Medical Care
 
02:12:45.119 --> 02:12:46.430 align:start position:0%
Medical Care
it

02:12:46.430 --> 02:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:12:46.440 --> 02:12:46.970 align:start position:0%
it
um

02:12:46.970 --> 02:12:46.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:49.850 --> 02:12:49.860 align:start position:0%
it makes my heartbreak to hear someone
 
02:12:52.069 --> 02:12:52.079 align:start position:0%
bring up someone like hermit Gosnell who
 
02:12:56.810 --> 02:12:56.820 align:start position:0%
is a indicted murderer and compare the
 
02:12:59.689 --> 02:12:59.699 align:start position:0%
medical providers in this room to that
 
02:12:59.699 --> 02:13:00.709 align:start position:0%
medical providers in this room to that
person

02:13:00.709 --> 02:13:00.719 align:start position:0%
person
 
02:13:03.950 --> 02:13:03.960 align:start position:0%
I would never bring up someone who had
 
02:13:06.290 --> 02:13:06.300 align:start position:0%
murdered a physician who was an
 
02:13:08.569 --> 02:13:08.579 align:start position:0%
anti-abortion extremist and compare that
 
02:13:10.189 --> 02:13:10.199 align:start position:0%
to the other people who are speaking in
 
02:13:12.229 --> 02:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
this room
 
02:13:14.089 --> 02:13:14.099 align:start position:0%
representative Simon is right that I
 
02:13:14.990 --> 02:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
can't speak to every Medical
 
02:13:16.970 --> 02:13:16.980 align:start position:0%
Professional and I can't speak to things
 
02:13:19.250 --> 02:13:19.260 align:start position:0%
that have happened in the past or myths
 
02:13:21.410 --> 02:13:21.420 align:start position:0%
or or even real stories that people have
 
02:13:23.629 --> 02:13:23.639 align:start position:0%
come forward for abortion
 
02:13:23.639 --> 02:13:24.470 align:start position:0%
come forward for abortion
um

02:13:24.470 --> 02:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:27.830 --> 02:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh anti-abortion um speakers but I can
 
02:13:30.350 --> 02:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
tell you what I see currently as a
 
02:13:30.360 --> 02:13:31.310 align:start position:0%
tell you what I see currently as a
position

02:13:31.310 --> 02:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
position
 
02:13:33.709 --> 02:13:33.719 align:start position:0%
practicing in New Hampshire these
 
02:13:35.629 --> 02:13:35.639 align:start position:0%
hypothetical situations that you speak
 
02:13:37.910 --> 02:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
of I have never seen
 
02:13:41.510 --> 02:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
I have seen many of the situations that
 
02:13:43.850 --> 02:13:43.860 align:start position:0%
are being testified against here stories
 
02:13:45.709 --> 02:13:45.719 align:start position:0%
like Sawyer
 
02:13:47.450 --> 02:13:47.460 align:start position:0%
um stories like this gentleman here
 
02:13:50.209 --> 02:13:50.219 align:start position:0%
who's um whose child had spina bifida I
 
02:13:51.649 --> 02:13:51.659 align:start position:0%
see those stories
 
02:13:54.790 --> 02:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
frequently and the language in this bill
 
02:13:57.290 --> 02:13:57.300 align:start position:0%
would undermine medical professionals
 
02:13:59.810 --> 02:13:59.820 align:start position:0%
ability to do their job safely we
 
02:14:01.550 --> 02:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
already live in a litigious Society
 
02:14:03.649 --> 02:14:03.659 align:start position:0%
where we worry about the legal
 
02:14:03.659 --> 02:14:05.330 align:start position:0%
where we worry about the legal
implications

02:14:05.330 --> 02:14:05.340 align:start position:0%
implications
 
02:14:07.729 --> 02:14:07.739 align:start position:0%
um for what we do as an OB GYN we have
 
02:14:09.589 --> 02:14:09.599 align:start position:0%
the highest malpractice suits in any any
 
02:14:09.599 --> 02:14:11.149 align:start position:0%
the highest malpractice suits in any any
profession

02:14:11.149 --> 02:14:11.159 align:start position:0%
profession
 
02:14:15.169 --> 02:14:15.179 align:start position:0%
the way that this is written is vague we
 
02:14:18.050 --> 02:14:18.060 align:start position:0%
have talked all day all morning about
 
02:14:21.410 --> 02:14:21.420 align:start position:0%
the intent of this bill I'm still not
 
02:14:23.629 --> 02:14:23.639 align:start position:0%
really sure what the intent is I've
 
02:14:26.209 --> 02:14:26.219 align:start position:0%
heard the the supporters of this bill
 
02:14:28.910 --> 02:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
try to clarify multiple times what the
 
02:14:30.530 --> 02:14:30.540 align:start position:0%
intent is because it sounds like the
 
02:14:32.450 --> 02:14:32.460 align:start position:0%
intent is not to
 
02:14:34.010 --> 02:14:34.020 align:start position:0%
um speak against
 
02:14:36.770 --> 02:14:36.780 align:start position:0%
um you know small premature infants who
 
02:14:39.109 --> 02:14:39.119 align:start position:0%
were born with fetal anomalies but how
 
02:14:41.149 --> 02:14:41.159 align:start position:0%
do I know how do I Define their intent
 
02:14:44.750 --> 02:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
and yet you're suggesting that
 
02:14:46.370 --> 02:14:46.380 align:start position:0%
Physicians be charged with a class a
 
02:14:49.010 --> 02:14:49.020 align:start position:0%
felony based on on Whose ability to
 
02:14:52.189 --> 02:14:52.199 align:start position:0%
determine what are its intent is who is
 
02:14:55.310 --> 02:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
better prepared to
 
02:14:58.550 --> 02:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
to classify a situation and the medical
 
02:15:00.890 --> 02:15:00.900 align:start position:0%
appropriateness of that situation than
 
02:15:02.810 --> 02:15:02.820 align:start position:0%
someone who went to medical school and
 
02:15:05.629 --> 02:15:05.639 align:start position:0%
someone who has trained postgraduate to
 
02:15:08.390 --> 02:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
treat these situations
 
02:15:10.850 --> 02:15:10.860 align:start position:0%
this bill has inflammatory language
 
02:15:13.669 --> 02:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
based in misinformation from a medical
 
02:15:16.010 --> 02:15:16.020 align:start position:0%
perspective the bill is unnecessary and
 
02:15:18.050 --> 02:15:18.060 align:start position:0%
ludicrous it's not how Medical Care
 
02:15:19.970 --> 02:15:19.980 align:start position:0%
works and most importantly it's
 
02:15:22.069 --> 02:15:22.079 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences and vagueness
 
02:15:24.169 --> 02:15:24.179 align:start position:0%
will cause suffering to families that
 
02:15:26.750 --> 02:15:26.760 align:start position:0%
have spoken today politicians should not
 
02:15:28.250 --> 02:15:28.260 align:start position:0%
be making laws that are dictating
 
02:15:29.990 --> 02:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
Medical Treatments
 
02:15:32.270 --> 02:15:32.280 align:start position:0%
we should be performing the usual
 
02:15:34.370 --> 02:15:34.380 align:start position:0%
standard medical medical standard of
 
02:15:36.830 --> 02:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
care I strongly encourage you to oppose
 
02:15:39.830 --> 02:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
this legislation questions for this week
 
02:15:43.010 --> 02:15:43.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:47.270 --> 02:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:50.149 --> 02:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
um and I I had to skip out to for
 
02:15:52.790 --> 02:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
another hearing for an hour but um
 
02:15:54.709 --> 02:15:54.719 align:start position:0%
something is not to find your bills and
 
02:15:57.470 --> 02:15:57.480 align:start position:0%
is an infant so is there any
 
02:15:59.450 --> 02:15:59.460 align:start position:0%
criteria to say who's an infinite who's
 
02:16:01.189 --> 02:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
not I mean certainly
 
02:16:03.109 --> 02:16:03.119 align:start position:0%
I was born alive I fit that definition
 
02:16:04.850 --> 02:16:04.860 align:start position:0%
everybody in the room does but I don't
 
02:16:06.770 --> 02:16:06.780 align:start position:0%
think they're trying to protect
 
02:16:08.990 --> 02:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
my right to life or so-called right to
 
02:16:11.870 --> 02:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
life with this bill if I
 
02:16:13.790 --> 02:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
if I had a terminal illness I think I've
 
02:16:16.010 --> 02:16:16.020 align:start position:0%
been living will which says they
 
02:16:18.530 --> 02:16:18.540 align:start position:0%
shouldn't take extraordinary means and
 
02:16:20.689 --> 02:16:20.699 align:start position:0%
um this is obviously requiring
 
02:16:24.649 --> 02:16:24.659 align:start position:0%
at least some people some you know very
 
02:16:26.390 --> 02:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
young people have been born alive to be
 
02:16:28.370 --> 02:16:28.380 align:start position:0%
subjected to extraordinary means even if
 
02:16:30.830 --> 02:16:30.840 align:start position:0%
their parents or their Guardians um
 
02:16:33.889 --> 02:16:33.899 align:start position:0%
Advocates have would prefer otherwise so
 
02:16:35.509 --> 02:16:35.519 align:start position:0%
like is there uh where is there a cutoff
 
02:16:39.049 --> 02:16:39.059 align:start position:0%
point or any clear cutoff point or like
 
02:16:41.030 --> 02:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
who's an infant and then he's just a
 
02:16:44.209 --> 02:16:44.219 align:start position:0%
very young baby
 
02:16:46.129 --> 02:16:46.139 align:start position:0%
I would defer to the pediatrician in the
 
02:16:49.370 --> 02:16:49.380 align:start position:0%
room but I think of an infant as a child
 
02:16:52.190 --> 02:16:52.200 align:start position:0%
under the age of six months
 
02:16:57.589 --> 02:16:57.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:00.169 --> 02:17:00.179 align:start position:0%
I've heard many testify today that
 
02:17:02.389 --> 02:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
Physicians practice within the standard
 
02:17:05.330 --> 02:17:05.340 align:start position:0%
of care and it seems that
 
02:17:07.549 --> 02:17:07.559 align:start position:0%
the intent of this bill was to make
 
02:17:09.889 --> 02:17:09.899 align:start position:0%
those who are not practicing within the
 
02:17:12.650 --> 02:17:12.660 align:start position:0%
standard of care liable if this was
 
02:17:16.429 --> 02:17:16.439 align:start position:0%
amended to States somehow
 
02:17:19.370 --> 02:17:19.380 align:start position:0%
about acting within the standard of care
 
02:17:22.070 --> 02:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
that you wouldn't be liable for that
 
02:17:23.629 --> 02:17:23.639 align:start position:0%
um would that be something that you'd be
 
02:17:26.570 --> 02:17:26.580 align:start position:0%
amenable to those laws already exist we
 
02:17:27.889 --> 02:17:27.899 align:start position:0%
already practice within the standard of
 
02:17:29.030 --> 02:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
care because that's what the Board of
 
02:17:30.950 --> 02:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
Medicine suggests I don't think there's
 
02:17:32.629 --> 02:17:32.639 align:start position:0%
any Amendment or any change to the
 
02:17:35.330 --> 02:17:35.340 align:start position:0%
language in this bill that could make it
 
02:17:35.340 --> 02:17:38.330 align:start position:0%
language in this bill that could make it
work

02:17:38.330 --> 02:17:38.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:42.770 --> 02:17:42.780 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative Perez
 
02:17:44.990 --> 02:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that the previous
 
02:17:49.070 --> 02:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
physician that spoke said that he might
 
02:17:50.870 --> 02:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
not treat
 
02:17:55.549 --> 02:17:55.559 align:start position:0%
if there was a 10 or less chance of
 
02:17:59.089 --> 02:17:59.099 align:start position:0%
survival this shows me that
 
02:18:01.549 --> 02:18:01.559 align:start position:0%
everyone has a different
 
02:18:05.929 --> 02:18:05.939 align:start position:0%
I was in the intensive care for 42 years
 
02:18:08.709 --> 02:18:08.719 align:start position:0%
everybody has different
 
02:18:12.530 --> 02:18:12.540 align:start position:0%
interpretations of standard of care
 
02:18:17.030 --> 02:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
um so I think to say that we you know
 
02:18:19.910 --> 02:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
this is has too many hypotheticals I've
 
02:18:21.169 --> 02:18:21.179 align:start position:0%
seen them
 
02:18:23.929 --> 02:18:23.939 align:start position:0%
I would like to believe like in every
 
02:18:23.939 --> 02:18:25.190 align:start position:0%
I would like to believe like in every
profession

02:18:25.190 --> 02:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
profession
 
02:18:25.200 --> 02:18:26.570 align:start position:0%
profession
everybody

02:18:26.570 --> 02:18:26.580 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
02:18:29.209 --> 02:18:29.219 align:start position:0%
is perfect and follows the guidelines
 
02:18:32.509 --> 02:18:32.519 align:start position:0%
okay unfortunately
 
02:18:34.669 --> 02:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
we have all seen that that does not
 
02:18:34.679 --> 02:18:36.049 align:start position:0%
we have all seen that that does not
exist

02:18:36.049 --> 02:18:36.059 align:start position:0%
exist
 
02:18:38.389 --> 02:18:38.399 align:start position:0%
what can we do
 
02:18:38.399 --> 02:18:40.190 align:start position:0%
what can we do
to

02:18:40.190 --> 02:18:40.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:18:44.150 --> 02:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
make sure people positions operate
 
02:18:47.450 --> 02:18:47.460 align:start position:0%
within the standard of prayer not sue
 
02:18:49.310 --> 02:18:49.320 align:start position:0%
them when they didn't
 
02:18:52.910 --> 02:18:52.920 align:start position:0%
but how can we stop them from not do you
 
02:18:55.009 --> 02:18:55.019 align:start position:0%
understand what I'm saying I do I think
 
02:18:56.570 --> 02:18:56.580 align:start position:0%
it's a valid question I don't think it
 
02:18:58.129 --> 02:18:58.139 align:start position:0%
has anything to do with this bill I
 
02:18:59.690 --> 02:18:59.700 align:start position:0%
don't think this pill should should
 
02:19:02.089 --> 02:19:02.099 align:start position:0%
affect that I think that that's a larger
 
02:19:04.250 --> 02:19:04.260 align:start position:0%
existential question about how we do
 
02:19:06.410 --> 02:19:06.420 align:start position:0%
licensing for different professions how
 
02:19:08.509 --> 02:19:08.519 align:start position:0%
do we keep anyone from doing the job
 
02:19:11.450 --> 02:19:11.460 align:start position:0%
that they're supposed to do
 
02:19:11.460 --> 02:19:13.610 align:start position:0%
that they're supposed to do
yes

02:19:13.610 --> 02:19:13.620 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:19:15.530 --> 02:19:15.540 align:start position:0%
but we're not talking we're talking
 
02:19:17.089 --> 02:19:17.099 align:start position:0%
about the life
 
02:19:18.889 --> 02:19:18.899 align:start position:0%
of a child
 
02:19:21.169 --> 02:19:21.179 align:start position:0%
so we're not talking about
 
02:19:23.810 --> 02:19:23.820 align:start position:0%
you know whatever happens whatever
 
02:19:26.870 --> 02:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the life of a child
 
02:19:29.929 --> 02:19:29.939 align:start position:0%
that has been born so it is not an
 
02:19:32.389 --> 02:19:32.399 align:start position:0%
unborn child never seen that happen that
 
02:19:36.849 --> 02:19:36.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:39.169 --> 02:19:39.179 align:start position:0%
not in The Accidental way that we're
 
02:19:41.870 --> 02:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
talking about here
 
02:19:44.810 --> 02:19:44.820 align:start position:0%
other questions for this week
 
02:19:47.509 --> 02:19:47.519 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
02:19:49.849 --> 02:19:49.859 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
02:19:52.130 --> 02:19:52.140 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to boil it down to a little
 
02:19:55.130 --> 02:19:55.140 align:start position:0%
more basic
 
02:19:57.830 --> 02:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
what's the purpose of law
 
02:20:00.110 --> 02:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
purpose of law is not to address the
 
02:20:02.630 --> 02:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
people are doing good
 
02:20:05.450 --> 02:20:05.460 align:start position:0%
but rather the few
 
02:20:08.330 --> 02:20:08.340 align:start position:0%
that are doing bad
 
02:20:11.810 --> 02:20:11.820 align:start position:0%
we have to come to the reality that
 
02:20:14.030 --> 02:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
even within the medical profession as
 
02:20:17.690 --> 02:20:17.700 align:start position:0%
good as all the people are
 
02:20:19.969 --> 02:20:19.979 align:start position:0%
there's always going to be a few bad
 
02:20:19.979 --> 02:20:21.770 align:start position:0%
there's always going to be a few bad
apples

02:20:21.770 --> 02:20:21.780 align:start position:0%
apples
 
02:20:24.530 --> 02:20:24.540 align:start position:0%
the news recently had a case in
 
02:20:28.849 --> 02:20:28.859 align:start position:0%
Claremont doctor overstepped
 
02:20:31.969 --> 02:20:31.979 align:start position:0%
um good good behavior boundaries in a
 
02:20:33.830 --> 02:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
criminal sense and is going to face a
 
02:20:37.130 --> 02:20:37.140 align:start position:0%
criminals penalty for that
 
02:20:39.410 --> 02:20:39.420 align:start position:0%
this law is not to address all you
 
02:20:41.929 --> 02:20:41.939 align:start position:0%
people are doing a terrific job in a
 
02:20:43.969 --> 02:20:43.979 align:start position:0%
medical profession
 
02:20:47.389 --> 02:20:47.399 align:start position:0%
gets to address the one or two
 
02:20:49.790 --> 02:20:49.800 align:start position:0%
bad apples that may violate the
 
02:20:52.250 --> 02:20:52.260 align:start position:0%
standards of care the standards of good
 
02:20:55.130 --> 02:20:55.140 align:start position:0%
behavior the standards of society
 
02:20:57.889 --> 02:20:57.899 align:start position:0%
we're trying to protect
 
02:21:01.429 --> 02:21:01.439 align:start position:0%
that unborn child from those few that
 
02:21:04.070 --> 02:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
would violate those standards
 
02:21:06.349 --> 02:21:06.359 align:start position:0%
do you see happen to see that that's a
 
02:21:08.870 --> 02:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
possibility with this bill
 
02:21:12.170 --> 02:21:12.180 align:start position:0%
I I see what your question is I I don't
 
02:21:12.180 --> 02:21:13.730 align:start position:0%
I I see what your question is I I don't
um

02:21:13.730 --> 02:21:13.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:13.740 --> 02:21:15.530 align:start position:0%
um
I

02:21:15.530 --> 02:21:15.540 align:start position:0%
I
 
02:21:17.990 --> 02:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
I think that the unintended consequences
 
02:21:22.790 --> 02:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
of this bill are huge and I think that
 
02:21:22.800 --> 02:21:23.570 align:start position:0%
of this bill are huge and I think that
um

02:21:23.570 --> 02:21:23.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:26.750 --> 02:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
that the circumstances under which you
 
02:21:29.389 --> 02:21:29.399 align:start position:0%
are suggesting are already covered by
 
02:21:32.150 --> 02:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
national National and state laws that
 
02:21:34.550 --> 02:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
prohibit infanticide
 
02:21:36.770 --> 02:21:36.780 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions so this
 
02:21:36.780 --> 02:21:38.389 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions so this
Witness

Emily zagrano and I ask you to oppose HB
346

02:21:58.610 --> 02:21:58.620 align:start position:0%
346
 
02:22:00.889 --> 02:22:00.899 align:start position:0%
this bill will will interfere with
 
02:22:02.690 --> 02:22:02.700 align:start position:0%
Compassionate Care enforce medical
 
02:22:04.550 --> 02:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
interventions that will not affect
 
02:22:04.560 --> 02:22:05.929 align:start position:0%
interventions that will not affect
survival

02:22:05.929 --> 02:22:05.939 align:start position:0%
survival
 
02:22:08.210 --> 02:22:08.220 align:start position:0%
I am a doctor a mother of two living
 
02:22:11.090 --> 02:22:11.100 align:start position:0%
children and as I shared yesterday I am
 
02:22:13.309 --> 02:22:13.319 align:start position:0%
a woman who had two abortions due to
 
02:22:14.870 --> 02:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
complications during a pregnancy with
 
02:22:14.880 --> 02:22:16.250 align:start position:0%
complications during a pregnancy with
twins

02:22:16.250 --> 02:22:16.260 align:start position:0%
twins
 
02:22:19.010 --> 02:22:19.020 align:start position:0%
the first was due to uterine rupture
 
02:22:21.110 --> 02:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
the second abortion was due to a high
 
02:22:22.969 --> 02:22:22.979 align:start position:0%
risk of hemorrhage again
 
02:22:25.730 --> 02:22:25.740 align:start position:0%
and miscarriage before viability born
 
02:22:27.889 --> 02:22:27.899 align:start position:0%
too early for medical interventions to
 
02:22:29.690 --> 02:22:29.700 align:start position:0%
save her life
 
02:22:31.969 --> 02:22:31.979 align:start position:0%
if it had been different and she was
 
02:22:33.770 --> 02:22:33.780 align:start position:0%
born before viability
 
02:22:35.630 --> 02:22:35.640 align:start position:0%
then let me hold her
 
02:22:37.490 --> 02:22:37.500 align:start position:0%
let me love her
 
02:22:41.750 --> 02:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
let her feel my warmth and hear my voice
 
02:22:43.969 --> 02:22:43.979 align:start position:0%
let her father touch her skin and stroke
 
02:22:45.230 --> 02:22:45.240 align:start position:0%
her hair
 
02:22:47.450 --> 02:22:47.460 align:start position:0%
he never got to feel her kit from the
 
02:22:49.670 --> 02:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
womb like I did
 
02:22:52.130 --> 02:22:52.140 align:start position:0%
do not force her into an incubator and
 
02:22:55.250 --> 02:22:55.260 align:start position:0%
medical procedures with lines and tubes
 
02:22:56.650 --> 02:22:56.660 align:start position:0%
and scalpels
 
02:22:59.270 --> 02:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
ventilators and monitors and sterile
 
02:22:59.280 --> 02:23:00.770 align:start position:0%
ventilators and monitors and sterile
gloves

02:23:00.770 --> 02:23:00.780 align:start position:0%
gloves
 
02:23:04.309 --> 02:23:04.319 align:start position:0%
let her time be with us her family
 
02:23:08.389 --> 02:23:08.399 align:start position:0%
and let us decide how that time is spent
 
02:23:11.090 --> 02:23:11.100 align:start position:0%
let us build memories of loving her
 
02:23:14.150 --> 02:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
not watching her suffer
 
02:23:17.150 --> 02:23:17.160 align:start position:0%
families in complex unexpected and often
 
02:23:18.889 --> 02:23:18.899 align:start position:0%
heartbreaking situations like ours
 
02:23:23.030 --> 02:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
deserve support empathy and options
 
02:23:24.710 --> 02:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
we should be able to make difficult
 
02:23:27.110 --> 02:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
decisions with our doctors including
 
02:23:29.210 --> 02:23:29.220 align:start position:0%
comfort care for babies who will not
 
02:23:30.950 --> 02:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
survive regardless of medical
 
02:23:30.960 --> 02:23:33.230 align:start position:0%
survive regardless of medical
interventions

02:23:33.230 --> 02:23:33.240 align:start position:0%
interventions
 
02:23:37.490 --> 02:23:37.500 align:start position:0%
as a mom this needs to be allowed
 
02:23:39.950 --> 02:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
this needs to be legal
 
02:23:41.990 --> 02:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
this is not an appropriate place for
 
02:23:43.910 --> 02:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
political interference
 
02:23:46.130 --> 02:23:46.140 align:start position:0%
these are impossible decisions to be
 
02:23:49.130 --> 02:23:49.140 align:start position:0%
made by parents medical experts the
 
02:23:50.750 --> 02:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
people in that room
 
02:23:53.510 --> 02:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
with all due respect it is not a
 
02:23:55.550 --> 02:23:55.560 align:start position:0%
decision for the people in the
 
02:23:59.150 --> 02:23:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:00.650 --> 02:24:00.660 align:start position:0%
as a doctor
 
02:24:02.270 --> 02:24:02.280 align:start position:0%
I urge you
 
02:24:05.030 --> 02:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
do not force doctors to deny family's
 
02:24:06.349 --> 02:24:06.359 align:start position:0%
Compassionate Care
 
02:24:08.150 --> 02:24:08.160 align:start position:0%
don't threaten them with years of
 
02:24:10.370 --> 02:24:10.380 align:start position:0%
imprisonment to do something that goes
 
02:24:11.929 --> 02:24:11.939 align:start position:0%
against their best medical judgment
 
02:24:15.290 --> 02:24:15.300 align:start position:0%
against all the facts in front of them
 
02:24:17.510 --> 02:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
I ask you to consider the Hippocratic
 
02:24:21.050 --> 02:24:21.060 align:start position:0%
Oath which implores first Do no harm
 
02:24:23.330 --> 02:24:23.340 align:start position:0%
a state mandate for medical
 
02:24:25.670 --> 02:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
interventions that will not change
 
02:24:25.680 --> 02:24:27.050 align:start position:0%
interventions that will not change
survival

02:24:27.050 --> 02:24:27.060 align:start position:0%
survival
 
02:24:31.130 --> 02:24:31.140 align:start position:0%
outcomes is the definition of harm
 
02:24:33.469 --> 02:24:33.479 align:start position:0%
it denies families the opportunity to
 
02:24:35.870 --> 02:24:35.880 align:start position:0%
hold their baby before they pass and
 
02:24:38.270 --> 02:24:38.280 align:start position:0%
piles up unnecessary expensive medical
 
02:24:41.510 --> 02:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
bills for futile care
 
02:24:43.490 --> 02:24:43.500 align:start position:0%
I have attended bereavement groups for
 
02:24:46.010 --> 02:24:46.020 align:start position:0%
pregnancy and infant loss so many
 
02:24:47.750 --> 02:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
families have tokens of their beloved
 
02:24:47.760 --> 02:24:48.590 align:start position:0%
families have tokens of their beloved
babies

02:24:48.590 --> 02:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
babies
 
02:24:52.429 --> 02:24:52.439 align:start position:0%
Footprints locks of hair family photos
 
02:24:54.050 --> 02:24:54.060 align:start position:0%
there was a woman who makes beautiful
 
02:24:56.090 --> 02:24:56.100 align:start position:0%
baby clothes for infants as small as
 
02:24:58.610 --> 02:24:58.620 align:start position:0%
half a pound in order for families to be
 
02:25:00.110 --> 02:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
able to dress their loved ones before
 
02:25:02.090 --> 02:25:02.100 align:start position:0%
saying goodbye
 
02:25:07.630 --> 02:25:07.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:10.010 --> 02:25:10.020 align:start position:0%
two sentences please thank you thank you
 
02:25:12.770 --> 02:25:12.780 align:start position:0%
three sorry there are systems in place
 
02:25:14.450 --> 02:25:14.460 align:start position:0%
that support families in these
 
02:25:16.330 --> 02:25:16.340 align:start position:0%
unimaginable heartbreaking situations
 
02:25:18.710 --> 02:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
this bill does not give room for
 
02:25:21.410 --> 02:25:21.420 align:start position:0%
palliative care do not create a system
 
02:25:23.990 --> 02:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
that makes this terrible time worse no
 
02:25:25.969 --> 02:25:25.979 align:start position:0%
law can be written to thread the needle
 
02:25:28.250 --> 02:25:28.260 align:start position:0%
of these complex situations
 
02:25:31.490 --> 02:25:31.500 align:start position:0%
please reject HP 346 thank you for your

representative Stapleton
 
02:25:41.809 --> 02:25:41.819 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
02:25:43.370 --> 02:25:43.380 align:start position:0%
you cited
 
02:25:45.830 --> 02:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
a very sacred oath
 
02:25:47.389 --> 02:25:47.399 align:start position:0%
Do no harm
 
02:25:51.830 --> 02:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
Do no harm a very sacred oath thanks and
 
02:25:54.710 --> 02:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
it's a good thing we have that oath and
 
02:25:57.710 --> 02:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
it must be followed and by and large
 
02:26:00.050 --> 02:26:00.060 align:start position:0%
medical people follow it
 
02:26:02.690 --> 02:26:02.700 align:start position:0%
to the letter in the spirit
 
02:26:04.790 --> 02:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
what do we do
 
02:26:08.510 --> 02:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
when someone violates that sacred oath
 
02:26:11.570 --> 02:26:11.580 align:start position:0%
we have to have an answer in that
 
02:26:13.730 --> 02:26:13.740 align:start position:0%
situation and thankfully we already do
 
02:26:17.870 --> 02:26:17.880 align:start position:0%
there are current laws that help keep us
 
02:26:21.050 --> 02:26:21.060 align:start position:0%
safe there are medical boards and
 
02:26:24.410 --> 02:26:24.420 align:start position:0%
codes of Ethics that Physicians and
 
02:26:26.150 --> 02:26:26.160 align:start position:0%
other medical providers must answer to
 
02:26:28.969 --> 02:26:28.979 align:start position:0%
if they are violating those that oath
 
02:26:32.330 --> 02:26:32.340 align:start position:0%
there is a process that penalizes it
 
02:26:35.870 --> 02:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
studies it evaluates it reflects on
 
02:26:37.910 --> 02:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
standard of care and it holds people
 
02:26:40.130 --> 02:26:40.140 align:start position:0%
responsible to maintaining their
 
02:26:41.690 --> 02:26:41.700 align:start position:0%
professional oath
 
02:26:46.070 --> 02:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
this law is not needed to keep
 
02:26:48.410 --> 02:26:48.420 align:start position:0%
people in check and make sure that they
 
02:26:50.870 --> 02:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
are doing well by their patients this
 
02:26:54.290 --> 02:26:54.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:56.090 --> 02:26:56.100 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chair members of the

committee and Phyllis woods from Dover
 
02:27:34.670 --> 02:27:34.680 align:start position:0%
uh as a former member of the House
 
02:27:37.429 --> 02:27:37.439 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee I introduce and
 
02:27:40.910 --> 02:27:40.920 align:start position:0%
sponsored this identical Bill 20 years
 
02:27:43.370 --> 02:27:43.380 align:start position:0%
ago and I think the same bill has
 
02:27:46.429 --> 02:27:46.439 align:start position:0%
perhaps come at least once a session
 
02:27:48.349 --> 02:27:48.359 align:start position:0%
since then
 
02:27:51.110 --> 02:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill is really very
 
02:27:51.120 --> 02:27:52.490 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill is really very
clear

02:27:52.490 --> 02:27:52.500 align:start position:0%
clear
 
02:27:56.030 --> 02:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
we're trying to provide for the dignity
 
02:27:59.870 --> 02:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
and the decency and the compassion to
 
02:28:03.770 --> 02:28:03.780 align:start position:0%
care for a very young infant that is
 
02:28:06.349 --> 02:28:06.359 align:start position:0%
born alive that has the today the
 
02:28:10.849 --> 02:28:10.859 align:start position:0%
tenacity to live either if they
 
02:28:13.730 --> 02:28:13.740 align:start position:0%
um were the result of an intentional
 
02:28:19.610 --> 02:28:19.620 align:start position:0%
abortion or perhaps a a a miscarriage or
 
02:28:23.510 --> 02:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
a spontaneous natural abortion
 
02:28:28.490 --> 02:28:28.500 align:start position:0%
I think that after the child is outside
 
02:28:32.150 --> 02:28:32.160 align:start position:0%
of the womb the woman has had the
 
02:28:35.870 --> 02:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
abortion if that is the was the intent
 
02:28:39.410 --> 02:28:39.420 align:start position:0%
and we have a moral imperative at that
 
02:28:42.710 --> 02:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
point to care for the other patient
 
02:28:46.610 --> 02:28:46.620 align:start position:0%
which is the infant there is nothing in
 
02:28:49.250 --> 02:28:49.260 align:start position:0%
this bill that I saw that would require
 
02:28:54.070 --> 02:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
somebody to whisk that child away and
 
02:28:57.290 --> 02:28:57.300 align:start position:0%
resuscitate it or do extraordinary means
 
02:29:00.650 --> 02:29:00.660 align:start position:0%
it's very very clear that we're talking
 
02:29:03.469 --> 02:29:03.479 align:start position:0%
about medically appropriate and
 
02:29:06.730 --> 02:29:06.740 align:start position:0%
reasonable care we had many many
 
02:29:10.429 --> 02:29:10.439 align:start position:0%
testimonies of women and men who had
 
02:29:12.889 --> 02:29:12.899 align:start position:0%
been at the birth of one of these
 
02:29:15.710 --> 02:29:15.720 align:start position:0%
children where the child had just either
 
02:29:19.790 --> 02:29:19.800 align:start position:0%
been thrown in the trash or left on a
 
02:29:24.469 --> 02:29:24.479 align:start position:0%
stainless steel sink to move and to try
 
02:29:27.849 --> 02:29:27.859 align:start position:0%
to breathe until they died
 
02:29:30.710 --> 02:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
what we what we're trying to do in
 
02:29:35.030 --> 02:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
passing along is to not only add to the
 
02:29:38.090 --> 02:29:38.100 align:start position:0%
moral imperative and the compassion of
 
02:29:41.030 --> 02:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
the health care people to to care for
 
02:29:43.250 --> 02:29:43.260 align:start position:0%
that child and to give it very simple
 
02:29:47.809 --> 02:29:47.819 align:start position:0%
Comfort Care to keep it warm perhaps wet
 
02:29:51.070 --> 02:29:51.080 align:start position:0%
the lips are hydrated not do any kind of
 
02:29:54.590 --> 02:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
extraordinary means that would not be
 
02:29:54.600 --> 02:29:56.210 align:start position:0%
extraordinary means that would not be
reasonable

02:29:56.210 --> 02:29:56.220 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
02:29:58.190 --> 02:29:58.200 align:start position:0%
we always
 
02:30:00.110 --> 02:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
um know that
 
02:30:00.120 --> 02:30:01.610 align:start position:0%
um know that
the

02:30:01.610 --> 02:30:01.620 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:30:06.290 --> 02:30:06.300 align:start position:0%
the law requires that if we see any kind
 
02:30:09.530 --> 02:30:09.540 align:start position:0%
of neglect or abuse of a child that has
 
02:30:12.050 --> 02:30:12.060 align:start position:0%
to be reported I don't think anyone has
 
02:30:15.650 --> 02:30:15.660 align:start position:0%
a problem with criminal portion of this
 
02:30:19.190 --> 02:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
we know that abuse or neglect or a
 
02:30:22.910 --> 02:30:22.920 align:start position:0%
deliberate attempts to hurt a child is
 
02:30:26.270 --> 02:30:26.280 align:start position:0%
is a Criminal Intent so I urge you to
 
02:30:30.230 --> 02:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
please please consider passing this very
 
02:30:33.770 --> 02:30:33.780 align:start position:0%
reasonable compassionate law
 
02:30:35.570 --> 02:30:35.580 align:start position:0%
thank you representative would you uh
 
02:30:37.070 --> 02:30:37.080 align:start position:0%

02:30:43.849 --> 02:30:43.859 align:start position:0%

Devon
 
02:30:48.530 --> 02:30:48.540 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:30:50.929 --> 02:30:50.939 align:start position:0%
for your testimony um we were told
 
02:30:53.450 --> 02:30:53.460 align:start position:0%
earlier of scenarios in other states
 
02:30:55.969 --> 02:30:55.979 align:start position:0%
where where some of the things that I
 
02:30:58.070 --> 02:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
think you're speaking of have happened
 
02:30:59.870 --> 02:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
um particularly in Pennsylvania and my
 
02:31:03.290 --> 02:31:03.300 align:start position:0%
understanding is that that provider was
 
02:31:06.230 --> 02:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
prosecuted and successfully
 
02:31:06.240 --> 02:31:06.950 align:start position:0%
prosecuted and successfully
um

02:31:06.950 --> 02:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:10.130 --> 02:31:10.140 align:start position:0%
for those Acts being a former State Rep
 
02:31:12.170 --> 02:31:12.180 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if you could answer do you
 
02:31:14.870 --> 02:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
know of anything in our current statutes
 
02:31:17.389 --> 02:31:17.399 align:start position:0%
that would prevent that prosecution
 
02:31:19.490 --> 02:31:19.500 align:start position:0%
currently in New Hampshire for the
 
02:31:21.110 --> 02:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
things outlined
 
02:31:23.510 --> 02:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
no um you know uh
 
02:31:26.750 --> 02:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
we we all have seen and probably heard
 
02:31:31.730 --> 02:31:31.740 align:start position:0%
of Gosnell and other uh egregious
 
02:31:34.250 --> 02:31:34.260 align:start position:0%
child murderers actually who took
 
02:31:37.550 --> 02:31:37.560 align:start position:0%
proactive action and I think we we must
 
02:31:42.230 --> 02:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
have laws that uh would you know that's
 
02:31:45.230 --> 02:31:45.240 align:start position:0%
that really into intentional killing or
 
02:31:46.929 --> 02:31:46.939 align:start position:0%
harming of a child
 
02:31:49.910 --> 02:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if your question is if
 
02:31:52.250 --> 02:31:52.260 align:start position:0%
anybody has been prosecuted I'm not
 
02:31:55.250 --> 02:31:55.260 align:start position:0%
aware of that I don't I I really would
 
02:31:57.050 --> 02:31:57.060 align:start position:0%
like to believe that that is not
 
02:31:59.690 --> 02:31:59.700 align:start position:0%
happening I'm sorry maybe I wasn't clear
 
02:32:02.090 --> 02:32:02.100 align:start position:0%
about my my question was really whether
 
02:32:04.250 --> 02:32:04.260 align:start position:0%
you're aware of anything in current New
 
02:32:06.410 --> 02:32:06.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire statute that would have made
 
02:32:09.410 --> 02:32:09.420 align:start position:0%
the prosecution as it came out in in
 
02:32:11.510 --> 02:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania not possible in New
 
02:32:11.520 --> 02:32:12.290 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania not possible in New
Hampshire

02:32:12.290 --> 02:32:12.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:32:12.300 --> 02:32:15.410 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
no

02:32:15.410 --> 02:32:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:17.210 --> 02:32:17.220 align:start position:0%
not aware of that would would have made
 
02:32:19.910 --> 02:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
that impossible I think that if that was
 
02:32:22.190 --> 02:32:22.200 align:start position:0%
reported and known we certainly would
 
02:32:24.230 --> 02:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
have laws that would have prosecuted
 
02:32:26.990 --> 02:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
that kind of behavior a representative
 
02:32:28.550 --> 02:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
Divine good question
 
02:32:28.560 --> 02:32:29.870 align:start position:0%
Divine good question
okay

02:32:29.870 --> 02:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:32:32.270 --> 02:32:32.280 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair uh thank
 
02:32:34.429 --> 02:32:34.439 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
02:32:37.389 --> 02:32:37.399 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm looking at the um chapter
 
02:32:41.090 --> 02:32:41.100 align:start position:0%
132a and
 
02:32:43.010 --> 02:32:43.020 align:start position:0%
the current law
 
02:32:43.020 --> 02:32:44.929 align:start position:0%
the current law
States

02:32:44.929 --> 02:32:44.939 align:start position:0%
States
 
02:32:47.270 --> 02:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
that temporary care and control of a
 
02:32:50.270 --> 02:32:50.280 align:start position:0%
child in a hospital or Safe Haven I'm
 
02:32:50.280 --> 02:32:51.290 align:start position:0%
child in a hospital or Safe Haven I'm
sorry

02:32:51.290 --> 02:32:51.300 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
02:32:53.690 --> 02:32:53.700 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to hear you I'm sorry well
 
02:32:55.670 --> 02:32:55.680 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to I'm trying to get my head
 
02:32:59.210 --> 02:32:59.220 align:start position:0%
around why we need this legislation when
 
02:33:01.190 --> 02:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
we already have something in place that
 
02:33:02.990 --> 02:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
does protect the child and the child
 
02:33:04.510 --> 02:33:04.520 align:start position:0%
does go into
 
02:33:09.710 --> 02:33:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:12.530 --> 02:33:12.540 align:start position:0%
I don't think that we necessarily need I
 
02:33:15.110 --> 02:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
as I said we uh the current I don't
 
02:33:16.670 --> 02:33:16.680 align:start position:0%
think anybody has a problem with
 
02:33:18.590 --> 02:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
Criminal Intent if somebody is taking
 
02:33:22.070 --> 02:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
proactive action to do harm to the child
 
02:33:26.450 --> 02:33:26.460 align:start position:0%
I think what this is is we've heard that
 
02:33:30.050 --> 02:33:30.060 align:start position:0%
doctors want to do no harm that they
 
02:33:33.590 --> 02:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
believe that what we're really doing is
 
02:33:36.590 --> 02:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
taking care of the child and giving that
 
02:33:40.250 --> 02:33:40.260 align:start position:0%
comfort care I think this would say
 
02:33:43.309 --> 02:33:43.319 align:start position:0%
for example yesterday I had an
 
02:33:46.070 --> 02:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
obstetrical nurse that was accompanying
 
02:33:48.050 --> 02:33:48.060 align:start position:0%
me she couldn't make it today she said
 
02:33:50.570 --> 02:33:50.580 align:start position:0%
that she was told that if she paid any
 
02:33:53.830 --> 02:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
attention to a child that was born
 
02:33:57.349 --> 02:33:57.359 align:start position:0%
as a result of an abortion uh that if
 
02:33:59.630 --> 02:33:59.640 align:start position:0%
she tried to baptize in her care for it
 
02:34:01.250 --> 02:34:01.260 align:start position:0%
or do it would pay any attention to
 
02:34:03.050 --> 02:34:03.060 align:start position:0%
whatsoever it would have been the last
 
02:34:05.870 --> 02:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
day that she would work the intent was
 
02:34:09.349 --> 02:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
to take care of only the person that had
 
02:34:11.510 --> 02:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
the abortion
 
02:34:16.010 --> 02:34:16.020 align:start position:0%
um I think what this is is would give in
 
02:34:18.950 --> 02:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
besides a moral imperative or what we
 
02:34:22.250 --> 02:34:22.260 align:start position:0%
hope would be a conscience a decision
 
02:34:24.410 --> 02:34:24.420 align:start position:0%
for the health care Personnel to take
 
02:34:27.530 --> 02:34:27.540 align:start position:0%
care of the child it would give them the
 
02:34:32.389 --> 02:34:32.399 align:start position:0%
legal authority to do so and it would be
 
02:34:35.270 --> 02:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
would incentivize them to give at least
 
02:34:38.809 --> 02:34:38.819 align:start position:0%
Comfort Care not extraordinary care just
 
02:34:42.050 --> 02:34:42.060 align:start position:0%
to preserve the human dignity and
 
02:34:44.570 --> 02:34:44.580 align:start position:0%
respect of the individual
 
02:34:47.570 --> 02:34:47.580 align:start position:0%
other questions for this Witness
 
02:34:56.469 --> 02:34:56.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:59.150 --> 02:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
not on
 
02:34:59.160 --> 02:35:08.450 align:start position:0%
not on
foreign

02:35:08.450 --> 02:35:08.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:11.830 --> 02:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
there we go alrighty
 
02:35:14.150 --> 02:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking our questions by
 
02:35:16.010 --> 02:35:16.020 align:start position:0%
the way uh despite the technical
 
02:35:16.020 --> 02:35:17.090 align:start position:0%
the way uh despite the technical
difficulties

02:35:17.090 --> 02:35:17.100 align:start position:0%
difficulties
 
02:35:19.130 --> 02:35:19.140 align:start position:0%
you said that this bill has been
 
02:35:19.140 --> 02:35:20.990 align:start position:0%
you said that this bill has been
presented

02:35:20.990 --> 02:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
presented
 
02:35:23.150 --> 02:35:23.160 align:start position:0%
20 years ago
 
02:35:26.990 --> 02:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:29.929 align:start position:0%
 
how

02:35:29.929 --> 02:35:29.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:32.330 --> 02:35:32.340 align:start position:0%
now your microphone's broken sorry about
 
02:35:35.030 --> 02:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
that I broke your mic
 
02:35:38.809 --> 02:35:38.819 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
02:35:41.690 --> 02:35:41.700 align:start position:0%
the yes I think this has also been
 
02:35:43.670 --> 02:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
sponsored and presented on the federal
 
02:35:47.570 --> 02:35:47.580 align:start position:0%
level multiple times also the arguments
 
02:35:50.030 --> 02:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
for and the arguments against probably
 
02:35:53.510 --> 02:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
haven't changed in 20 years so how is
 
02:35:55.730 --> 02:35:55.740 align:start position:0%
this current bill
 
02:35:59.450 --> 02:35:59.460 align:start position:0%
different and subsequently better than
 
02:36:01.429 --> 02:36:01.439 align:start position:0%
any other bill that's been presented so
 
02:36:01.439 --> 02:36:02.510 align:start position:0%
any other bill that's been presented so
far

02:36:02.510 --> 02:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
far
 
02:36:05.450 --> 02:36:05.460 align:start position:0%
that has not passed so that this bill
 
02:36:08.090 --> 02:36:08.100 align:start position:0%
should be passed because I'm hearing the
 
02:36:11.330 --> 02:36:11.340 align:start position:0%
same Arguments for and against
 
02:36:13.550 --> 02:36:13.560 align:start position:0%
how is this better
 
02:36:16.190 --> 02:36:16.200 align:start position:0%
I don't know if it is substantly
 
02:36:18.710 --> 02:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
different in the wording I think it has
 
02:36:22.070 --> 02:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
been uh streamlined it is
 
02:36:24.889 --> 02:36:24.899 align:start position:0%
even though apparently it is under the
 
02:36:27.349 --> 02:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
intent is unclear to some people it
 
02:36:30.349 --> 02:36:30.359 align:start position:0%
seems crystal clear to the rest of us
 
02:36:34.130 --> 02:36:34.140 align:start position:0%
that we are simply asking for a child to
 
02:36:38.150 --> 02:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
be treated with a dignity and respect
 
02:36:42.889 --> 02:36:42.899 align:start position:0%
um you know the same kind of care that
 
02:36:48.309 --> 02:36:48.319 align:start position:0%
would be given if in fact someone had
 
02:36:51.230 --> 02:36:51.240 align:start position:0%
spontaneously aborted the you know had a
 
02:36:53.929 --> 02:36:53.939 align:start position:0%
spontaneous abortion or a miscarriage in
 
02:36:57.950 --> 02:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
that instant the the uh the parents or
 
02:37:00.650 --> 02:37:00.660 align:start position:0%
the the mother would have some interest
 
02:37:04.130 --> 02:37:04.140 align:start position:0%
in wanting to perhaps take extraordinary
 
02:37:07.610 --> 02:37:07.620 align:start position:0%
means but that by no means is is the
 
02:37:11.330 --> 02:37:11.340 align:start position:0%
case for a child that had not been
 
02:37:15.170 --> 02:37:15.180 align:start position:0%
wanted by the mother you can liken it to
 
02:37:19.010 --> 02:37:19.020 align:start position:0%
the end of life care if in fact someone
 
02:37:21.230 --> 02:37:21.240 align:start position:0%
has advanced directives and they don't
 
02:37:23.270 --> 02:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
want any extra ordinary care then
 
02:37:26.929 --> 02:37:26.939 align:start position:0%
they've taken some proactive action but
 
02:37:30.770 --> 02:37:30.780 align:start position:0%
in the case of like a spontaneous
 
02:37:33.530 --> 02:37:33.540 align:start position:0%
abortion the natural abortion or a
 
02:37:36.469 --> 02:37:36.479 align:start position:0%
miscarriage the the parents at that
 
02:37:40.250 --> 02:37:40.260 align:start position:0%
point have some say as to whether or not
 
02:37:43.790 --> 02:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
they want extraordinary care and in many
 
02:37:46.370 --> 02:37:46.380 align:start position:0%
instances it it doesn't make any sense
 
02:37:49.250 --> 02:37:49.260 align:start position:0%
it probably doesn't make any sense
 
02:37:52.389 --> 02:37:52.399 align:start position:0%
because this calls for appropriate care
 
02:37:55.910 --> 02:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
and appropriate intervention if a child
 
02:37:59.270 --> 02:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
is like less than a pound but is gasping
 
02:38:02.510 --> 02:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
for breath or is moving and showing
 
02:38:06.230 --> 02:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
signs of life with a heartbeat what this
 
02:38:09.349 --> 02:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
bill would say is not only do you have a
 
02:38:11.570 --> 02:38:11.580 align:start position:0%
moral imperative but now you have a
 
02:38:15.349 --> 02:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
legal imperative to give it just the
 
02:38:20.570 --> 02:38:20.580 align:start position:0%
very basic comfort care and to not not
 
02:38:24.050 --> 02:38:24.060 align:start position:0%
subjected to Nicole collect and
 
02:38:27.349 --> 02:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:30.770 --> 02:38:30.780 align:start position:0%
other questions for this week
 
02:38:32.630 --> 02:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
02:38:34.849 --> 02:38:34.859 align:start position:0%

Reverend Allison um or
 
02:38:47.150 --> 02:38:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:03.130 --> 02:39:03.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:05.570 --> 02:39:05.580 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
02:39:08.630 --> 02:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
members excuse me I'm I'm crazy nervous
 
02:39:11.210 --> 02:39:11.220 align:start position:0%
here so my name is Laura Abel I live
 
02:39:12.950 --> 02:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
here can I ask you to get a little
 
02:39:14.090 --> 02:39:14.100 align:start position:0%
closer to the microphone it's really
 
02:39:16.370 --> 02:39:16.380 align:start position:0%
different I live in Matt I'm the name of
 
02:39:18.410 --> 02:39:18.420 align:start position:0%
Laura Abel I live in Madison New
 
02:39:21.110 --> 02:39:21.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm here in opposition to
 
02:39:25.010 --> 02:39:25.020 align:start position:0%
House Bill 346. I'm testifying on this
 
02:39:26.990 --> 02:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
bill today because I know what it means
 
02:39:29.510 --> 02:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
to have a wanted pregnancy to have
 
02:39:32.389 --> 02:39:32.399 align:start position:0%
expected to bring my newborn home and to
 
02:39:32.399 --> 02:39:34.670 align:start position:0%
expected to bring my newborn home and to
experience

02:39:34.670 --> 02:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
experience
 
02:39:37.130 --> 02:39:37.140 align:start position:0%
the devastating loss after the birth of
 
02:39:38.210 --> 02:39:38.220 align:start position:0%
my child
 
02:39:40.910 --> 02:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
I know firsthand how this bill would
 
02:39:44.210 --> 02:39:44.220 align:start position:0%
have impacted my family and me and I do
 
02:39:46.849 --> 02:39:46.859 align:start position:0%
not want anyone to have to give up the
 
02:39:49.309 --> 02:39:49.319 align:start position:0%
last moments you have with your child
 
02:39:53.090 --> 02:39:53.100 align:start position:0%
my story is from 1988 in Nashua New
 
02:39:56.809 --> 02:39:56.819 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I was 23 plus weeks pregnant
 
02:39:59.090 --> 02:39:59.100 align:start position:0%
my husband and I were very excited to
 
02:40:00.530 --> 02:40:00.540 align:start position:0%
become parents
 
02:40:02.630 --> 02:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
I went to the doctor on Tuesday because
 
02:40:04.670 --> 02:40:04.680 align:start position:0%
I was having some cramps the doctor
 
02:40:06.710 --> 02:40:06.720 align:start position:0%
thought I had a urinary tract infection
 
02:40:08.990 --> 02:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
and I was sent home to be on bed rest
 
02:40:10.610 --> 02:40:10.620 align:start position:0%
for two weeks
 
02:40:12.889 --> 02:40:12.899 align:start position:0%
my water broke that evening in the video
 
02:40:15.950 --> 02:40:15.960 align:start position:0%
store a little dated but
 
02:40:17.990 --> 02:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
that's what it was we called the doctor
 
02:40:19.790 --> 02:40:19.800 align:start position:0%
who immediately told me to come to the
 
02:40:22.550 --> 02:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
Maternity Ward and I was admitted right
 
02:40:22.560 --> 02:40:23.809 align:start position:0%
Maternity Ward and I was admitted right
away

02:40:23.809 --> 02:40:23.819 align:start position:0%
away
 
02:40:26.330 --> 02:40:26.340 align:start position:0%
the next day they did an ultrasound
 
02:40:28.969 --> 02:40:28.979 align:start position:0%
determining I had lost a lot of amniotic
 
02:40:32.690 --> 02:40:32.700 align:start position:0%
fluid we were scared and confused we
 
02:40:35.090 --> 02:40:35.100 align:start position:0%
didn't know what losing amniotic fluid
 
02:40:37.910 --> 02:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
meant the doctor told doctors told us I
 
02:40:41.270 --> 02:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
would be in a hospital until delivery
 
02:40:45.050 --> 02:40:45.060 align:start position:0%
each evening I had contractions they
 
02:40:47.330 --> 02:40:47.340 align:start position:0%
gave me antibiotics which stopped the
 
02:40:49.610 --> 02:40:49.620 align:start position:0%
contractions because they knew the
 
02:40:51.950 --> 02:40:51.960 align:start position:0%
chances for her survival would be higher
 
02:40:53.929 --> 02:40:53.939 align:start position:0%
with more time
 
02:40:57.170 --> 02:40:57.180 align:start position:0%
on Sunday morning I had a bloody show I
 
02:40:59.389 --> 02:40:59.399 align:start position:0%
was told this meant my labor had begun
 
02:41:02.270 --> 02:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
in a way that could not be stopped
 
02:41:05.510 --> 02:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
they started preparing my husband and I
 
02:41:08.389 --> 02:41:08.399 align:start position:0%
are the worst case scenario it was
 
02:41:10.190 --> 02:41:10.200 align:start position:0%
possible that my daughter would be born
 
02:41:13.130 --> 02:41:13.140 align:start position:0%
with her eyes to fused shut which they
 
02:41:15.410 --> 02:41:15.420 align:start position:0%
explained to me met her lungs would be
 
02:41:17.469 --> 02:41:17.479 align:start position:0%
underdeveloped and incapable of
 
02:41:19.610 --> 02:41:19.620 align:start position:0%
sustaining her life
 
02:41:21.889 --> 02:41:21.899 align:start position:0%
we held on to Hope though that we would
 
02:41:24.889 --> 02:41:24.899 align:start position:0%
still be able to bring our child home
 
02:41:27.710 --> 02:41:27.720 align:start position:0%
a few hours later my contraction started
 
02:41:30.710 --> 02:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
to lessen and I was given the drug
 
02:41:36.530 --> 02:41:36.540 align:start position:0%
pitocin to reintroduce the contractions
 
02:41:38.870 --> 02:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
Allison Joanne was born a few hours
 
02:41:38.880 --> 02:41:41.150 align:start position:0%
Allison Joanne was born a few hours
later

02:41:41.150 --> 02:41:41.160 align:start position:0%
later
 
02:41:47.330 --> 02:41:47.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:49.070 --> 02:41:49.080 align:start position:0%
when she was born
 
02:41:52.070 --> 02:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
we saw her eyes were still fused shut
 
02:41:54.050 --> 02:41:54.060 align:start position:0%
we knew that meant we only had a small
 
02:41:55.730 --> 02:41:55.740 align:start position:0%
amount of time with her
 
02:41:58.610 --> 02:41:58.620 align:start position:0%
the staff cleaned fade and measured her
 
02:42:01.010 --> 02:42:01.020 align:start position:0%
they swaddled her in a blanket and gave
 
02:42:04.250 --> 02:42:04.260 align:start position:0%
her to my husband and me to hold
 
02:42:06.650 --> 02:42:06.660 align:start position:0%
the staff took also took pictures of
 
02:42:11.750 --> 02:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:13.670 --> 02:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
her heart stopped beating at
 
02:42:17.030 --> 02:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
approximately 40 minutes after her birth
 
02:42:19.690 --> 02:42:19.700 align:start position:0%
we were so grateful to be able to hold
 
02:42:22.250 --> 02:42:22.260 align:start position:0%
hug and protect our precious little
 
02:42:24.469 --> 02:42:24.479 align:start position:0%
daughter for the time she had
 
02:42:27.889 --> 02:42:27.899 align:start position:0%
Allison is buried in Nashua
 
02:42:31.010 --> 02:42:31.020 align:start position:0%
no family should sacrifice any moment
 
02:42:34.670 --> 02:42:34.680 align:start position:0%
with their child my husband and I for my
 
02:42:36.530 --> 02:42:36.540 align:start position:0%
husband and I we were given only 40
 
02:42:38.389 --> 02:42:38.399 align:start position:0%
minutes with our daughter
 
02:42:40.969 --> 02:42:40.979 align:start position:0%
the doctors and staff there supported us
 
02:42:43.490 --> 02:42:43.500 align:start position:0%
in being able to hold and care for her
 
02:42:46.490 --> 02:42:46.500 align:start position:0%
exactly as we wanted to
 
02:42:49.309 --> 02:42:49.319 align:start position:0%
no family should have that opportunity
 
02:42:52.670 --> 02:42:52.680 align:start position:0%
taken away from them no doctor should be
 
02:42:54.590 --> 02:42:54.600 align:start position:0%
forced to act any differently than
 
02:42:57.050 --> 02:42:57.060 align:start position:0%
supporting grieving families in those
 
02:42:57.060 --> 02:42:58.429 align:start position:0%
supporting grieving families in those
moments

02:42:58.429 --> 02:42:58.439 align:start position:0%
moments
 
02:43:00.530 --> 02:43:00.540 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to share my
 
02:43:03.830 --> 02:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
story today I ask again that you vote
 
02:43:08.630 --> 02:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
against House Bill 346 please do not put
 
02:43:11.389 --> 02:43:11.399 align:start position:0%
any families like mine in a harder
 
02:43:14.030 --> 02:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
position than it already is to have this
 
02:43:16.670 --> 02:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
type of loss thank you questions for
 
02:43:19.130 --> 02:43:19.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:21.950 --> 02:43:21.960 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you next is the
 
02:43:23.630 --> 02:43:23.640 align:start position:0%

wemling I think
 
02:43:33.530 --> 02:43:33.540 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:43:35.870 --> 02:43:35.880 align:start position:0%
my name is Reverend Allison Palm I'm a
 
02:43:38.030 --> 02:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
Unitarian Universalist Minister serving
 
02:43:40.010 --> 02:43:40.020 align:start position:0%
the Unitarian Universalist Church of
 
02:43:42.349 --> 02:43:42.359 align:start position:0%
Nashua as well as a resident of Nashua
 
02:43:44.809 --> 02:43:44.819 align:start position:0%
and as a faith leader I'm here to speak
 
02:43:48.590 --> 02:43:48.600 align:start position:0%
in opposition to house bill 346.
 
02:43:50.690 --> 02:43:50.700 align:start position:0%
I know from hearing the conversation
 
02:43:52.969 --> 02:43:52.979 align:start position:0%
this morning that there's lots of talk
 
02:43:56.090 --> 02:43:56.100 align:start position:0%
around this bill and abortion I have
 
02:43:58.309 --> 02:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
also heard today a lot about what the
 
02:44:00.889 --> 02:44:00.899 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill might be
 
02:44:02.990 --> 02:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
I don't believe either of those are
 
02:44:05.750 --> 02:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
helpful instead I want to share my
 
02:44:07.969 --> 02:44:07.979 align:start position:0%
thoughts on this bill from a pastoral
 
02:44:07.979 --> 02:44:09.110 align:start position:0%
thoughts on this bill from a pastoral
perspective

02:44:09.110 --> 02:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
02:44:11.510 --> 02:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
and from the perspective of impact
 
02:44:13.550 --> 02:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
rather than intent
 
02:44:17.030 --> 02:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
as a pastor and in my time working in
 
02:44:19.670 --> 02:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
the hospital as a Chaplain I have seen
 
02:44:22.130 --> 02:44:22.140 align:start position:0%
the vast difference between care that is
 
02:44:25.309 --> 02:44:25.319 align:start position:0%
seeking to extend life and care that is
 
02:44:27.710 --> 02:44:27.720 align:start position:0%
seeking to offer a comfortable death for
 
02:44:30.349 --> 02:44:30.359 align:start position:0%
those with a terminal diagnosis
 
02:44:32.870 --> 02:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
I have seen the Deep value of hospice
 
02:44:35.809 --> 02:44:35.819 align:start position:0%
care which ceases any efforts to prolong
 
02:44:38.510 --> 02:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
life and instead focuses on the comfort
 
02:44:41.750 --> 02:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
of the patient as they are dying and the
 
02:44:44.150 --> 02:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
needs of their family and loved ones as
 
02:44:46.730 --> 02:44:46.740 align:start position:0%
they are saying goodbye
 
02:44:49.490 --> 02:44:49.500 align:start position:0%
House Bill 346 essentially makes it
 
02:44:51.770 --> 02:44:51.780 align:start position:0%
illegal for families to make choices
 
02:44:54.349 --> 02:44:54.359 align:start position:0%
around the kind of care their baby gets
 
02:44:57.650 --> 02:44:57.660 align:start position:0%
in the last moments of that baby's life
 
02:45:00.410 --> 02:45:00.420 align:start position:0%
you have heard stories of families today
 
02:45:03.230 --> 02:45:03.240 align:start position:0%
in this heartbreaking position of having
 
02:45:05.690 --> 02:45:05.700 align:start position:0%
to say goodbye to a baby that they have
 
02:45:06.889 --> 02:45:06.899 align:start position:0%
barely known
 
02:45:10.370 --> 02:45:10.380 align:start position:0%
and it can be even more traumatizing to
 
02:45:12.410 --> 02:45:12.420 align:start position:0%
have their baby taken away for those
 
02:45:15.410 --> 02:45:15.420 align:start position:0%
last minutes or hours in an effort to
 
02:45:18.770 --> 02:45:18.780 align:start position:0%
extend a life that is already lost
 
02:45:21.349 --> 02:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
what families need is support to say
 
02:45:24.110 --> 02:45:24.120 align:start position:0%
goodbye the ability to have their faith
 
02:45:26.630 --> 02:45:26.640 align:start position:0%
leader come in and bless the baby if
 
02:45:29.330 --> 02:45:29.340 align:start position:0%
they choose and the opportunity to be
 
02:45:31.550 --> 02:45:31.560 align:start position:0%
with that baby in the little time that
 
02:45:32.990 --> 02:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
they have
 
02:45:37.309 --> 02:45:37.319 align:start position:0%
I urge you to oppose House Bill 346 and
 
02:45:39.710 --> 02:45:39.720 align:start position:0%
the ways in which this bill would only
 
02:45:42.830 --> 02:45:42.840 align:start position:0%
serve to bring more harm and Trauma to
 
02:45:45.590 --> 02:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
grieving families thank you questions to
 
02:45:48.250 --> 02:45:48.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:53.870 --> 02:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Kathleen doomling uh
 
02:45:55.910 --> 02:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
will be next and after that will be
 
02:46:03.770 --> 02:46:03.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:07.309 --> 02:46:07.319 align:start position:0%
hello my name is Dr Kathleen demling I'm
 
02:46:09.830 --> 02:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
sorry I pronounced your name wrong you
 
02:46:11.809 --> 02:46:11.819 align:start position:0%
were very close
 
02:46:13.910 --> 02:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
my name is Dr Kathleen demling I'm a
 
02:46:15.650 --> 02:46:15.660 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist and today I'm representing
 
02:46:17.570 --> 02:46:17.580 align:start position:0%
myself in the New Hampshire Psychiatric
 
02:46:19.849 --> 02:46:19.859 align:start position:0%
Society in speaking against House Bill
 
02:46:22.610 --> 02:46:22.620 align:start position:0%
346 which threatens the ability of
 
02:46:24.490 --> 02:46:24.500 align:start position:0%
medical providers to perform
 
02:46:27.290 --> 02:46:27.300 align:start position:0%
evidence-based care that is ethical and
 
02:46:29.150 --> 02:46:29.160 align:start position:0%
goes against patients and families
 
02:46:29.160 --> 02:46:30.469 align:start position:0%
goes against patients and families
wishes

02:46:30.469 --> 02:46:30.479 align:start position:0%
wishes
 
02:46:33.290 --> 02:46:33.300 align:start position:0%
we've heard stories today where fetal
 
02:46:36.710 --> 02:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
anomalies have no medical answers
 
02:46:38.210 --> 02:46:38.220 align:start position:0%
when these severe problems are
 
02:46:40.309 --> 02:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
identified mid-pregnancy parents are
 
02:46:42.050 --> 02:46:42.060 align:start position:0%
counseled on their options which are
 
02:46:43.849 --> 02:46:43.859 align:start position:0%
generally to induce an abortion or to
 
02:46:45.889 --> 02:46:45.899 align:start position:0%
deliver and meet their baby the choices
 
02:46:48.050 --> 02:46:48.060 align:start position:0%
made with the understanding that no
 
02:46:49.910 --> 02:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
medical interventions exists that could
 
02:46:51.469 --> 02:46:51.479 align:start position:0%
meaningfully extend their baby's life
 
02:46:53.510 --> 02:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
and that the baby will only survive for
 
02:46:55.910 --> 02:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
hours or maybe minutes after delivery
 
02:46:58.130 --> 02:46:58.140 align:start position:0%
families choosing delivery are choosing
 
02:47:00.050 --> 02:47:00.060 align:start position:0%
to meet their babies and this can be
 
02:47:02.570 --> 02:47:02.580 align:start position:0%
very important to process their grief
 
02:47:05.150 --> 02:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
infant loss is incredibly traumatic It's
 
02:47:07.849 --> 02:47:07.859 align:start position:0%
associated with the development of PTSD
 
02:47:09.530 --> 02:47:09.540 align:start position:0%
research has shown that the risk of
 
02:47:12.290 --> 02:47:12.300 align:start position:0%
developing PTSD is significantly higher
 
02:47:14.270 --> 02:47:14.280 align:start position:0%
among families who felt unsupported by
 
02:47:15.889 --> 02:47:15.899 align:start position:0%
their medical team at the time of the
 
02:47:15.899 --> 02:47:17.450 align:start position:0%
their medical team at the time of the
loss

02:47:17.450 --> 02:47:17.460 align:start position:0%
loss
 
02:47:19.610 --> 02:47:19.620 align:start position:0%
to force a doctor or nurse to go against
 
02:47:21.590 --> 02:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
parents wishes to hold their infant who
 
02:47:23.870 --> 02:47:23.880 align:start position:0%
has minutes to live to take the baby to
 
02:47:26.270 --> 02:47:26.280 align:start position:0%
another space to perform invasive care
 
02:47:28.969 --> 02:47:28.979 align:start position:0%
that's been deemed futile it's more than
 
02:47:31.309 --> 02:47:31.319 align:start position:0%
being unsupportive it's cruel and it
 
02:47:33.170 --> 02:47:33.180 align:start position:0%
strips parents of an opportunity to
 
02:47:34.610 --> 02:47:34.620 align:start position:0%
process their grief
 
02:47:36.349 --> 02:47:36.359 align:start position:0%
and it's traumatizing to all parties
 
02:47:36.359 --> 02:47:37.849 align:start position:0%
and it's traumatizing to all parties
involved

02:47:37.849 --> 02:47:37.859 align:start position:0%
involved
 
02:47:40.070 --> 02:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
in summary this bill threatens the
 
02:47:42.170 --> 02:47:42.180 align:start position:0%
abilities of doctors and nurses to
 
02:47:44.330 --> 02:47:44.340 align:start position:0%
provide Compassionate Care and conflicts
 
02:47:46.429 --> 02:47:46.439 align:start position:0%
with the ethos of Do no harm
 
02:47:48.410 --> 02:47:48.420 align:start position:0%
there are situations where forcing
 
02:47:50.330 --> 02:47:50.340 align:start position:0%
higher levels of Medical Care would
 
02:47:51.590 --> 02:47:51.600 align:start position:0%
contribute to the suffering of the
 
02:47:53.330 --> 02:47:53.340 align:start position:0%
infant and their family
 
02:47:55.790 --> 02:47:55.800 align:start position:0%
withholding invasive painful procedures
 
02:47:57.889 --> 02:47:57.899 align:start position:0%
when there's no evidence that they would
 
02:48:00.650 --> 02:48:00.660 align:start position:0%
be beneficial is not done with the main
 
02:48:03.530 --> 02:48:03.540 align:start position:0%
purpose of hastening death but to avoid
 
02:48:05.870 --> 02:48:05.880 align:start position:0%
pain and suffering and to allow parents
 
02:48:07.610 --> 02:48:07.620 align:start position:0%
to share their child's last moments with
 
02:48:10.250 --> 02:48:10.260 align:start position:0%
them in their arms
 
02:48:12.050 --> 02:48:12.060 align:start position:0%
at the same time
 
02:48:14.210 --> 02:48:14.220 align:start position:0%
starting Comfort Care is a choice made
 
02:48:16.490 --> 02:48:16.500 align:start position:0%
by the medical professional and so I
 
02:48:19.130 --> 02:48:19.140 align:start position:0%
fear with the wording in this bill that
 
02:48:20.630 --> 02:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
this Choice could be interpreted as
 
02:48:20.640 --> 02:48:21.889 align:start position:0%
this Choice could be interpreted as
intent

02:48:21.889 --> 02:48:21.899 align:start position:0%
intent
 
02:48:23.750 --> 02:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
and therefore could be considered
 
02:48:26.330 --> 02:48:26.340 align:start position:0%
intentionally hastening death depending
 
02:48:28.550 --> 02:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
on the motivations of The Interpreter
 
02:48:31.550 --> 02:48:31.560 align:start position:0%

02:48:35.889 --> 02:48:35.899 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you
 
02:48:40.550 --> 02:48:40.560 align:start position:0%
next will be Jason Hennessey and uh
 
02:48:43.429 --> 02:48:43.439 align:start position:0%
the witness after that will be
 
02:48:43.439 --> 02:48:47.809 align:start position:0%
the witness after that will be
uh

02:48:47.809 --> 02:48:47.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:47.819 --> 02:48:51.530 align:start position:0%
 
McKenna

02:48:51.530 --> 02:48:51.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:53.150 --> 02:48:53.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and honorable
 
02:48:54.950 --> 02:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
members of house Judiciary my name is
 
02:48:57.469 --> 02:48:57.479 align:start position:0%
Jason Hennessey I'm here to represent uh
 
02:48:58.969 --> 02:48:58.979 align:start position:0%
the many pro-life people in New
 
02:49:00.710 --> 02:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from New Hampshire and we're
 
02:49:03.110 --> 02:49:03.120 align:start position:0%
part of New Hampshire right to life
 
02:49:08.090 --> 02:49:08.100 align:start position:0%
we stand here to support HP 346
 
02:49:10.550 --> 02:49:10.560 align:start position:0%
so the reason we support that is that we
 
02:49:12.530 --> 02:49:12.540 align:start position:0%
it we support it primarily because we
 
02:49:14.870 --> 02:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
want to protect born children
 
02:49:17.090 --> 02:49:17.100 align:start position:0%
most people almost everybody agrees on
 
02:49:17.100 --> 02:49:18.110 align:start position:0%
most people almost everybody agrees on
this

02:49:18.110 --> 02:49:18.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:49:18.120 --> 02:49:20.450 align:start position:0%
this
uh

02:49:20.450 --> 02:49:20.460 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:49:23.630 --> 02:49:23.640 align:start position:0%
and in particular we are concerned with
 
02:49:25.550 --> 02:49:25.560 align:start position:0%
those infants that actually survive
 
02:49:25.560 --> 02:49:27.110 align:start position:0%
those infants that actually survive
abortions

02:49:27.110 --> 02:49:27.120 align:start position:0%
abortions
 
02:49:28.790 --> 02:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
because in their in the abortion room
 
02:49:30.590 --> 02:49:30.600 align:start position:0%
you have at least two people who have
 
02:49:33.469 --> 02:49:33.479 align:start position:0%
expressed intent to harm that child
 
02:49:36.349 --> 02:49:36.359 align:start position:0%
and it is uh the state has an interest
 
02:49:38.090 --> 02:49:38.100 align:start position:0%
in protecting
 
02:49:41.330 --> 02:49:41.340 align:start position:0%
the the right to life of every every one
 
02:49:44.210 --> 02:49:44.220 align:start position:0%
of its citizens and so for that reason
 
02:49:45.530 --> 02:49:45.540 align:start position:0%
we support
 
02:49:49.130 --> 02:49:49.140 align:start position:0%
uh we support this this legislation
 
02:49:50.929 --> 02:49:50.939 align:start position:0%
right you've heard a cup you've heard
 
02:49:52.910 --> 02:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
Gosnell referenced a couple of times how
 
02:49:56.450 --> 02:49:56.460 align:start position:0%
that couldn't happen here uh he he was
 
02:49:58.429 --> 02:49:58.439 align:start position:0%
convicted primarily because he actively
 
02:49:59.929 --> 02:49:59.939 align:start position:0%
killed the children
 
02:50:02.270 --> 02:50:02.280 align:start position:0%
but we're concerned about what about a
 
02:50:04.010 --> 02:50:04.020 align:start position:0%
child that's born from an abortion and
 
02:50:07.190 --> 02:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
is left there to starve or dehydrate
 
02:50:09.410 --> 02:50:09.420 align:start position:0%
or something like that that is that's
 
02:50:10.969 --> 02:50:10.979 align:start position:0%
our primary concern
 
02:50:12.349 --> 02:50:12.359 align:start position:0%
uh you've heard that this is a
 
02:50:14.270 --> 02:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
theoretical concern
 
02:50:16.610 --> 02:50:16.620 align:start position:0%
well it's murky here in New Hampshire we
 
02:50:18.590 --> 02:50:18.600 align:start position:0%
don't have statistics the people who
 
02:50:21.830 --> 02:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
would know don't usually talk uh in in
 
02:50:24.110 --> 02:50:24.120 align:start position:0%
definites but they they don't like to
 
02:50:25.849 --> 02:50:25.859 align:start position:0%
give statistics of what they know
 
02:50:28.070 --> 02:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
from what I've heard
 
02:50:30.410 --> 02:50:30.420 align:start position:0%
and uh according to the family research
 
02:50:33.290 --> 02:50:33.300 align:start position:0%
Council they surveyed eight states that
 
02:50:35.630 --> 02:50:35.640 align:start position:0%
keep statistics on infants born alive
 
02:50:38.750 --> 02:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
after after abortion and they found 245
 
02:50:38.760 --> 02:50:39.830 align:start position:0%
after after abortion and they found 245
cases

02:50:39.830 --> 02:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
cases
 
02:50:42.770 --> 02:50:42.780 align:start position:0%
but that is a vast vast underestimate
 
02:50:44.210 --> 02:50:44.220 align:start position:0%
because there's only eight states that
 
02:50:45.170 --> 02:50:45.180 align:start position:0%
keep them
 
02:50:47.690 --> 02:50:47.700 align:start position:0%
and and it and we have we don't know
 
02:50:51.469 --> 02:50:51.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:53.990 --> 02:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
some of them grow up some of them are
 
02:50:57.170 --> 02:50:57.180 align:start position:0%
like Melissa Odin and and you even heard
 
02:50:59.090 --> 02:50:59.100 align:start position:0%
a gentleman earlier who who read a
 
02:51:00.469 --> 02:51:00.479 align:start position:0%
statement from the abortion survivors
 
02:51:02.389 --> 02:51:02.399 align:start position:0%
Network so there's enough of them to
 
02:51:03.469 --> 02:51:03.479 align:start position:0%
form a network
 
02:51:05.330 --> 02:51:05.340 align:start position:0%
so there's obvi this is obviously not a
 
02:51:07.130 --> 02:51:07.140 align:start position:0%
theoretical case
 
02:51:09.590 --> 02:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh I've heard it said earlier that we
 
02:51:11.270 --> 02:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
should be depending on federal law but
 
02:51:12.590 --> 02:51:12.600 align:start position:0%
the problem with federal law is that
 
02:51:14.210 --> 02:51:14.220 align:start position:0%
it's very finicky in terms of
 
02:51:16.190 --> 02:51:16.200 align:start position:0%
enforcement it depends on the
 
02:51:17.809 --> 02:51:17.819 align:start position:0%
administration that's there and anybody
 
02:51:19.309 --> 02:51:19.319 align:start position:0%
here I'm sure can come up with all sorts
 
02:51:21.349 --> 02:51:21.359 align:start position:0%
of cases where something was illegal
 
02:51:22.849 --> 02:51:22.859 align:start position:0%
under one Administration and then the
 
02:51:24.230 --> 02:51:24.240 align:start position:0%
next Administration decided not to
 
02:51:25.309 --> 02:51:25.319 align:start position:0%
enforce that
 
02:51:27.110 --> 02:51:27.120 align:start position:0%
so we need something here in New
 
02:51:28.370 --> 02:51:28.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to make sure that the right to
 
02:51:30.830 --> 02:51:30.840 align:start position:0%
life is preserved here in New Hampshire
 
02:51:32.750 --> 02:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
yesterday this committee heard two bills
 
02:51:34.490 --> 02:51:34.500 align:start position:0%
to roll back the feedlife protection act
 
02:51:37.429 --> 02:51:37.439 align:start position:0%
that protects unborn children at at six
 
02:51:37.439 --> 02:51:38.929 align:start position:0%
that protects unborn children at at six
months

02:51:38.929 --> 02:51:38.939 align:start position:0%
months
 
02:51:40.250 --> 02:51:40.260 align:start position:0%
and this would illegal this would
 
02:51:43.130 --> 02:51:43.140 align:start position:0%
legalize abortion through birth
 
02:51:45.050 --> 02:51:45.060 align:start position:0%
if if you're planning on supporting that
 
02:51:46.490 --> 02:51:46.500 align:start position:0%
I would ask you to really consider
 
02:51:49.070 --> 02:51:49.080 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill because if if that
 
02:51:51.290 --> 02:51:51.300 align:start position:0%
is rolled back you could have seven or
 
02:51:54.590 --> 02:51:54.600 align:start position:0%
eight month uh abortions where this
 
02:51:56.330 --> 02:51:56.340 align:start position:0%
child could really survive and really
 
02:51:57.469 --> 02:51:57.479 align:start position:0%
have a good chance of thriving
 
02:51:57.479 --> 02:51:59.870 align:start position:0%
have a good chance of thriving
afterwards

02:51:59.870 --> 02:51:59.880 align:start position:0%
afterwards
 
02:52:02.090 --> 02:52:02.100 align:start position:0%
in terms of a political reaction in
 
02:52:04.969 --> 02:52:04.979 align:start position:0%
terms of the political reality reality
 
02:52:07.730 --> 02:52:07.740 align:start position:0%
for those who disagree uh with this uh
 
02:52:10.130 --> 02:52:10.140 align:start position:0%
with the bill as it is I didn't hear any
 
02:52:12.950 --> 02:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
testimony opposing protecting survivors
 
02:52:14.150 --> 02:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
of abortion
 
02:52:16.370 --> 02:52:16.380 align:start position:0%
I heard I heard about it more with the
 
02:52:19.490 --> 02:52:19.500 align:start position:0%
wanted children and and tragic tragic
 
02:52:19.500 --> 02:52:21.110 align:start position:0%
wanted children and and tragic tragic
circumstances

02:52:21.110 --> 02:52:21.120 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
02:52:23.030 --> 02:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
so I'd ask it if the committee would be
 
02:52:25.610 --> 02:52:25.620 align:start position:0%
interested in supporting a bill that was
 
02:52:28.370 --> 02:52:28.380 align:start position:0%
restricted to just abortion survivors if
 
02:52:30.410 --> 02:52:30.420 align:start position:0%
that would create more consensus thank
 
02:52:35.030 --> 02:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:37.250 --> 02:52:37.260 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much sir
 
02:52:39.790 --> 02:52:39.800 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry representative Divine sorry
 
02:52:43.849 --> 02:52:43.859 align:start position:0%
are there any current cases of babies
 
02:52:47.230 --> 02:52:47.240 align:start position:0%
being born say within the last two years
 
02:52:50.929 --> 02:52:50.939 align:start position:0%
of infants being born after an abortion
 
02:52:54.650 --> 02:52:54.660 align:start position:0%
that have survived and can you speak to
 
02:52:57.590 --> 02:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
any any instances of that in this state
 
02:52:59.210 --> 02:52:59.220 align:start position:0%
so thank you for your question
 
02:53:02.450 --> 02:53:02.460 align:start position:0%
representative uh there's no abortion
 
02:53:05.269 --> 02:53:05.279 align:start position:0%
statistics we don't know uh we don't
 
02:53:08.090 --> 02:53:08.100 align:start position:0%
know what happens and as far as it's
 
02:53:11.330 --> 02:53:11.340 align:start position:0%
very murky so to my knowledge the answer
 
02:53:13.250 --> 02:53:13.260 align:start position:0%
is no but I don't know that we would
 
02:53:15.170 --> 02:53:15.180 align:start position:0%
know if it did happen
 
02:53:17.809 --> 02:53:17.819 align:start position:0%
I I have a question do you think that
 
02:53:19.969 --> 02:53:19.979 align:start position:0%
the reason that there are no statistics
 
02:53:23.750 --> 02:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
is that neither side wants it because if
 
02:53:28.070 --> 02:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
the if the pro-choice side had the
 
02:53:31.330 --> 02:53:31.340 align:start position:0%
statistics it might show how how
 
02:53:34.490 --> 02:53:34.500 align:start position:0%
unintrusive the current law is and on
 
02:53:36.230 --> 02:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
the other side if the pro-life people
 
02:53:39.050 --> 02:53:39.060 align:start position:0%
had it it might show how unintrusive the
 
02:53:40.969 --> 02:53:40.979 align:start position:0%
present law is and it's in neither
 
02:53:43.130 --> 02:53:43.140 align:start position:0%
side's interest to say that because it
 
02:53:45.170 --> 02:53:45.180 align:start position:0%
undercuts both sides arguments do you
 
02:53:47.389 --> 02:53:47.399 align:start position:0%
think that might be true so that is a
 
02:53:49.309 --> 02:53:49.319 align:start position:0%
very interesting proposition Mr chairman
 
02:53:52.309 --> 02:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
uh I can speak for the pro-life side and
 
02:53:53.929 --> 02:53:53.939 align:start position:0%
only for the pro-life side that we've
 
02:53:56.210 --> 02:53:56.220 align:start position:0%
been fighting for a statistics bill for
 
02:53:58.550 --> 02:53:58.560 align:start position:0%
at least 15 years probably longer with
 
02:53:59.990 --> 02:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
people who've been around longer than I
 
02:54:01.790 --> 02:54:01.800 align:start position:0%
have know about that
 
02:54:03.530 --> 02:54:03.540 align:start position:0%
um before that but we have been fighting
 
02:54:06.469 --> 02:54:06.479 align:start position:0%
vigorously for this uh for one reason or
 
02:54:08.269 --> 02:54:08.279 align:start position:0%
another it just comes up that people
 
02:54:10.130 --> 02:54:10.140 align:start position:0%
find problems with it
 
02:54:12.830 --> 02:54:12.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you all right other questions
 
02:54:15.050 --> 02:54:15.060 align:start position:0%
for this Witness
 
02:54:16.790 --> 02:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you Mr

02:54:59.690 --> 02:54:59.700 align:start position:0%
pregnancy at 16 weeks at 18 weeks all
 
02:55:02.030 --> 02:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
the way up we work so hard to support
 
02:55:05.150 --> 02:55:05.160 align:start position:0%
the recovery of our patients to
 
02:55:08.990 --> 02:55:09.000 align:start position:0%
defend the life of the neonate but I
 
02:55:10.309 --> 02:55:10.319 align:start position:0%
just want to let you know that this bill
 
02:55:13.070 --> 02:55:13.080 align:start position:0%
the way it's written doesn't work and it
 
02:55:16.490 --> 02:55:16.500 align:start position:0%
would absolutely impede our ability to
 
02:55:19.550 --> 02:55:19.560 align:start position:0%
help transition the baby and the parents
 
02:55:22.610 --> 02:55:22.620 align:start position:0%
in a kind and compassionate way and I
 
02:55:24.290 --> 02:55:24.300 align:start position:0%
don't think I'll do a great job of
 
02:55:25.490 --> 02:55:25.500 align:start position:0%
getting into the weeds of the
 
02:55:27.889 --> 02:55:27.899 align:start position:0%
hypothetical stuff but I was just like a
 
02:55:30.050 --> 02:55:30.060 align:start position:0%
citizen who is here who does this work
 
02:55:32.150 --> 02:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
on a daily basis this bill doesn't work
 
02:55:35.150 --> 02:55:35.160 align:start position:0%
because we're getting into
 
02:55:37.309 --> 02:55:37.319 align:start position:0%
babies who survived abortion but any
 
02:55:39.530 --> 02:55:39.540 align:start position:0%
born alive infant including but not
 
02:55:42.530 --> 02:55:42.540 align:start position:0%
limited to one born alive so this wraps
 
02:55:44.210 --> 02:55:44.220 align:start position:0%
up all the babies that we take care of
 
02:55:46.670 --> 02:55:46.680 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't be able to support them in a
 
02:55:48.050 --> 02:55:48.060 align:start position:0%
way and I think that one thing that
 
02:55:49.550 --> 02:55:49.560 align:start position:0%
represents Stapleton has said a couple
 
02:55:52.010 --> 02:55:52.020 align:start position:0%
times is well you're not hastening care
 
02:55:54.170 --> 02:55:54.180 align:start position:0%
you're not hastening sorry you're not
 
02:55:55.370 --> 02:55:55.380 align:start position:0%
hastening the death you're just
 
02:55:57.410 --> 02:55:57.420 align:start position:0%
providing Compassionate Care but I think
 
02:55:58.910 --> 02:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
what we've heard before other medical
 
02:56:00.830 --> 02:56:00.840 align:start position:0%
professionals say is we're terrified
 
02:56:03.590 --> 02:56:03.600 align:start position:0%
that providing the like compassionate
 
02:56:05.830 --> 02:56:05.840 align:start position:0%
loving support of the family
 
02:56:08.750 --> 02:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
transitioning would be inter sorry would
 
02:56:10.429 --> 02:56:10.439 align:start position:0%
be interpreted as hastening the death
 
02:56:11.990 --> 02:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
and we just want to be able to do our
 
02:56:14.030 --> 02:56:14.040 align:start position:0%
job so please oppose this law it doesn't
 
02:56:17.150 --> 02:56:17.160 align:start position:0%
work on the in the reality on the ground
 
02:56:21.349 --> 02:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:24.290 --> 02:56:24.300 align:start position:0%
yes representative Perez
 
02:56:26.690 --> 02:56:26.700 align:start position:0%
is it lawsuits that you all are afraid
 
02:56:29.929 --> 02:56:29.939 align:start position:0%
of oh no absolutely not it's more the
 
02:56:31.910 --> 02:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
exact moment when that family is
 
02:56:34.130 --> 02:56:34.140 align:start position:0%
grieving when we're paralyzed with wait
 
02:56:36.050 --> 02:56:36.060 align:start position:0%
a minute what are we allowed to do when
 
02:56:38.210 --> 02:56:38.220 align:start position:0%
that mother or father or parent has
 
02:56:40.550 --> 02:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
asked to be given their baby and we want
 
02:56:42.349 --> 02:56:42.359 align:start position:0%
to care for them and support them and
 
02:56:44.809 --> 02:56:44.819 align:start position:0%
allow them to process that moment we're
 
02:56:46.849 --> 02:56:46.859 align:start position:0%
worried that the ambiguity in this bill
 
02:56:49.910 --> 02:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
will cause us to pause and paralyze and
 
02:56:52.250 --> 02:56:52.260 align:start position:0%
not provide the excellent compassionate
 
02:56:54.650 --> 02:56:54.660 align:start position:0%
loving care we know how to do
 
02:56:56.929 --> 02:56:56.939 align:start position:0%
other questions for this wave
 
02:57:01.190 --> 02:57:01.200 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you uh Jamie Wilder
 
02:57:03.830 --> 02:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
or Jama Wilder I think it's
 
02:57:06.290 --> 02:57:06.300 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure but Wilder is the last name
 
02:57:06.300 --> 02:57:07.309 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure but Wilder is the last name
anyway

02:57:07.309 --> 02:57:07.319 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
02:57:11.870 --> 02:57:11.880 align:start position:0%
hi there yes it's Jama Wilder okay
 
02:57:15.530 --> 02:57:15.540 align:start position:0%
so I actually unexpectedly came in um to
 
02:57:17.150 --> 02:57:17.160 align:start position:0%
sign in and I saw this bill was still
 
02:57:19.610 --> 02:57:19.620 align:start position:0%
going and I was compelled to come in and
 
02:57:22.429 --> 02:57:22.439 align:start position:0%
speak on it I am um I've lived in New
 
02:57:26.030 --> 02:57:26.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for 42 years I'm a mother of
 
02:57:30.429 --> 02:57:30.439 align:start position:0%
five children and I'm also a birth Doula
 
02:57:33.170 --> 02:57:33.180 align:start position:0%
part-time obviously a lot changed since
 
02:57:38.090 --> 02:57:38.100 align:start position:0%
covid but I also consider life very very
 
02:57:41.269 --> 02:57:41.279 align:start position:0%
very important I have had two
 
02:57:43.849 --> 02:57:43.859 align:start position:0%
miscarriages myself and I have had
 
02:57:46.910 --> 02:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
postpartum with two of my children and
 
02:57:49.309 --> 02:57:49.319 align:start position:0%
so I can speak to many of the things
 
02:57:51.710 --> 02:57:51.720 align:start position:0%
that were said today
 
02:57:53.690 --> 02:57:53.700 align:start position:0%
something in my life
 
02:57:56.090 --> 02:57:56.100 align:start position:0%
um happened last April where my father
 
02:57:59.450 --> 02:57:59.460 align:start position:0%
went into cardiac arrest at my house and
 
02:58:02.090 --> 02:58:02.100 align:start position:0%
in that moment I had the decision to try
 
02:58:04.010 --> 02:58:04.020 align:start position:0%
to save his life or wait for someone
 
02:58:05.510 --> 02:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
else to show up
 
02:58:09.349 --> 02:58:09.359 align:start position:0%
he was 70 years old and my my son and I
 
02:58:12.530 --> 02:58:12.540 align:start position:0%
went into chest compressions and breaths
 
02:58:15.110 --> 02:58:15.120 align:start position:0%
and we kept him alive until help was
 
02:58:18.290 --> 02:58:18.300 align:start position:0%
able to arrive for the next several
 
02:58:18.300 --> 02:58:19.550 align:start position:0%
able to arrive for the next several
hours

02:58:19.550 --> 02:58:19.560 align:start position:0%
hours
 
02:58:21.769 --> 02:58:21.779 align:start position:0%
um he was brought to the hospital and
 
02:58:23.510 --> 02:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
they did everything they could to keep
 
02:58:24.650 --> 02:58:24.660 align:start position:0%
him alive
 
02:58:24.660 --> 02:58:26.210 align:start position:0%
him alive
he

02:58:26.210 --> 02:58:26.220 align:start position:0%
he
 
02:58:28.370 --> 02:58:28.380 align:start position:0%
um had brain damage from the lack of
 
02:58:31.550 --> 02:58:31.560 align:start position:0%
oxygen that went to his brain and they
 
02:58:34.730 --> 02:58:34.740 align:start position:0%
gave us the option at that moment to
 
02:58:36.530 --> 02:58:36.540 align:start position:0%
basically take him off of the medicine
 
02:58:38.750 --> 02:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
that was keeping him alive
 
02:58:41.929 --> 02:58:41.939 align:start position:0%
and we came in we said goodbye all of
 
02:58:44.150 --> 02:58:44.160 align:start position:0%
the stories that you heard today were
 
02:58:44.160 --> 02:58:45.190 align:start position:0%
the stories that you heard today were
false

02:58:45.190 --> 02:58:45.200 align:start position:0%
false
 
02:58:48.530 --> 02:58:48.540 align:start position:0%
falsified in the fact that they would
 
02:58:51.769 --> 02:58:51.779 align:start position:0%
not allow a family to have that moment
 
02:58:54.910 --> 02:58:54.920 align:start position:0%
with their child what this bill is doing
 
02:58:59.330 --> 02:58:59.340 align:start position:0%
is it is saving babies that are being
 
02:59:04.550 --> 02:59:04.560 align:start position:0%
born that are unwanted that are there
 
02:59:06.349 --> 02:59:06.359 align:start position:0%
that the parents are saying that they
 
02:59:08.990 --> 02:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
want their baby to be murdered and the
 
02:59:11.570 --> 02:59:11.580 align:start position:0%
argument that is always put forth is
 
02:59:14.030 --> 02:59:14.040 align:start position:0%
that when you're aborting a child it's
 
02:59:15.590 --> 02:59:15.600 align:start position:0%
not really a life
 
02:59:17.929 --> 02:59:17.939 align:start position:0%
but once that child comes out of the
 
02:59:21.170 --> 02:59:21.180 align:start position:0%
womb and is breathing on its own or has
 
02:59:24.769 --> 02:59:24.779 align:start position:0%
is viable to be saved they are saying
 
02:59:26.769 --> 02:59:26.779 align:start position:0%
let the baby go they don't need any help
 
02:59:29.990 --> 02:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
well each of you have to look at
 
02:59:32.090 --> 02:59:32.100 align:start position:0%
yourselves and say if I went into
 
02:59:35.210 --> 02:59:35.220 align:start position:0%
cardiac arrest right now would I want a
 
02:59:37.490 --> 02:59:37.500 align:start position:0%
doctor to decide whether or not my life
 
02:59:41.690 --> 02:59:41.700 align:start position:0%
was worth saving or my loved one or my
 
02:59:44.929 --> 02:59:44.939 align:start position:0%
child's because if you can't say that a
 
02:59:47.030 --> 02:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
life is a life and it's important to
 
02:59:49.610 --> 02:59:49.620 align:start position:0%
save and to fight for that life
 
02:59:52.309 --> 02:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
then why when we give parents the option
 
02:59:55.370 --> 02:59:55.380 align:start position:0%
at two years old to say well this
 
02:59:56.929 --> 02:59:56.939 align:start position:0%
child's going to cost me a lot medical
 
02:59:59.030 --> 02:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
bills so we might as well just let them
 
03:00:00.410 --> 03:00:00.420 align:start position:0%
die now
 
03:00:02.809 --> 03:00:02.819 align:start position:0%
you're seeing our society in the
 
03:00:05.030 --> 03:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
wickedness in it and the perverseness
 
03:00:07.210 --> 03:00:07.220 align:start position:0%
that they're even talking about a
 
03:00:10.790 --> 03:00:10.800 align:start position:0%
assisted suicides and bills coming up
 
03:00:16.910 --> 03:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
I have so much appreciation for life and
 
03:00:19.309 --> 03:00:19.319 align:start position:0%
the sad thing is that the doctors that
 
03:00:21.230 --> 03:00:21.240 align:start position:0%
are standing up I don't know if they do
 
03:00:23.929 --> 03:00:23.939 align:start position:0%
the abortions themselves I don't know if
 
03:00:26.929 --> 03:00:26.939 align:start position:0%
they've held a teeny tiny baby in their
 
03:00:31.610 --> 03:00:31.620 align:start position:0%
hands and said this life isn't worth it
 
03:00:35.349 --> 03:00:35.359 align:start position:0%
but all this bill is doing is asking
 
03:00:38.990 --> 03:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
immoral people that do not want to fight
 
03:00:42.889 --> 03:00:42.899 align:start position:0%
to give life a chance
 
03:00:45.290 --> 03:00:45.300 align:start position:0%
no maybe you're getting you're really at
 
03:00:46.849 --> 03:00:46.859 align:start position:0%
the end of your time so I'd ask you to
 
03:00:48.710 --> 03:00:48.720 align:start position:0%
sum up if you would please
 
03:00:50.630 --> 03:00:50.640 align:start position:0%
they were asking
 
03:00:53.510 --> 03:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
for a chance to make immoral people
 
03:00:57.590 --> 03:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
moral and to have those doctors be
 
03:01:00.530 --> 03:01:00.540 align:start position:0%
standing up and and having to
 
03:01:03.469 --> 03:01:03.479 align:start position:0%
look at the oath that they took that
 
03:01:05.510 --> 03:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
they do care about life
 
03:01:10.910 --> 03:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
and I I support this bill and I pray and
 
03:01:14.650 --> 03:01:14.660 align:start position:0%
I ask each of you to look at imagine
 
03:01:17.929 --> 03:01:17.939 align:start position:0%
what a tiny baby in your hands breathing
 
03:01:19.070 --> 03:01:19.080 align:start position:0%
would be
 
03:01:21.889 --> 03:01:21.899 align:start position:0%
and and think about the fact that you're
 
03:01:26.210 --> 03:01:26.220 align:start position:0%
fighting to save that child
 
03:01:28.429 --> 03:01:28.439 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you questions for this
 
03:01:28.439 --> 03:01:30.830 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you questions for this

03:02:14.389 --> 03:02:14.399 align:start position:0%
want to invite you with me into a late
 
03:02:17.030 --> 03:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
night hospital room for a moment
 
03:02:19.070 --> 03:02:19.080 align:start position:0%
a young mom and dad are in the
 
03:02:21.230 --> 03:02:21.240 align:start position:0%
postpartum Wing having just given birth
 
03:02:23.929 --> 03:02:23.939 align:start position:0%
to a long-awaited baby
 
03:02:26.450 --> 03:02:26.460 align:start position:0%
he is 23 weeks old
 
03:02:28.790 --> 03:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
he has a fatal fetal anomaly that was
 
03:02:32.030 --> 03:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
not previously detected and did not live
 
03:02:35.510 --> 03:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
but for some two brief moments after he
 
03:02:36.710 --> 03:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
was born
 
03:02:39.950 --> 03:02:39.960 align:start position:0%
his parents have asked me to baptize him
 
03:02:42.889 --> 03:02:42.899 align:start position:0%
with his tender fleeting name
 
03:02:45.170 --> 03:02:45.180 align:start position:0%
they want to hold him
 
03:02:46.849 --> 03:02:46.859 align:start position:0%
they want to pray
 
03:02:49.070 --> 03:02:49.080 align:start position:0%
and they want to say goodbye
 
03:02:52.550 --> 03:02:52.560 align:start position:0%
they are traumatized and exhausted they
 
03:02:54.889 --> 03:02:54.899 align:start position:0%
want only in this moment to have a holy
 
03:02:57.110 --> 03:02:57.120 align:start position:0%
and a tender ending
 
03:02:59.269 --> 03:02:59.279 align:start position:0%
this is one of many stories I could tell
 
03:03:01.429 --> 03:03:01.439 align:start position:0%
you about parents in profound and
 
03:03:04.190 --> 03:03:04.200 align:start position:0%
soul-crushing grief over deeply wanted
 
03:03:07.790 --> 03:03:07.800 align:start position:0%
babies with two short lives every one of
 
03:03:10.370 --> 03:03:10.380 align:start position:0%
those stories is sacred and
 
03:03:10.380 --> 03:03:11.809 align:start position:0%
those stories is sacred and
heartbreaking

03:03:11.809 --> 03:03:11.819 align:start position:0%
heartbreaking
 
03:03:13.910 --> 03:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
to deny these families these essential
 
03:03:16.370 --> 03:03:16.380 align:start position:0%
moments would be inhumane
 
03:03:18.710 --> 03:03:18.720 align:start position:0%
every physician and every medical team I
 
03:03:21.230 --> 03:03:21.240 align:start position:0%
worked with went above and beyond to
 
03:03:23.269 --> 03:03:23.279 align:start position:0%
save the life of every infant they cared
 
03:03:25.730 --> 03:03:25.740 align:start position:0%
for without exception but it is
 
03:03:27.469 --> 03:03:27.479 align:start position:0%
essential that we are clear that this
 
03:03:29.750 --> 03:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
bill does not only apply to a limited
 
03:03:32.210 --> 03:03:32.220 align:start position:0%
set of medical circumstances the
 
03:03:33.790 --> 03:03:33.800 align:start position:0%
language is Broad
 
03:03:35.929 --> 03:03:35.939 align:start position:0%
intentional or not
 
03:03:37.550 --> 03:03:37.560 align:start position:0%
that is the case
 
03:03:39.230 --> 03:03:39.240 align:start position:0%
we have a moral and an ethical
 
03:03:41.510 --> 03:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility to offer the best care to
 
03:03:43.670 --> 03:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
infants and parents I don't think any of
 
03:03:46.910 --> 03:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
us would deny that sometimes that care
 
03:03:50.030 --> 03:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
means allowing parents the Time to Say
 
03:03:52.250 --> 03:03:52.260 align:start position:0%
Goodbye that they don't want to say
 
03:03:54.769 --> 03:03:54.779 align:start position:0%
not to do so would be harmful
 
03:03:56.990 --> 03:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
I don't believe for a moment one of us
 
03:03:58.849 --> 03:03:58.859 align:start position:0%
in this room wants to end the life of a
 
03:04:01.730 --> 03:04:01.740 align:start position:0%
baby prematurely that is inflammatory
 
03:04:03.950 --> 03:04:03.960 align:start position:0%
rhetoric that is not helpful to this
 
03:04:06.469 --> 03:04:06.479 align:start position:0%
conversation but as someone who has been
 
03:04:08.570 --> 03:04:08.580 align:start position:0%
in many hospital rooms with babies who
 
03:04:10.849 --> 03:04:10.859 align:start position:0%
simply could not survive I am
 
03:04:13.309 --> 03:04:13.319 align:start position:0%
heartbroken that these incredibly Brave
 
03:04:15.410 --> 03:04:15.420 align:start position:0%
voices that we heard today had to tell
 
03:04:17.990 --> 03:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
these stories in public so families
 
03:04:19.790 --> 03:04:19.800 align:start position:0%
would not be further harmed in the
 
03:04:22.370 --> 03:04:22.380 align:start position:0%
hardest moment of their lives while the
 
03:04:25.010 --> 03:04:25.020 align:start position:0%
intention of this bill may be narrow the
 
03:04:27.349 --> 03:04:27.359 align:start position:0%
language is dangerously vague and
 
03:04:29.750 --> 03:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
dangerously broad I'm really worried
 
03:04:32.090 --> 03:04:32.100 align:start position:0%
that this bill can have cruel and
 
03:04:34.550 --> 03:04:34.560 align:start position:0%
potentially dangerous consequences
 
03:04:37.070 --> 03:04:37.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not taking any questions today but I
 
03:04:39.170 --> 03:04:39.180 align:start position:0%
would ask you to vote itl on House Bill
 
03:04:41.570 --> 03:04:41.580 align:start position:0%
346. thank you thank you very much
 
03:04:43.610 --> 03:04:43.620 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to testify on House
 
03:04:46.010 --> 03:04:46.020 align:start position:0%
Bill 346.
 
03:04:48.050 --> 03:04:48.060 align:start position:0%
see none I'm going to close the hearing
 
03:04:50.330 --> 03:04:50.340 align:start position:0%
I know we're about an hour and a half
 
03:04:54.230 --> 03:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
over uh over time but uh I'm gonna move
 
03:04:57.849 --> 03:04:57.859 align:start position:0%
on and open the hearing on House Bill
 
03:04:57.859 --> 03:04:59.389 align:start position:0%
on and open the hearing on House Bill
562.

03:04:59.389 --> 03:04:59.399 align:start position:0%
562.
 
03:05:01.969 --> 03:05:01.979 align:start position:0%
requiring informed consent prior to
 
03:05:05.150 --> 03:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
receiving an abortion procedure and
 
03:05:07.010 --> 03:05:07.020 align:start position:0%
given that it's
 
03:05:10.130 --> 03:05:10.140 align:start position:0%
sort of the lunch hour if there are
 
03:05:13.250 --> 03:05:13.260 align:start position:0%
people uh on the committee that wish to
 
03:05:16.670 --> 03:05:16.680 align:start position:0%
uh wish to uh be excused for a short
 
03:05:18.710 --> 03:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
time to take lunch that's fine
 
03:05:20.750 --> 03:05:20.760 align:start position:0%
um I'll uh there'll be some of us
 
03:05:22.370 --> 03:05:22.380 align:start position:0%
that'll hang in here for a while and
 
03:05:24.349 --> 03:05:24.359 align:start position:0%
maybe do it in shifts uh but it's some
 
03:05:27.110 --> 03:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
people wish to do that please uh
 
03:05:29.210 --> 03:05:29.220 align:start position:0%
please feel free to do that so I'm going
 
03:05:32.690 --> 03:05:32.700 align:start position:0%
to first uh recognize uh representative
 
03:05:35.210 --> 03:05:35.220 align:start position:0%
testerman uh the prime sponsor of the
 
03:05:38.750 --> 03:05:38.760 align:start position:0%
bill thank you uh
 
03:05:41.929 --> 03:05:41.939 align:start position:0%
my name is Dave testerman I'm a a rep
 
03:05:46.849 --> 03:05:46.859 align:start position:0%
from Franklin uh I'm a father of four
 
03:05:51.050 --> 03:05:51.060 align:start position:0%
a I have 11 grandchildren actually 12.
 
03:05:54.290 --> 03:05:54.300 align:start position:0%
uh and yeah
 
03:05:58.269 --> 03:05:58.279 align:start position:0%
I've never been through this kind of of
 
03:06:02.690 --> 03:06:02.700 align:start position:0%
operation of an abortion before
 
03:06:05.330 --> 03:06:05.340 align:start position:0%
the easy thing about this particular one
 
03:06:09.170 --> 03:06:09.180 align:start position:0%
is it's not asking you to provide some
 
03:06:11.570 --> 03:06:11.580 align:start position:0%
sort of service to a person who is going
 
03:06:14.990 --> 03:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
to have an abortion it's not asking you
 
03:06:19.010 --> 03:06:19.020 align:start position:0%
to to talk about like in the last build
 
03:06:22.429 --> 03:06:22.439 align:start position:0%
some of the issues about what happens
 
03:06:25.849 --> 03:06:25.859 align:start position:0%
you know during an abortion all I'm
 
03:06:28.790 --> 03:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
asking for is to provide a piece of
 
03:06:32.690 --> 03:06:32.700 align:start position:0%
information to a to a person who is
 
03:06:34.969 --> 03:06:34.979 align:start position:0%
going to have an abortion it's a
 
03:06:38.650 --> 03:06:38.660 align:start position:0%
relatively long detailed kind of uh
 
03:06:42.290 --> 03:06:42.300 align:start position:0%
information uh and it's the sort of
 
03:06:44.210 --> 03:06:44.220 align:start position:0%
thing you would expect to hear
 
03:06:47.210 --> 03:06:47.220 align:start position:0%
I mean what you would hear from a a I'm
 
03:06:48.830 --> 03:06:48.840 align:start position:0%
going to have
 
03:06:51.290 --> 03:06:51.300 align:start position:0%
whatever operation
 
03:06:55.130 --> 03:06:55.140 align:start position:0%
in a long a bit of information that they
 
03:06:57.650 --> 03:06:57.660 align:start position:0%
would give you over that period of time
 
03:06:59.510 --> 03:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
and that's all
 
03:07:02.630 --> 03:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
uh even though I mean I'm an engineer
 
03:07:04.550 --> 03:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
I can't tell you what all this
 
03:07:07.250 --> 03:07:07.260 align:start position:0%
information is it makes sense I can't
 
03:07:08.690 --> 03:07:08.700 align:start position:0%
tell you what it is so like I'm not
 
03:07:11.590 --> 03:07:11.600 align:start position:0%
going to answer those kind of questions
 
03:07:15.110 --> 03:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
what I'm here to answer is should we
 
03:07:17.570 --> 03:07:17.580 align:start position:0%
give a person who is going to have an
 
03:07:17.580 --> 03:07:18.710 align:start position:0%
give a person who is going to have an
abortion

03:07:18.710 --> 03:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
abortion
 
03:07:20.389 --> 03:07:20.399 align:start position:0%
a full
 
03:07:26.570 --> 03:07:26.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:31.610 --> 03:07:31.620 align:start position:0%
for a full and complete group of data to
 
03:07:33.650 --> 03:07:33.660 align:start position:0%
make a decision that you're going to
 
03:07:36.170 --> 03:07:36.180 align:start position:0%
have to make either shortly or in the
 
03:07:37.370 --> 03:07:37.380 align:start position:0%
near future
 
03:07:40.510 --> 03:07:40.520 align:start position:0%
so with that uh
 
03:07:44.389 --> 03:07:44.399 align:start position:0%
I'm open to any questions but again I
 
03:07:46.550 --> 03:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
can't tell you whether or not a
 
03:07:49.429 --> 03:07:49.439 align:start position:0%
particular kind of information that was
 
03:07:53.030 --> 03:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
being prevented presented here is is you
 
03:07:55.790 --> 03:07:55.800 align:start position:0%
know right wrong it's what the experts
 
03:07:58.610 --> 03:07:58.620 align:start position:0%
say is right uh
 
03:07:59.690 --> 03:07:59.700 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:08:04.550 --> 03:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:06.290 --> 03:08:06.300 align:start position:0%
I guess I do have a question
 
03:08:08.750 --> 03:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
representative I'm wondering um
 
03:08:11.150 --> 03:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
as I look through the bill
 
03:08:11.160 --> 03:08:13.070 align:start position:0%
as I look through the bill
um

03:08:13.070 --> 03:08:13.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:08:16.730 --> 03:08:16.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:19.910 --> 03:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
my basic question is is do we
 
03:08:22.849 --> 03:08:22.859 align:start position:0%
do you have some
 
03:08:26.530 --> 03:08:26.540 align:start position:0%
evidence or some you know some some
 
03:08:29.090 --> 03:08:29.100 align:start position:0%
documentation or some evidence that you
 
03:08:31.849 --> 03:08:31.859 align:start position:0%
can point to suggesting that
 
03:08:35.269 --> 03:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
there's a real problem with
 
03:08:37.429 --> 03:08:37.439 align:start position:0%
you know a substantial number of women
 
03:08:40.269 --> 03:08:40.279 align:start position:0%
who are having abortions not
 
03:08:43.130 --> 03:08:43.140 align:start position:0%
not giving consent that they're that you
 
03:08:46.849 --> 03:08:46.859 align:start position:0%
know we we need to be concerned that a
 
03:08:49.150 --> 03:08:49.160 align:start position:0%
lot of women are are sort of being
 
03:08:51.590 --> 03:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
forced to have an abortion against their
 
03:08:53.269 --> 03:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
against their will
 
03:08:55.790 --> 03:08:55.800 align:start position:0%
no my my understanding isn't that
 
03:08:59.150 --> 03:08:59.160 align:start position:0%
they're being forced to give in a uh
 
03:09:01.250 --> 03:09:01.260 align:start position:0%
an opinion about whether or not they
 
03:09:02.870 --> 03:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
want to have an abortion against their
 
03:09:02.880 --> 03:09:03.910 align:start position:0%
want to have an abortion against their
will

03:09:03.910 --> 03:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
will
 
03:09:06.769 --> 03:09:06.779 align:start position:0%
my question is and the reason we've got
 
03:09:10.370 --> 03:09:10.380 align:start position:0%
this is strictly are the people there
 
03:09:10.380 --> 03:09:13.370 align:start position:0%
this is strictly are the people there
will

03:09:13.370 --> 03:09:13.380 align:start position:0%
will
 
03:09:13.380 --> 03:09:14.830 align:start position:0%
will
properly

03:09:14.830 --> 03:09:14.840 align:start position:0%
properly
 
03:09:17.090 --> 03:09:17.100 align:start position:0%
informed as to what they're they're
 
03:09:19.130 --> 03:09:19.140 align:start position:0%
talking about in a way of an abortion
 
03:09:22.070 --> 03:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
whether it's an abortion on drugs a
 
03:09:25.130 --> 03:09:25.140 align:start position:0%
physical abortion uh and just you know
 
03:09:27.769 --> 03:09:27.779 align:start position:0%
do you have that do you have the
 
03:09:30.590 --> 03:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
information that is necessary
 
03:09:32.650 --> 03:09:32.660 align:start position:0%
have you seen this information before
 
03:09:36.830 --> 03:09:36.840 align:start position:0%
but I I'm not uh I'm not I I have no
 
03:09:39.170 --> 03:09:39.180 align:start position:0%
indication that there may be a problem
 
03:09:41.870 --> 03:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
without it thank you other questions for
 
03:09:44.030 --> 03:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
this Witness oh
 
03:09:47.330 --> 03:09:47.340 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you representative
 
03:09:50.210 --> 03:09:50.220 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding and correct me if
 
03:09:53.210 --> 03:09:53.220 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong with this bill is clarifying
 
03:09:56.690 --> 03:09:56.700 align:start position:0%
when you're having surgery for example
 
03:09:59.030 --> 03:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
you have to listen to the pros and cons
 
03:10:01.550 --> 03:10:01.560 align:start position:0%
they won't just you can't just say I
 
03:10:02.750 --> 03:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
don't want to hear that
 
03:10:04.790 --> 03:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding when you're having
 
03:10:07.070 --> 03:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
an abortion and if someone's here from
 
03:10:08.929 --> 03:10:08.939 align:start position:0%
Planned Parenthood they could correct me
 
03:10:11.210 --> 03:10:11.220 align:start position:0%
but it's my understanding that you're
 
03:10:13.429 --> 03:10:13.439 align:start position:0%
allowed to say I don't want to know
 
03:10:13.439 --> 03:10:14.510 align:start position:0%
allowed to say I don't want to know
it's

03:10:14.510 --> 03:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:10:17.450 --> 03:10:17.460 align:start position:0%
I believe what I'm understanding from
 
03:10:20.450 --> 03:10:20.460 align:start position:0%
this bill is that
 
03:10:24.769 --> 03:10:24.779 align:start position:0%
it is requiring you to have that
 
03:10:24.779 --> 03:10:25.750 align:start position:0%
it is requiring you to have that
information

03:10:25.750 --> 03:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
information
 
03:10:30.650 --> 03:10:30.660 align:start position:0%
much like as if you were having a major
 
03:10:32.690 --> 03:10:32.700 align:start position:0%
medical procedure
 
03:10:34.429 --> 03:10:34.439 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
03:10:36.889 --> 03:10:36.899 align:start position:0%
I understand that's correct
 
03:10:41.150 --> 03:10:41.160 align:start position:0%
right other questions for this workers
 
03:10:44.389 --> 03:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:47.929 --> 03:10:47.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:47.939 --> 03:10:50.330 align:start position:0%
 
consent

03:10:50.330 --> 03:10:50.340 align:start position:0%
consent
 
03:10:50.340 --> 03:10:51.710 align:start position:0%
consent
but

03:10:51.710 --> 03:10:51.720 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:10:55.190 --> 03:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I just didn't hear you
 
03:10:58.190 --> 03:10:58.200 align:start position:0%
should we be dictating informed consent
 
03:10:58.200 --> 03:11:04.969 align:start position:0%
should we be dictating informed consent
content

03:11:04.969 --> 03:11:04.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:08.150 --> 03:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
in effect it is informed consent
 
03:11:10.849 --> 03:11:10.859 align:start position:0%
so I I don't know whether it's proper to
 
03:11:15.290 --> 03:11:15.300 align:start position:0%
end to to tell somebody you know that
 
03:11:17.090 --> 03:11:17.100 align:start position:0%
they have to listen to this
 
03:11:19.730 --> 03:11:19.740 align:start position:0%
but I believe they should
 
03:11:23.330 --> 03:11:23.340 align:start position:0%
other questions for this wedding
 
03:11:24.530 --> 03:11:24.540 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
03:11:26.389 --> 03:11:26.399 align:start position:0%
representative thank you
 
03:11:29.389 --> 03:11:29.399 align:start position:0%
uh representative uh
 
03:11:31.309 --> 03:11:31.319 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative sellers yes
 
03:11:38.750 --> 03:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:41.090 --> 03:11:41.100 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you chair and thank
 
03:11:43.130 --> 03:11:43.140 align:start position:0%
you committee members actually I'm
 
03:11:44.269 --> 03:11:44.279 align:start position:0%
starting to feel like I'm on the
 
03:11:46.910 --> 03:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee I've been here for
 
03:11:50.090 --> 03:11:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:51.950 --> 03:11:51.960 align:start position:0%
I I read through this bill and I was
 
03:11:53.809 --> 03:11:53.819 align:start position:0%
looking at it and yes I am a co-signer
 
03:11:55.490 --> 03:11:55.500 align:start position:0%
of the bill as well
 
03:11:58.610 --> 03:11:58.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:01.370 --> 03:12:01.380 align:start position:0%
what's wrong with consent I mean just
 
03:12:02.990 --> 03:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
you know what we're trying to do is
 
03:12:04.730 --> 03:12:04.740 align:start position:0%
making sure the
 
03:12:04.740 --> 03:12:06.230 align:start position:0%
making sure the
person

03:12:06.230 --> 03:12:06.240 align:start position:0%
person
 
03:12:08.510 --> 03:12:08.520 align:start position:0%
going for the abortion
 
03:12:11.630 --> 03:12:11.640 align:start position:0%
has comprehensive knowledge
 
03:12:13.969 --> 03:12:13.979 align:start position:0%
of exactly where they are and what stage
 
03:12:16.370 --> 03:12:16.380 align:start position:0%
they're in and knowing exactly what
 
03:12:18.110 --> 03:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
they're going to be
 
03:12:20.750 --> 03:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
what's going to actually happen to them
 
03:12:24.650 --> 03:12:24.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:28.849 --> 03:12:28.859 align:start position:0%
so it's consent it also don't say do you
 
03:12:31.730 --> 03:12:31.740 align:start position:0%
know and and there's making sure the
 
03:12:33.769 --> 03:12:33.779 align:start position:0%
doctors are going step one two three
 
03:12:35.750 --> 03:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
four five and six that's all they're
 
03:12:37.250 --> 03:12:37.260 align:start position:0%
doing they're asking for it
 
03:12:40.010 --> 03:12:40.020 align:start position:0%
so I I don't really see any problem with
 
03:12:41.510 --> 03:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
a bill like this
 
03:12:43.849 --> 03:12:43.859 align:start position:0%
it's consent I think it's comprehensive
 
03:12:46.790 --> 03:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
and make it sure it's inclusive again if
 
03:12:48.530 --> 03:12:48.540 align:start position:0%
we if we pass a bill and they say well
 
03:12:50.570 --> 03:12:50.580 align:start position:0%
you know we missed this or we should add
 
03:12:52.610 --> 03:12:52.620 align:start position:0%
that well that's what we had amendments
 
03:12:54.230 --> 03:12:54.240 align:start position:0%
for so
 
03:12:56.030 --> 03:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
03:12:57.530 --> 03:12:57.540 align:start position:0%
questions for this one yes
 
03:12:57.540 --> 03:12:59.570 align:start position:0%
questions for this one yes
representative

03:12:59.570 --> 03:12:59.580 align:start position:0%

Advanced informed consent
 
03:13:10.670 --> 03:13:10.680 align:start position:0%
a blood procedure
 
03:13:12.349 --> 03:13:12.359 align:start position:0%
are you aware of any other medical
 
03:13:14.769 --> 03:13:14.779 align:start position:0%
procedure that requires 24 hours
 
03:13:18.230 --> 03:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
Advanced informed consent no I'm not
 
03:13:20.389 --> 03:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:13:23.090 --> 03:13:23.100 align:start position:0%
other questions for this Witness
 
03:13:25.130 --> 03:13:25.140 align:start position:0%
yes representative Greece
 
03:13:26.389 --> 03:13:26.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:13:27.769 --> 03:13:27.779 align:start position:0%
representative are you aware of any
 
03:13:30.889 --> 03:13:30.899 align:start position:0%
medical procedures that do not require
 
03:13:36.349 --> 03:13:36.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:39.230 --> 03:13:39.240 align:start position:0%
other questions for this Witness
 
03:13:41.210 --> 03:13:41.220 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh representative
 
03:13:44.150 --> 03:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
one other sir what oh I'm sorry was
 
03:13:45.650 --> 03:13:45.660 align:start position:0%
there another question here oh yes
 
03:13:49.190 --> 03:13:49.200 align:start position:0%
representative very often now when
 
03:13:52.790 --> 03:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
people go in for pre-operative
 
03:13:56.450 --> 03:13:56.460 align:start position:0%
um evaluations prior to major surgeries
 
03:14:00.650 --> 03:14:00.660 align:start position:0%
it is that time or at least it was that
 
03:14:03.710 --> 03:14:03.720 align:start position:0%
time when they sign read and sign their
 
03:14:06.830 --> 03:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
form percent consent which is done
 
03:14:10.490 --> 03:14:10.500 align:start position:0%
usually prior unless an emergency basis
 
03:14:14.330 --> 03:14:14.340 align:start position:0%
to 24 hours before the procedure
 
03:14:16.730 --> 03:14:16.740 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding if it's changed
 
03:14:18.590 --> 03:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
I apologize
 
03:14:20.870 --> 03:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
so is that a statement or a question I
 
03:14:23.870 --> 03:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
guess thank you so so I guess maybe I
 
03:14:25.490 --> 03:14:25.500 align:start position:0%
have a question just to sort of follow
 
03:14:28.490 --> 03:14:28.500 align:start position:0%
up on representative's question
 
03:14:28.500 --> 03:14:29.990 align:start position:0%
up on representative's question
um

03:14:29.990 --> 03:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:32.990 --> 03:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
this would propose I I have no doubt
 
03:14:35.990 --> 03:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
that you know in when surgical
 
03:14:37.610 --> 03:14:37.620 align:start position:0%
procedures of one kind or medical
 
03:14:39.290 --> 03:14:39.300 align:start position:0%
procedures of one kind or another are
 
03:14:42.050 --> 03:14:42.060 align:start position:0%
undertaken the medical people require
 
03:14:46.429 --> 03:14:46.439 align:start position:0%
consent this would put consent for this
 
03:14:49.010 --> 03:14:49.020 align:start position:0%
particular type of procedure in statute
 
03:14:51.290 --> 03:14:51.300 align:start position:0%
and I guess what I'm wondering is
 
03:14:53.929 --> 03:14:53.939 align:start position:0%
let's take something that's completely
 
03:14:56.570 --> 03:14:56.580 align:start position:0%
sort of what I would characterize as
 
03:14:56.580 --> 03:14:57.769 align:start position:0%
sort of what I would characterize as
voluntary

03:14:57.769 --> 03:14:57.779 align:start position:0%
voluntary
 
03:15:00.590 --> 03:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
the cosmetic surgery
 
03:15:03.650 --> 03:15:03.660 align:start position:0%
do you know which is it strikes me as
 
03:15:05.929 --> 03:15:05.939 align:start position:0%
the the risk of having that or not
 
03:15:08.570 --> 03:15:08.580 align:start position:0%
having that is in terms of what you what
 
03:15:13.610 --> 03:15:13.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:15.830 --> 03:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
important if you will then at least in
 
03:15:19.070 --> 03:15:19.080 align:start position:0%
most cases than than the risks on one
 
03:15:22.730 --> 03:15:22.740 align:start position:0%
side or another of abortion uh do we
 
03:15:25.490 --> 03:15:25.500 align:start position:0%
have a statute that says before you can
 
03:15:27.950 --> 03:15:27.960 align:start position:0%
perform cosmetic surgery the doctor has
 
03:15:30.889 --> 03:15:30.899 align:start position:0%
to get consent
 
03:15:33.230 --> 03:15:33.240 align:start position:0%
um in the way that this bill talks about
 
03:15:33.240 --> 03:15:35.030 align:start position:0%
um in the way that this bill talks about
consent

03:15:35.030 --> 03:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
consent
 
03:15:38.750 --> 03:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
if uh representative I'm not sure if we
 
03:15:40.490 --> 03:15:40.500 align:start position:0%
have a statue on that I have not looked
 
03:15:43.010 --> 03:15:43.020 align:start position:0%
up any other statues on consent
 
03:15:45.590 --> 03:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
however this consent is very specific
 
03:15:47.809 --> 03:15:47.819 align:start position:0%
for abortions that's my understanding
 
03:15:49.610 --> 03:15:49.620 align:start position:0%
and it's very comprehensive to make sure
 
03:15:52.490 --> 03:15:52.500 align:start position:0%
the woman that's getting the abortion is
 
03:15:54.469 --> 03:15:54.479 align:start position:0%
very clear where she's at and what's
 
03:15:55.969 --> 03:15:55.979 align:start position:0%
going on and what's going to happen in
 
03:15:58.309 --> 03:15:58.319 align:start position:0%
her abortion
 
03:16:01.550 --> 03:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
all right other questions for this week
 
03:16:04.429 --> 03:16:04.439 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
03:16:06.590 --> 03:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you Mr chair
 
03:16:09.110 --> 03:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh
 
03:16:10.670 --> 03:16:10.680 align:start position:0%
somebody else may have already asked
 
03:16:11.690 --> 03:16:11.700 align:start position:0%
this question
 
03:16:15.290 --> 03:16:15.300 align:start position:0%
but I may have been distracted so uh my
 
03:16:16.429 --> 03:16:16.439 align:start position:0%
question is
 
03:16:20.150 --> 03:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
uh is it necessary already
 
03:16:23.690 --> 03:16:23.700 align:start position:0%
for a person having a uh an abortion to
 
03:16:23.700 --> 03:16:24.530 align:start position:0%
for a person having a uh an abortion to
give

03:16:24.530 --> 03:16:24.540 align:start position:0%
give
 
03:16:24.540 --> 03:16:26.990 align:start position:0%
give
uh

03:16:26.990 --> 03:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:16:27.000 --> 03:16:28.790 align:start position:0%
uh
consent

03:16:28.790 --> 03:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
consent
 
03:16:30.530 --> 03:16:30.540 align:start position:0%
informed consent
 
03:16:32.630 --> 03:16:32.640 align:start position:0%
I didn't hear the last part is it
 
03:16:35.630 --> 03:16:35.640 align:start position:0%
necessary already for a person getting
 
03:16:37.849 --> 03:16:37.859 align:start position:0%
an abortion that to give informed
 
03:16:39.710 --> 03:16:39.720 align:start position:0%
consent well that's a good question
 
03:16:41.150 --> 03:16:41.160 align:start position:0%
because you know one of the things that
 
03:16:42.769 --> 03:16:42.779 align:start position:0%
we don't do here and again is brought up
 
03:16:44.750 --> 03:16:44.760 align:start position:0%
a couple times today is that we don't
 
03:16:46.490 --> 03:16:46.500 align:start position:0%
track abortions we don't count them we
 
03:16:48.650 --> 03:16:48.660 align:start position:0%
don't know how many and I don't work for
 
03:16:50.210 --> 03:16:50.220 align:start position:0%
Planned Parenthood or a couple other
 
03:16:51.590 --> 03:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
outlets that might actually perform
 
03:16:54.349 --> 03:16:54.359 align:start position:0%
abortions so I don't really know what
 
03:16:55.790 --> 03:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
they have and what they give out for
 
03:16:55.800 --> 03:16:58.610 align:start position:0%
they have and what they give out for
documentation

03:16:58.610 --> 03:16:58.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:01.250 --> 03:17:01.260 align:start position:0%
other question answer that
 
03:17:04.670 --> 03:17:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:07.130 --> 03:17:07.140 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative divine
 
03:17:08.870 --> 03:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
03:17:10.309 --> 03:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
my question
 
03:17:12.050 --> 03:17:12.060 align:start position:0%
um on page
 
03:17:16.450 --> 03:17:16.460 align:start position:0%
I guess three of the proposed Bill
 
03:17:20.410 --> 03:17:20.420 align:start position:0%
lines 18 through 21
 
03:17:22.370 --> 03:17:22.380 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
03:17:26.030 --> 03:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
get having an ultrasound and an
 
03:17:29.450 --> 03:17:29.460 align:start position:0%
ultrasound usually takes time to set up
 
03:17:31.370 --> 03:17:31.380 align:start position:0%
can it be
 
03:17:33.290 --> 03:17:33.300 align:start position:0%
um you know it could take a week or
 
03:17:35.330 --> 03:17:35.340 align:start position:0%
something like that before you get an
 
03:17:35.340 --> 03:17:36.950 align:start position:0%
something like that before you get an
actual

03:17:36.950 --> 03:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
actual
 
03:17:39.889 --> 03:17:39.899 align:start position:0%
um appointment for that ultrasound is
 
03:17:42.830 --> 03:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
this a mandatory part of this bill that
 
03:17:45.230 --> 03:17:45.240 align:start position:0%
that has is it a requirement of informed
 
03:17:47.269 --> 03:17:47.279 align:start position:0%
consent for the individual that is going
 
03:17:49.370 --> 03:17:49.380 align:start position:0%
for an abortion
 
03:17:52.010 --> 03:17:52.020 align:start position:0%
so my understanding from some testimony
 
03:17:53.929 --> 03:17:53.939 align:start position:0%
we heard yesterday is that ultrasounds
 
03:17:57.050 --> 03:17:57.060 align:start position:0%
are available right then and there you
 
03:17:59.389 --> 03:17:59.399 align:start position:0%
know at the clinic so just to verify
 
03:18:03.769 --> 03:18:03.779 align:start position:0%
that how all the infant is so
 
03:18:05.389 --> 03:18:05.399 align:start position:0%
I don't know if it would take a week or
 
03:18:08.450 --> 03:18:08.460 align:start position:0%
not it doesn't sound like if well I'm
 
03:18:12.050 --> 03:18:12.060 align:start position:0%
just wondering I'm wondering you know is
 
03:18:15.050 --> 03:18:15.060 align:start position:0%
is this a delay tactic for the abortion
 
03:18:16.910 --> 03:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
and written in the bill and that's what
 
03:18:18.769 --> 03:18:18.779 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering I understand what you're
 
03:18:20.750 --> 03:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
saying though and I don't have an answer
 
03:18:24.050 --> 03:18:24.060 align:start position:0%
to that and I hope that's not the case
 
03:18:27.530 --> 03:18:27.540 align:start position:0%
thank you yes representative Morgan
 
03:18:29.150 --> 03:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much thank you very
 
03:18:31.130 --> 03:18:31.140 align:start position:0%
much representative and you may or may
 
03:18:31.140 --> 03:18:31.969 align:start position:0%
much representative and you may or may
not

03:18:31.969 --> 03:18:31.979 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:18:34.490 --> 03:18:34.500 align:start position:0%
be able to answer this but um there's a
 
03:18:36.410 --> 03:18:36.420 align:start position:0%
lot of very very detailed wording in
 
03:18:36.420 --> 03:18:37.309 align:start position:0%
lot of very very detailed wording in
this

03:18:37.309 --> 03:18:37.319 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:18:39.889 --> 03:18:39.899 align:start position:0%
build which is fine and a lot of it
 
03:18:41.870 --> 03:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
turns up an identical or nearly
 
03:18:44.630 --> 03:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
identical form in other states bills
 
03:18:46.250 --> 03:18:46.260 align:start position:0%
have been used in other states in some
 
03:18:48.469 --> 03:18:48.479 align:start position:0%
cases past so
 
03:18:48.479 --> 03:18:49.130 align:start position:0%
cases past so
um

03:18:49.130 --> 03:18:49.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:51.710 --> 03:18:51.720 align:start position:0%
some definitely it's a fair so the first
 
03:18:53.450 --> 03:18:53.460 align:start position:0%
question is it fair to inform that you
 
03:18:55.130 --> 03:18:55.140 align:start position:0%
and representative curteling or Peter
 
03:18:58.070 --> 03:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
didn't craft this all yourself and like
 
03:18:59.150 --> 03:18:59.160 align:start position:0%
do you
 
03:19:01.070 --> 03:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
are you prepared to tell us what the
 
03:19:03.530 --> 03:19:03.540 align:start position:0%
source of the model legislation was
 
03:19:07.010 --> 03:19:07.020 align:start position:0%
are you asking me about model uh this
 
03:19:08.570 --> 03:19:08.580 align:start position:0%
appears to be model legislation that's
 
03:19:10.490 --> 03:19:10.500 align:start position:0%
been passed in other states so like who
 
03:19:14.150 --> 03:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
I who I cannot answer that right thank
 
03:19:15.530 --> 03:19:15.540 align:start position:0%
you all right other questions for this
 
03:19:15.540 --> 03:19:17.750 align:start position:0%
you all right other questions for this
Witness

03:19:17.750 --> 03:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:20.450 --> 03:19:20.460 align:start position:0%
see none thank you uh thank you thank
 
03:19:22.670 --> 03:19:22.680 align:start position:0%
you committee thank you I call in former
 
03:19:25.370 --> 03:19:25.380 align:start position:0%
representative uh Phyllis Woods followed
 
03:19:29.349 --> 03:19:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:31.550 --> 03:19:31.560 align:start position:0%
representative Woods
 
03:19:34.550 --> 03:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
don't think she's here all right uh
 
03:19:42.410 --> 03:19:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:44.269 --> 03:19:44.279 align:start position:0%
good afternoon again
 
03:19:45.889 --> 03:19:45.899 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and members of the committee
 
03:19:47.269 --> 03:19:47.279 align:start position:0%
my name is Danielle Pimentel with
 
03:19:50.469 --> 03:19:50.479 align:start position:0%
Americans United for life and
 
03:19:53.330 --> 03:19:53.340 align:start position:0%
hb562 safeguards women's informed
 
03:19:54.769 --> 03:19:54.779 align:start position:0%
consent and ensures that women
 
03:19:56.990 --> 03:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
understand the real alternative to
 
03:19:58.309 --> 03:19:58.319 align:start position:0%
abortion which is why I urge your
 
03:20:00.230 --> 03:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
support I want to first start out though
 
03:20:01.849 --> 03:20:01.859 align:start position:0%
and address some of the questions that
 
03:20:03.650 --> 03:20:03.660 align:start position:0%
you all had raised just um during the
 
03:20:05.450 --> 03:20:05.460 align:start position:0%
previous testimony
 
03:20:07.670 --> 03:20:07.680 align:start position:0%
um representative Lanza you had a
 
03:20:08.929 --> 03:20:08.939 align:start position:0%
question about whether we should dictate
 
03:20:10.550 --> 03:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
informed consent
 
03:20:12.349 --> 03:20:12.359 align:start position:0%
and so I just wanted to address that in
 
03:20:15.050 --> 03:20:15.060 align:start position:0%
in Dobbs the Supreme Court overruled Roe
 
03:20:16.849 --> 03:20:16.859 align:start position:0%
Wade and Casey or Planned Parenthood
 
03:20:19.070 --> 03:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
versus Casey and the Court held that
 
03:20:21.290 --> 03:20:21.300 align:start position:0%
states May regulate abortion for
 
03:20:23.269 --> 03:20:23.279 align:start position:0%
legitimate reasons and that a law
 
03:20:25.130 --> 03:20:25.140 align:start position:0%
regulating abortion
 
03:20:27.110 --> 03:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
um is entitled to a strong presumption
 
03:20:29.570 --> 03:20:29.580 align:start position:0%
of validity so in this regard New
 
03:20:31.030 --> 03:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has
 
03:20:34.929 --> 03:20:34.939 align:start position:0%
broad powers to pass informed consent
 
03:20:37.429 --> 03:20:37.439 align:start position:0%
protections which ensure that a woman's
 
03:20:39.950 --> 03:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
decision to abort her child
 
03:20:42.730 --> 03:20:42.740 align:start position:0%
um unborn child is informed involuntary
 
03:20:45.050 --> 03:20:45.060 align:start position:0%
also to address
 
03:20:47.450 --> 03:20:47.460 align:start position:0%
um Mr chairman your question about do we
 
03:20:49.429 --> 03:20:49.439 align:start position:0%
have any data or statistics with course
 
03:20:52.370 --> 03:20:52.380 align:start position:0%
abortions or people the need for
 
03:20:55.130 --> 03:20:55.140 align:start position:0%
informed consent in that regard and I
 
03:20:56.809 --> 03:20:56.819 align:start position:0%
spoke to this a little bit yesterday and
 
03:20:58.190 --> 03:20:58.200 align:start position:0%
I'm going to turn to some of my
 
03:20:59.809 --> 03:20:59.819 align:start position:0%
testimony I submitted written testimony
 
03:21:01.910 --> 03:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
on all these bills but
 
03:21:01.920 --> 03:21:02.630 align:start position:0%
on all these bills but
um

03:21:02.630 --> 03:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:05.870 --> 03:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
women seeking abortion are often are
 
03:21:07.250 --> 03:21:07.260 align:start position:0%
there are high rates of women seeking
 
03:21:08.570 --> 03:21:08.580 align:start position:0%
abortion that are subject to intimate
 
03:21:10.370 --> 03:21:10.380 align:start position:0%
partner violence and or reproductive
 
03:21:13.550 --> 03:21:13.560 align:start position:0%
control and so let me just turn to that
 
03:21:15.290 --> 03:21:15.300 align:start position:0%
so I can reference some of these sources
 
03:21:15.300 --> 03:21:17.030 align:start position:0%
so I can reference some of these sources
here

03:21:17.030 --> 03:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:21:18.290 --> 03:21:18.300 align:start position:0%
you just
 
03:21:22.969 --> 03:21:22.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:24.469 --> 03:21:24.479 align:start position:0%
um an intimate partner violence that
 
03:21:26.870 --> 03:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
could be anything from you know sexual
 
03:21:28.910 --> 03:21:28.920 align:start position:0%
emotional physical abuse anything like
 
03:21:30.950 --> 03:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
that and for women seeking an abortion
 
03:21:32.929 --> 03:21:32.939 align:start position:0%
the prevalence of ipv which is the
 
03:21:34.550 --> 03:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
acronym for that is nearly three times
 
03:21:36.410 --> 03:21:36.420 align:start position:0%
greater than women continuing a
 
03:21:38.450 --> 03:21:38.460 align:start position:0%
pregnancy and for Reproductive control
 
03:21:40.730 --> 03:21:40.740 align:start position:0%
which is when a partner or family member
 
03:21:43.730 --> 03:21:43.740 align:start position:0%
or could be a sex trafficker tries to
 
03:21:45.530 --> 03:21:45.540 align:start position:0%
assert control of a woman's reproductive
 
03:21:45.540 --> 03:21:46.849 align:start position:0%
assert control of a woman's reproductive
Choice

03:21:46.849 --> 03:21:46.859 align:start position:0%
Choice
 
03:21:49.969 --> 03:21:49.979 align:start position:0%
um one in four I think a quarter I mean
 
03:21:51.290 --> 03:21:51.300 align:start position:0%
as many as a quarter woman of
 
03:21:53.269 --> 03:21:53.279 align:start position:0%
reproductive age attending for sexual
 
03:21:55.130 --> 03:21:55.140 align:start position:0%
and reproductive Health Services have
 
03:21:56.330 --> 03:21:56.340 align:start position:0%
given a history of suffering
 
03:21:58.610 --> 03:21:58.620 align:start position:0%
reproductive control so because of the
 
03:22:00.590 --> 03:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
prevalence of ipv and because the
 
03:22:01.969 --> 03:22:01.979 align:start position:0%
prevalence of reproductive control in
 
03:22:03.670 --> 03:22:03.680 align:start position:0%
women seeking abortions
 
03:22:06.290 --> 03:22:06.300 align:start position:0%
informed consent safeguards can help
 
03:22:08.570 --> 03:22:08.580 align:start position:0%
ensure that women are having the
 
03:22:10.969 --> 03:22:10.979 align:start position:0%
information to voluntarily make these
 
03:22:12.769 --> 03:22:12.779 align:start position:0%
decisions for themselves to have an
 
03:22:15.230 --> 03:22:15.240 align:start position:0%
abortion or to not have an abortion and
 
03:22:17.690 --> 03:22:17.700 align:start position:0%
not be influenced by intimate partner
 
03:22:19.790 --> 03:22:19.800 align:start position:0%
violence or reproductive control so I'm
 
03:22:23.030 --> 03:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
just I guess I'm curious how is this how
 
03:22:24.410 --> 03:22:24.420 align:start position:0%
is this going to help that in other
 
03:22:26.090 --> 03:22:26.100 align:start position:0%
words a woman
 
03:22:29.570 --> 03:22:29.580 align:start position:0%
you know under your scenario a woman is
 
03:22:30.530 --> 03:22:30.540 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
03:22:34.550 --> 03:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
threatened or forced by her partner to
 
03:22:36.710 --> 03:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
get an abortion
 
03:22:38.210 --> 03:22:38.220 align:start position:0%
um and
 
03:22:40.610 --> 03:22:40.620 align:start position:0%
so she goes and we have let's assume
 
03:22:42.590 --> 03:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
this law is in effect
 
03:22:43.969 --> 03:22:43.979 align:start position:0%
um so the
 
03:22:47.510 --> 03:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
the how is that you know she's told you
 
03:22:49.910 --> 03:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
better agree to this abortion so she
 
03:22:52.070 --> 03:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
goes in by her intimate partner whatever
 
03:22:56.210 --> 03:22:56.220 align:start position:0%
and this this bill is in effect is this
 
03:22:58.910 --> 03:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
is she now going to just because because
 
03:23:01.250 --> 03:23:01.260 align:start position:0%
a doctor has read off these things to
 
03:23:03.110 --> 03:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
her she's going to say oh well I don't
 
03:23:04.610 --> 03:23:04.620 align:start position:0%
have to worry about my boyfriend beating
 
03:23:06.230 --> 03:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
the hell out of me if I don't get the
 
03:23:08.210 --> 03:23:08.220 align:start position:0%
abortion because I'm signing all these
 
03:23:09.650 --> 03:23:09.660 align:start position:0%
things isn't she just going to sign them
 
03:23:09.660 --> 03:23:10.370 align:start position:0%
things isn't she just going to sign them
anyway

03:23:10.370 --> 03:23:10.380 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
03:23:13.250 --> 03:23:13.260 align:start position:0%
well in this film particularly it offers
 
03:23:16.370 --> 03:23:16.380 align:start position:0%
or part of the bill requires that um the
 
03:23:19.130 --> 03:23:19.140 align:start position:0%
woman be informed of benefits to her so
 
03:23:21.050 --> 03:23:21.060 align:start position:0%
that could be benefits while she's
 
03:23:23.290 --> 03:23:23.300 align:start position:0%
pregnant that the state offers or
 
03:23:26.210 --> 03:23:26.220 align:start position:0%
prenatal care are part of postnatal care
 
03:23:27.950 --> 03:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
things like that and so when women are
 
03:23:27.960 --> 03:23:29.090 align:start position:0%
things like that and so when women are
have

03:23:29.090 --> 03:23:29.100 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:23:31.550 --> 03:23:31.560 align:start position:0%
um more information about the other
 
03:23:32.870 --> 03:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
Alternatives that they have the actual
 
03:23:34.429 --> 03:23:34.439 align:start position:0%
resources they have to help them that
 
03:23:38.510 --> 03:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
support social and familiar support from
 
03:23:40.130 --> 03:23:40.140 align:start position:0%
just Community around them and other
 
03:23:41.269 --> 03:23:41.279 align:start position:0%
Alternatives like from Pregnancy
 
03:23:44.210 --> 03:23:44.220 align:start position:0%
Resource Centers things like that they
 
03:23:46.250 --> 03:23:46.260 align:start position:0%
have a better I mean they may have if
 
03:23:47.269 --> 03:23:47.279 align:start position:0%
they want to continue that pregnancy
 
03:23:49.070 --> 03:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
then they have the information to know
 
03:23:50.330 --> 03:23:50.340 align:start position:0%
they will be supported even if they
 
03:23:51.349 --> 03:23:51.359 align:start position:0%
don't have that support from their
 
03:23:52.849 --> 03:23:52.859 align:start position:0%
partner that they have the support
 
03:23:54.349 --> 03:23:54.359 align:start position:0%
whether that's from the state or other
 
03:23:55.610 --> 03:23:55.620 align:start position:0%
people in the community that can help
 
03:23:58.190 --> 03:23:58.200 align:start position:0%
them care for their child or have an
 
03:23:59.389 --> 03:23:59.399 align:start position:0%
option to give their child up for
 
03:24:01.070 --> 03:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
adoption so this informed consent
 
03:24:03.110 --> 03:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
process would allow women to understand
 
03:24:05.269 --> 03:24:05.279 align:start position:0%
the resources available to them and
 
03:24:06.889 --> 03:24:06.899 align:start position:0%
therefore they're able to make decisions
 
03:24:06.899 --> 03:24:08.330 align:start position:0%
therefore they're able to make decisions
knowing

03:24:08.330 --> 03:24:08.340 align:start position:0%
knowing
 
03:24:10.370 --> 03:24:10.380 align:start position:0%
um that they have options for their baby
 
03:24:11.809 --> 03:24:11.819 align:start position:0%
if they want to give birth to their baby
 
03:24:14.269 --> 03:24:14.279 align:start position:0%
that maybe the baby would not be in the
 
03:24:15.469 --> 03:24:15.479 align:start position:0%
same situation that they're in with
 
03:24:18.469 --> 03:24:18.479 align:start position:0%
unfortunately a partner who is abusing
 
03:24:20.330 --> 03:24:20.340 align:start position:0%
them in some form all right all right
 
03:24:22.250 --> 03:24:22.260 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions for this
 
03:24:22.260 --> 03:24:23.870 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions for this
Witness

03:24:23.880 --> 03:24:29.990 align:start position:0%

correct

03:24:29.990 --> 03:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:32.090 --> 03:24:32.100 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry oh representative Andrews
 
03:24:35.090 --> 03:24:35.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:37.550 --> 03:24:37.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker and thank you for
 
03:24:39.590 --> 03:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:24:43.070 --> 03:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
okay before I have a surgical procedure
 
03:24:44.990 --> 03:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
please be out with me
 
03:24:49.010 --> 03:24:49.020 align:start position:0%
I have to sign the consent form
 
03:24:52.849 --> 03:24:52.859 align:start position:0%
is having an abortion a surgical
 
03:24:56.510 --> 03:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
procedure and why doesn't a consent poem
 
03:24:58.250 --> 03:24:58.260 align:start position:0%
have to be signed
 
03:25:01.550 --> 03:25:01.560 align:start position:0%
yes so it depends on the stage of
 
03:25:03.410 --> 03:25:03.420 align:start position:0%
pregnancy that woman or like the
 
03:25:04.849 --> 03:25:04.859 align:start position:0%
gestational age of the baby I should say
 
03:25:07.250 --> 03:25:07.260 align:start position:0%
so for the first 10 weeks
 
03:25:11.030 --> 03:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
um of a woman's pregnancy generally the
 
03:25:12.769 --> 03:25:12.779 align:start position:0%
abortion procedure would be a chemical
 
03:25:14.210 --> 03:25:14.220 align:start position:0%
abortion and so that's a two-pill
 
03:25:14.220 --> 03:25:15.650 align:start position:0%
abortion and so that's a two-pill
regimen

03:25:15.650 --> 03:25:15.660 align:start position:0%
regimen
 
03:25:20.030 --> 03:25:20.040 align:start position:0%
um however there could be some surgery
 
03:25:21.950 --> 03:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
um there could be surgery implied in
 
03:25:23.450 --> 03:25:23.460 align:start position:0%
that if the let's say the chemical
 
03:25:25.130 --> 03:25:25.140 align:start position:0%
abortion didn't fully work and there was
 
03:25:27.170 --> 03:25:27.180 align:start position:0%
a baby that needed to be expelled there
 
03:25:28.370 --> 03:25:28.380 align:start position:0%
could have to be actual surgical
 
03:25:28.380 --> 03:25:29.690 align:start position:0%
could have to be actual surgical
intervention

03:25:29.690 --> 03:25:29.700 align:start position:0%
intervention
 
03:25:31.550 --> 03:25:31.560 align:start position:0%
um after 10 weeks though it generally is
 
03:25:33.469 --> 03:25:33.479 align:start position:0%
a surgical procedure
 
03:25:35.510 --> 03:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
um either it's through kind of like a
 
03:25:37.370 --> 03:25:37.380 align:start position:0%
vacuum procedure I I don't know the full
 
03:25:39.110 --> 03:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
term of that or a DNE
 
03:25:40.190 --> 03:25:40.200 align:start position:0%
um something like that where there is
 
03:25:41.630 --> 03:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
actual surgery
 
03:25:43.550 --> 03:25:43.560 align:start position:0%
um or we classify that as a surgical
 
03:25:45.110 --> 03:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
procedure I should say
 
03:25:47.630 --> 03:25:47.640 align:start position:0%
um and so for those reasons and also
 
03:25:49.429 --> 03:25:49.439 align:start position:0%
with chemical abortions because of the
 
03:25:51.590 --> 03:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
risk that women face with chemical
 
03:25:51.600 --> 03:25:52.670 align:start position:0%
risk that women face with chemical
abortion

03:25:52.670 --> 03:25:52.680 align:start position:0%
abortion
 
03:25:54.950 --> 03:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
um the risk of sepsis infection again
 
03:25:58.790 --> 03:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
not having the baby fully expelled there
 
03:25:58.800 --> 03:25:59.809 align:start position:0%
not having the baby fully expelled there
is

03:25:59.809 --> 03:25:59.819 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:25:59.819 --> 03:26:00.590 align:start position:0%
is
um

03:26:00.590 --> 03:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:26:03.650 --> 03:26:03.660 align:start position:0%
necessity for informed consent to to
 
03:26:05.510 --> 03:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
make them aware of these risks so that
 
03:26:07.250 --> 03:26:07.260 align:start position:0%
they know fully going into these
 
03:26:08.269 --> 03:26:08.279 align:start position:0%
procedures whether it's a chemical
 
03:26:10.610 --> 03:26:10.620 align:start position:0%
abortion or a surgical abortion the
 
03:26:11.929 --> 03:26:11.939 align:start position:0%
impacts that could have on their own
 
03:26:11.939 --> 03:26:13.250 align:start position:0%
impacts that could have on their own
health

03:26:13.250 --> 03:26:13.260 align:start position:0%
health
 
03:26:16.690 --> 03:26:16.700 align:start position:0%
other questions to this Witness
 
03:26:18.950 --> 03:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you very much and if I
 
03:26:20.330 --> 03:26:20.340 align:start position:0%
could just I'm sorry briefly just one
 
03:26:22.130 --> 03:26:22.140 align:start position:0%
other thing another representative had a
 
03:26:23.510 --> 03:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
question about whether the bill requires
 
03:26:25.490 --> 03:26:25.500 align:start position:0%
an ultrasound it does not the build
 
03:26:27.650 --> 03:26:27.660 align:start position:0%
simply says that provides informed
 
03:26:28.790 --> 03:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
consent to a woman
 
03:26:31.070 --> 03:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
um to know whether or essentially the
 
03:26:34.670 --> 03:26:34.680 align:start position:0%
bill states that a woman will receive
 
03:26:36.710 --> 03:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
um a paperwork that says that she has
 
03:26:39.410 --> 03:26:39.420 align:start position:0%
the option to have an ultrasound and she
 
03:26:40.910 --> 03:26:40.920 align:start position:0%
is signing off on whether she wants an
 
03:26:42.349 --> 03:26:42.359 align:start position:0%
ultrasound or not
 
03:26:44.570 --> 03:26:44.580 align:start position:0%
um and also saying that she refuses to
 
03:26:46.010 --> 03:26:46.020 align:start position:0%
look at if she does get an ultrasound
 
03:26:47.330 --> 03:26:47.340 align:start position:0%
she's refusing to look at the pictures
 
03:26:49.309 --> 03:26:49.319 align:start position:0%
or she wants to select the pictures of
 
03:26:50.690 --> 03:26:50.700 align:start position:0%
the bill in and of itself does not
 
03:26:53.450 --> 03:26:53.460 align:start position:0%
require an ultrasound all right thank
 
03:26:58.010 --> 03:26:58.020 align:start position:0%
you uh Kayla Montgomery and next will be
 
03:27:03.950 --> 03:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:05.870 --> 03:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Kayla
 
03:27:07.370 --> 03:27:07.380 align:start position:0%
I'm the vice president of public affairs
 
03:27:08.809 --> 03:27:08.819 align:start position:0%
for Planned Parenthood of Northern New
 
03:27:08.819 --> 03:27:09.590 align:start position:0%
for Planned Parenthood of Northern New
England

03:27:09.590 --> 03:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
England
 
03:27:12.830 --> 03:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
we oppose house bill 562. it adds
 
03:27:15.410 --> 03:27:15.420 align:start position:0%
significant barriers to abortion care
 
03:27:17.510 --> 03:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
and it is a wash with misinformation and
 
03:27:19.849 --> 03:27:19.859 align:start position:0%
frankly shaming language so there's a
 
03:27:21.830 --> 03:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
few concerns with this bill I will get
 
03:27:22.729 --> 03:27:22.739 align:start position:0%
into them
 
03:27:25.250 --> 03:27:25.260 align:start position:0%
um the first uh the definition section
 
03:27:27.410 --> 03:27:27.420 align:start position:0%
of medical emergency
 
03:27:30.290 --> 03:27:30.300 align:start position:0%
it provides the definition that is not
 
03:27:32.330 --> 03:27:32.340 align:start position:0%
medically accurate in particular it
 
03:27:34.969 --> 03:27:34.979 align:start position:0%
carves out physiological or emotional
 
03:27:37.849 --> 03:27:37.859 align:start position:0%
conditions without any input or support
 
03:27:40.130 --> 03:27:40.140 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire's medical community
 
03:27:43.490 --> 03:27:43.500 align:start position:0%
also right below that in section B2 it
 
03:27:46.429 --> 03:27:46.439 align:start position:0%
appears to call into question who can
 
03:27:47.929 --> 03:27:47.939 align:start position:0%
provide an abortion in New Hampshire
 
03:27:51.590 --> 03:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
without any Clarity or any scientific or
 
03:27:51.600 --> 03:27:52.750 align:start position:0%
without any Clarity or any scientific or
medical

03:27:52.750 --> 03:27:52.760 align:start position:0%
medical
 
03:27:52.760 --> 03:27:54.290 align:start position:0%
medical
justification

03:27:54.290 --> 03:27:54.300 align:start position:0%
justification
 
03:27:57.050 --> 03:27:57.060 align:start position:0%
and then if you look at section B2 which
 
03:28:00.650 --> 03:28:00.660 align:start position:0%
is really just mostly all of page two it
 
03:28:03.950 --> 03:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
contains a list of medically inaccurate
 
03:28:06.229 --> 03:28:06.239 align:start position:0%
risks associated with medical with
 
03:28:07.910 --> 03:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
medication abortion
 
03:28:09.769 --> 03:28:09.779 align:start position:0%
so I want to be really perfectly clear
 
03:28:13.429 --> 03:28:13.439 align:start position:0%
there is absolutely no evidence that
 
03:28:16.490 --> 03:28:16.500 align:start position:0%
it's possible to counteract the effects
 
03:28:19.849 --> 03:28:19.859 align:start position:0%
of mephrystone as and as suggesting this
 
03:28:23.389 --> 03:28:23.399 align:start position:0%
to patients is frankly just bad medicine
 
03:28:24.889 --> 03:28:24.899 align:start position:0%
Planned Parenthood of Northern New
 
03:28:26.389 --> 03:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
England a New Hampshire abortion
 
03:28:28.910 --> 03:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
providers always provide trusted
 
03:28:30.650 --> 03:28:30.660 align:start position:0%
medically accurate information to
 
03:28:33.950 --> 03:28:33.960 align:start position:0%
patients and moreover by mandating that
 
03:28:35.690 --> 03:28:35.700 align:start position:0%
Healthcare Providers give patients
 
03:28:37.429 --> 03:28:37.439 align:start position:0%
misleading and potentially dangerous
 
03:28:40.070 --> 03:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
information this bill undermines the
 
03:28:42.349 --> 03:28:42.359 align:start position:0%
patient provider relationship and the
 
03:28:46.250 --> 03:28:46.260 align:start position:0%
entire informed consent process
 
03:28:49.729 --> 03:28:49.739 align:start position:0%
uh page three talks about
 
03:28:52.309 --> 03:28:52.319 align:start position:0%
um mandating that patient's weight 24
 
03:28:54.830 --> 03:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
hours after providing informed consent
 
03:28:57.410 --> 03:28:57.420 align:start position:0%
before getting their abortion again
 
03:28:59.450 --> 03:28:59.460 align:start position:0%
there's no medical justification for
 
03:29:01.610 --> 03:29:01.620 align:start position:0%
this requirement it will only cause
 
03:29:03.170 --> 03:29:03.180 align:start position:0%
further delays for patients and
 
03:29:03.180 --> 03:29:04.969 align:start position:0%
further delays for patients and
providers

03:29:04.969 --> 03:29:04.979 align:start position:0%
providers
 
03:29:08.150 --> 03:29:08.160 align:start position:0%
it is standard medical practice that
 
03:29:09.830 --> 03:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
when a patient schedules their
 
03:29:09.840 --> 03:29:10.670 align:start position:0%
when a patient schedules their
appointment

03:29:10.670 --> 03:29:10.680 align:start position:0%
appointment
 
03:29:13.910 --> 03:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
there is a mandatory consultation and
 
03:29:16.490 --> 03:29:16.500 align:start position:0%
that's included where the provider makes
 
03:29:18.130 --> 03:29:18.140 align:start position:0%
the page make sure that the patient
 
03:29:20.570 --> 03:29:20.580 align:start position:0%
understands all of the information about
 
03:29:23.210 --> 03:29:23.220 align:start position:0%
the process that the patient understands
 
03:29:26.030 --> 03:29:26.040 align:start position:0%
and is educated on their options
 
03:29:28.490 --> 03:29:28.500 align:start position:0%
and also there is a private screening to
 
03:29:29.990 --> 03:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
make sure that the patient is not being
 
03:29:32.870 --> 03:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
coerced in any way there's absolutely no
 
03:29:35.389 --> 03:29:35.399 align:start position:0%
exceptions to this protocol if a patient
 
03:29:37.250 --> 03:29:37.260 align:start position:0%
comes in and they don't speak English we
 
03:29:39.650 --> 03:29:39.660 align:start position:0%
provide translation services there's no
 
03:29:41.510 --> 03:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
exceptions here that is a part of every
 
03:29:44.150 --> 03:29:44.160 align:start position:0%
single abortion procedure mandatory
 
03:29:44.160 --> 03:29:45.290 align:start position:0%
single abortion procedure mandatory
consent

03:29:45.290 --> 03:29:45.300 align:start position:0%
consent
 
03:29:47.450 --> 03:29:47.460 align:start position:0%
so this bill would undermine the
 
03:29:49.190 --> 03:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
informed consent process by mandating
 
03:29:51.410 --> 03:29:51.420 align:start position:0%
that the provider give inaccurate
 
03:29:53.510 --> 03:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
information to their patients and then
 
03:29:55.250 --> 03:29:55.260 align:start position:0%
also it forces them to delay care for 24
 
03:29:57.530 --> 03:29:57.540 align:start position:0%
hours so this requirement interferes
 
03:29:59.750 --> 03:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
with the provided patient relationship
 
03:30:02.450 --> 03:30:02.460 align:start position:0%
and it creates unnecessary delays for
 
03:30:04.729 --> 03:30:04.739 align:start position:0%
women seeking time-sensitive care
 
03:30:08.150 --> 03:30:08.160 align:start position:0%
and finally uh if you look at page four
 
03:30:11.150 --> 03:30:11.160 align:start position:0%
the bill requires DHHS to post
 
03:30:13.729 --> 03:30:13.739 align:start position:0%
information on their website and offer a
 
03:30:16.130 --> 03:30:16.140 align:start position:0%
24-hour phone line without a lot of
 
03:30:18.050 --> 03:30:18.060 align:start position:0%
details frankly
 
03:30:19.670 --> 03:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
um nowhere in this section does it
 
03:30:21.590 --> 03:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
explain how the information will be
 
03:30:24.349 --> 03:30:24.359 align:start position:0%
compiled monitored updated distributed
 
03:30:27.950 --> 03:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
or paid for by so uh overall this bill
 
03:30:29.630 --> 03:30:29.640 align:start position:0%
is full of medically inaccurate
 
03:30:31.490 --> 03:30:31.500 align:start position:0%
stigmatizing and frankly confusing
 
03:30:31.500 --> 03:30:32.690 align:start position:0%
stigmatizing and frankly confusing
language

03:30:32.690 --> 03:30:32.700 align:start position:0%
language
 
03:30:34.550 --> 03:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
Granite Cedars seeking abortion care
 
03:30:36.889 --> 03:30:36.899 align:start position:0%
already receive complete and accurate
 
03:30:38.750 --> 03:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
information from trains providers
 
03:30:40.670 --> 03:30:40.680 align:start position:0%
regarding their abortion care and we
 
03:30:42.410 --> 03:30:42.420 align:start position:0%
would urge this committee to itl House
 
03:30:44.269 --> 03:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
Bill fives all right questions for this
 
03:30:44.279 --> 03:30:45.710 align:start position:0%
Bill fives all right questions for this
week

03:30:45.710 --> 03:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
week
 
03:30:50.570 --> 03:30:50.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:53.570 --> 03:30:53.580 align:start position:0%
so when are individuals coming into
 
03:30:56.030 --> 03:30:56.040 align:start position:0%
playing Parenthood given all this
 
03:30:56.040 --> 03:30:57.530 align:start position:0%
playing Parenthood given all this
information

03:30:57.530 --> 03:30:57.540 align:start position:0%
information
 
03:31:00.170 --> 03:31:00.180 align:start position:0%
so a person does not just come in off
 
03:31:01.910 --> 03:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
the street a person makes an appointment
 
03:31:04.550 --> 03:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
generally online or they call our health
 
03:31:04.560 --> 03:31:05.450 align:start position:0%
generally online or they call our health
center

03:31:05.450 --> 03:31:05.460 align:start position:0%
center
 
03:31:08.210 --> 03:31:08.220 align:start position:0%
during that first initial process the
 
03:31:10.130 --> 03:31:10.140 align:start position:0%
beginning conversation happens the
 
03:31:12.170 --> 03:31:12.180 align:start position:0%
conversation about what's going to occur
 
03:31:15.290 --> 03:31:15.300 align:start position:0%
during the process maybe some talk about
 
03:31:18.650 --> 03:31:18.660 align:start position:0%
maybe you'll see protesters what to do
 
03:31:20.570 --> 03:31:20.580 align:start position:0%
in that event if you're coming into a
 
03:31:21.830 --> 03:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
health center so those conversations
 
03:31:26.330 --> 03:31:26.340 align:start position:0%
begin and then once the um once the
 
03:31:28.849 --> 03:31:28.859 align:start position:0%
procedure once the appointment happens
 
03:31:31.550 --> 03:31:31.560 align:start position:0%
that conversation happens before the
 
03:31:33.650 --> 03:31:33.660 align:start position:0%
abortion and those questions are
 
03:31:36.050 --> 03:31:36.060 align:start position:0%
repeated around do you understand what's
 
03:31:37.490 --> 03:31:37.500 align:start position:0%
happening all of those questions are
 
03:31:39.050 --> 03:31:39.060 align:start position:0%
repeated throughout the procedure as
 
03:31:41.469 --> 03:31:41.479 align:start position:0%
well just to really ensure yeah
 
03:31:44.510 --> 03:31:44.520 align:start position:0%
can I just ask you to hang on just like
 
03:31:46.809 --> 03:31:46.819 align:start position:0%
one second I'm going to recognize
 
03:31:49.130 --> 03:31:49.140 align:start position:0%
representative Manos because I
 
03:31:51.590 --> 03:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
understand that some of her constituents
 
03:32:00.170 --> 03:32:00.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:02.150 --> 03:32:02.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
03:32:04.490 --> 03:32:04.500 align:start position:0%
um strata middle school is here today
 
03:32:07.550 --> 03:32:07.560 align:start position:0%
fourth graders and I'm very happy to
 
03:32:25.429 --> 03:32:25.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:27.170 --> 03:32:27.180 align:start position:0%
could I just ask if they have any
 
03:32:27.180 --> 03:32:29.090 align:start position:0%
could I just ask if they have any
questions

03:32:29.090 --> 03:32:29.100 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:32:31.370 --> 03:32:31.380 align:start position:0%
I was just wondering whether perhaps you
 
03:32:33.290 --> 03:32:33.300 align:start position:0%
have any questions that you would want
 
03:32:47.050 --> 03:32:47.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:52.550 --> 03:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:57.050 --> 03:32:57.060 align:start position:0%
yes it absolutely is I'm uh I'm a
 
03:32:59.150 --> 03:32:59.160 align:start position:0%
freshman so this is the first time I've
 
03:33:11.830 --> 03:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:28.370 --> 03:33:28.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:31.370 --> 03:33:31.380 align:start position:0%
well one of our jobs is to hear people's
 
03:33:33.769 --> 03:33:33.779 align:start position:0%
opinions on the bills that we're
 
03:33:36.110 --> 03:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
considering it's a very Democratic
 
03:33:39.710 --> 03:33:39.720 align:start position:0%
process with a small D so anyone can
 
03:33:42.050 --> 03:33:42.060 align:start position:0%
come and give us their opinion on what
 
03:33:44.570 --> 03:33:44.580 align:start position:0%
we're working on and it's a lot of fun
 
03:33:47.630 --> 03:33:47.640 align:start position:0%
to hear people talk about their views on
 
03:33:50.269 --> 03:33:50.279 align:start position:0%
the bills we're considering
 
03:33:59.809 --> 03:33:59.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:02.150 --> 03:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
well thank thank you thank you so much
 
03:34:16.790 --> 03:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:27.650 --> 03:34:27.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:38.510 --> 03:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:40.969 --> 03:34:40.979 align:start position:0%
I have a follow-up please when they're
 
03:34:40.979 --> 03:34:42.290 align:start position:0%
I have a follow-up please when they're
out

03:34:42.290 --> 03:34:42.300 align:start position:0%
out
 
03:35:01.729 --> 03:35:01.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:04.250 --> 03:35:04.260 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:35:06.290 --> 03:35:06.300 align:start position:0%
um yes I I'm sorry you you please
 
03:35:07.969 --> 03:35:07.979 align:start position:0%
continue your your answer to the
 
03:35:07.979 --> 03:35:09.130 align:start position:0%
continue your your answer to the
question

03:35:09.130 --> 03:35:09.140 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:35:12.769 --> 03:35:12.779 align:start position:0%
yes representative Burris I'm sorry I
 
03:35:15.650 --> 03:35:15.660 align:start position:0%
still don't understand so I go online
 
03:35:18.349 --> 03:35:18.359 align:start position:0%
and I make an appointment
 
03:35:20.210 --> 03:35:20.220 align:start position:0%
does someone call me and go through all
 
03:35:22.670 --> 03:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
this or does it happen when I walk into
 
03:35:23.809 --> 03:35:23.819 align:start position:0%
the clinic
 
03:35:26.150 --> 03:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
so it could be a couple times someone
 
03:35:28.429 --> 03:35:28.439 align:start position:0%
will call and talk to them about their
 
03:35:30.050 --> 03:35:30.060 align:start position:0%
upcoming appointment make sure that
 
03:35:32.630 --> 03:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
they're still wanting to come
 
03:35:35.150 --> 03:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
um talk about what sort of what they can
 
03:35:40.429 --> 03:35:40.439 align:start position:0%
expect if it is a uh if it is an
 
03:35:42.290 --> 03:35:42.300 align:start position:0%
abortion in our health center talk about
 
03:35:44.090 --> 03:35:44.100 align:start position:0%
maybe how much time they need that they
 
03:35:46.010 --> 03:35:46.020 align:start position:0%
can bring a support person you know
 
03:35:47.630 --> 03:35:47.640 align:start position:0%
basic things like that
 
03:35:49.610 --> 03:35:49.620 align:start position:0%
um and then once they're there the
 
03:35:51.469 --> 03:35:51.479 align:start position:0%
conversation around
 
03:35:53.389 --> 03:35:53.399 align:start position:0%
um the private screening to do the to
 
03:35:54.710 --> 03:35:54.720 align:start position:0%
make sure there's no coercion that type
 
03:35:56.210 --> 03:35:56.220 align:start position:0%
of thing happens
 
03:35:57.650 --> 03:35:57.660 align:start position:0%
other question
 
03:36:01.370 --> 03:36:01.380 align:start position:0%
yes follow up I'm sorry so I call for an
 
03:36:03.229 --> 03:36:03.239 align:start position:0%
appointment someone calls me back I'm
 
03:36:05.330 --> 03:36:05.340 align:start position:0%
going to assume that and tells me I have
 
03:36:06.889 --> 03:36:06.899 align:start position:0%
to be there at such and such a time like
 
03:36:09.110 --> 03:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
every other appointment that we go on in
 
03:36:12.469 --> 03:36:12.479 align:start position:0%
our lives but the actual consultation
 
03:36:16.490 --> 03:36:16.500 align:start position:0%
about exactly the procedure
 
03:36:16.500 --> 03:36:17.450 align:start position:0%
about exactly the procedure
um

03:36:17.450 --> 03:36:17.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:21.170 --> 03:36:21.180 align:start position:0%
and all of that does not occur in my
 
03:36:23.510 --> 03:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
understanding until the appointment and
 
03:36:26.450 --> 03:36:26.460 align:start position:0%
also at that time
 
03:36:29.630 --> 03:36:29.640 align:start position:0%
are any other options given to the
 
03:36:32.330 --> 03:36:32.340 align:start position:0%
person and if you do a private
 
03:36:36.110 --> 03:36:36.120 align:start position:0%
consultation about a possibility of uh
 
03:36:39.950 --> 03:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:42.530 --> 03:36:42.540 align:start position:0%
they're not given time I mean so then
 
03:36:46.190 --> 03:36:46.200 align:start position:0%
it's either decide now or don't decide I
 
03:36:49.750 --> 03:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
mean I do there's no time
 
03:36:52.790 --> 03:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
process all this before you make the
 
03:36:54.950 --> 03:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
decision yeah so as I mentioned
 
03:36:57.769 --> 03:36:57.779 align:start position:0%
um absolutely all options are given to
 
03:36:59.690 --> 03:36:59.700 align:start position:0%
the patient and we're not talking about
 
03:37:02.330 --> 03:37:02.340 align:start position:0%
once this isn't you know a rut is this
 
03:37:03.769 --> 03:37:03.779 align:start position:0%
is something that's rushed this is
 
03:37:06.710 --> 03:37:06.720 align:start position:0%
patient-centered Care at any point the
 
03:37:09.650 --> 03:37:09.660 align:start position:0%
person can change their mind there is no
 
03:37:11.450 --> 03:37:11.460 align:start position:0%
every patient's going to be different
 
03:37:13.010 --> 03:37:13.020 align:start position:0%
and that's why these questions are going
 
03:37:14.750 --> 03:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
to be repeated multiple times to make
 
03:37:15.950 --> 03:37:15.960 align:start position:0%
sure that the patient is still feeling
 
03:37:17.990 --> 03:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
comfortable in their decision
 
03:37:19.910 --> 03:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
if they decide that they want to come
 
03:37:21.769 --> 03:37:21.779 align:start position:0%
back next week if they decide you know
 
03:37:24.950 --> 03:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
what I have a consultation I had you
 
03:37:26.750 --> 03:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
know I I'm not comfortable I want to
 
03:37:28.490 --> 03:37:28.500 align:start position:0%
maybe give it a few more days
 
03:37:30.650 --> 03:37:30.660 align:start position:0%
that's fine it's every situation is
 
03:37:31.610 --> 03:37:31.620 align:start position:0%
going to be different and we are going
 
03:37:33.050 --> 03:37:33.060 align:start position:0%
to work with that patient to make sure
 
03:37:34.429 --> 03:37:34.439 align:start position:0%
that every patient has what they need to
 
03:37:37.010 --> 03:37:37.020 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable and if it's not a
 
03:37:38.510 --> 03:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
decision that they want to make at that
 
03:37:40.729 --> 03:37:40.739 align:start position:0%
moment that's fine
 
03:37:43.729 --> 03:37:43.739 align:start position:0%
other question for this Witness
 
03:37:46.729 --> 03:37:46.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:46.739 --> 03:37:47.929 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

03:37:47.929 --> 03:37:47.939 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
03:37:49.790 --> 03:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
03:37:51.889 --> 03:37:51.899 align:start position:0%
your testimony you said that the the
 
03:37:54.530 --> 03:37:54.540 align:start position:0%
information on page two regarding the
 
03:37:57.889 --> 03:37:57.899 align:start position:0%
pepperstone and uh progesterone is
 
03:37:59.710 --> 03:37:59.720 align:start position:0%
medically inaccurate information
 
03:38:02.809 --> 03:38:02.819 align:start position:0%
I don't think that the sponsors of this
 
03:38:05.030 --> 03:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
bill intended to provide medically and
 
03:38:06.309 --> 03:38:06.319 align:start position:0%
accurate information
 
03:38:08.690 --> 03:38:08.700 align:start position:0%
although if there's a possibility of it
 
03:38:10.429 --> 03:38:10.439 align:start position:0%
being inaccurate then obviously it would
 
03:38:12.590 --> 03:38:12.600 align:start position:0%
need to be corrected
 
03:38:15.610 --> 03:38:15.620 align:start position:0%
that aside would you please explain
 
03:38:18.830 --> 03:38:18.840 align:start position:0%
uh how a chemical abortion takes place
 
03:38:22.010 --> 03:38:22.020 align:start position:0%
what what is Buffett Stone uh and the
 
03:38:23.929 --> 03:38:23.939 align:start position:0%
relationship with progesterone and why
 
03:38:26.210 --> 03:38:26.220 align:start position:0%
this would have even been introduced if
 
03:38:31.610 --> 03:38:31.620 align:start position:0%
there wasn't some basis in reality
 
03:38:33.229 --> 03:38:33.239 align:start position:0%
can you just explain where this might
 
03:38:34.969 --> 03:38:34.979 align:start position:0%
have come from sure so medication
 
03:38:37.670 --> 03:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
abortions Two drugs
 
03:38:39.769 --> 03:38:39.779 align:start position:0%
used together
 
03:38:43.550 --> 03:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
um so the what I am understanding from
 
03:38:45.050 --> 03:38:45.060 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:38:47.269 --> 03:38:47.279 align:start position:0%
is that it is
 
03:38:49.849 --> 03:38:49.859 align:start position:0%
trying to say that you can reverse a
 
03:38:51.830 --> 03:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
medication abortion that is what I
 
03:38:53.750 --> 03:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
believe this bill is trying to indicate
 
03:38:58.309 --> 03:38:58.319 align:start position:0%
there is no uh there is no basis and
 
03:39:00.229 --> 03:39:00.239 align:start position:0%
facts for that there's no
 
03:39:02.210 --> 03:39:02.220 align:start position:0%
the FDA has not said that that is a
 
03:39:03.830 --> 03:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
situation there's been no that does not
 
03:39:06.590 --> 03:39:06.600 align:start position:0%
happen so suggesting otherwise is just
 
03:39:06.600 --> 03:39:07.670 align:start position:0%
happen so suggesting otherwise is just
simply

03:39:07.670 --> 03:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
simply
 
03:39:09.889 --> 03:39:09.899 align:start position:0%
um Bad Medicine
 
03:39:13.010 --> 03:39:13.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:15.889 --> 03:39:15.899 align:start position:0%
yes representative Church
 
03:39:18.229 --> 03:39:18.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and and thank you for
 
03:39:20.269 --> 03:39:20.279 align:start position:0%
your testimony as well um
 
03:39:22.429 --> 03:39:22.439 align:start position:0%
in in terms of informed consent I know
 
03:39:25.130 --> 03:39:25.140 align:start position:0%
Planned Parenthood provides uh uh
 
03:39:26.450 --> 03:39:26.460 align:start position:0%
abortion services and many other
 
03:39:26.460 --> 03:39:28.849 align:start position:0%
abortion services and many other
services

03:39:28.849 --> 03:39:28.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:31.670 --> 03:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
isn't the primary or uh purpose for
 
03:39:34.610 --> 03:39:34.620 align:start position:0%
giving informed consent both sort of
 
03:39:37.309 --> 03:39:37.319 align:start position:0%
standard of care and to address medical
 
03:39:40.370 --> 03:39:40.380 align:start position:0%
legal issues and uh short of having this
 
03:39:40.380 --> 03:39:41.750 align:start position:0%
legal issues and uh short of having this
law

03:39:41.750 --> 03:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
law
 
03:39:43.690 --> 03:39:43.700 align:start position:0%
um what would be your your your
 
03:39:46.370 --> 03:39:46.380 align:start position:0%
expectations of your staff in terms of
 
03:39:46.380 --> 03:39:48.110 align:start position:0%
expectations of your staff in terms of
that

03:39:48.110 --> 03:39:48.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:39:50.150 --> 03:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
nothing would if this is standard
 
03:39:52.070 --> 03:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
medical guidelines this is something
 
03:39:55.429 --> 03:39:55.439 align:start position:0%
that we are a health care provider we
 
03:39:57.410 --> 03:39:57.420 align:start position:0%
follow all standard medical guidelines
 
03:40:00.650 --> 03:40:00.660 align:start position:0%
and all medical ethics so informed
 
03:40:02.570 --> 03:40:02.580 align:start position:0%
consent is just simply a part of the
 
03:40:06.110 --> 03:40:06.120 align:start position:0%
process and not just once but throughout
 
03:40:08.269 --> 03:40:08.279 align:start position:0%
can I just do a quick follow-up yeah um
 
03:40:11.450 --> 03:40:11.460 align:start position:0%
in in terms of your medical liability
 
03:40:13.729 --> 03:40:13.739 align:start position:0%
um it would would you have would you
 
03:40:15.769 --> 03:40:15.779 align:start position:0%
feel that there are concerns if this
 
03:40:17.990 --> 03:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
were not being given um in terms of
 
03:40:19.490 --> 03:40:19.500 align:start position:0%
consequences to the organization
 
03:40:21.950 --> 03:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely we fought like like I said we
 
03:40:23.210 --> 03:40:23.220 align:start position:0%
follow all standard Medicals and
 
03:40:25.550 --> 03:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
guidelines we are a Health Care
 
03:40:27.710 --> 03:40:27.720 align:start position:0%
Organization that operates within the
 
03:40:29.870 --> 03:40:29.880 align:start position:0%
law of the State of New Hampshire we are
 
03:40:31.610 --> 03:40:31.620 align:start position:0%
licensed medical professionals and we
 
03:40:33.170 --> 03:40:33.180 align:start position:0%
would never do anything to jeopardize
 
03:40:34.670 --> 03:40:34.680 align:start position:0%
that because that means our patients
 
03:40:36.830 --> 03:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
could not rely on us for care anymore we
 
03:40:38.809 --> 03:40:38.819 align:start position:0%
would never jeopardize that
 
03:40:42.469 --> 03:40:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:44.929 --> 03:40:44.939 align:start position:0%
yes representative Stapleton
 
03:40:48.110 --> 03:40:48.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
03:40:53.330 --> 03:40:53.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:54.710 --> 03:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
um and I don't know whether this is
 
03:40:58.190 --> 03:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
valid or not but uh PubMed
 
03:41:01.490 --> 03:41:01.500 align:start position:0%
made a made a statement in the study of
 
03:41:05.750 --> 03:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
the use of progesterone to counteract
 
03:41:08.690 --> 03:41:08.700 align:start position:0%
the Memphis Stone
 
03:41:11.570 --> 03:41:11.580 align:start position:0%
case reports four of six women who took
 
03:41:14.210 --> 03:41:14.220 align:start position:0%
Memphis Stone were able to carry their
 
03:41:17.110 --> 03:41:17.120 align:start position:0%
pregnancies to term after receiving
 
03:41:20.330 --> 03:41:20.340 align:start position:0%
intramuscular progesterone 200
 
03:41:23.330 --> 03:41:23.340 align:start position:0%
milligrams now I don't know if PubMed is
 
03:41:26.750 --> 03:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
a valid source or respected Source or
 
03:41:26.760 --> 03:41:28.070 align:start position:0%
a valid source or respected Source or
not

03:41:28.070 --> 03:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:41:30.769 --> 03:41:30.779 align:start position:0%
um but would you care to comment on that
 
03:41:33.830 --> 03:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
particular case report
 
03:41:36.110 --> 03:41:36.120 align:start position:0%
yeah I would just repeat that there has
 
03:41:36.120 --> 03:41:37.130 align:start position:0%
yeah I would just repeat that there has
been

03:41:37.130 --> 03:41:37.140 align:start position:0%
been
 
03:41:39.110 --> 03:41:39.120 align:start position:0%
no documentation that you can reverse
 
03:41:40.429 --> 03:41:40.439 align:start position:0%
the medication abortion than anything
 
03:41:43.250 --> 03:41:43.260 align:start position:0%
else I would consider drug science
 
03:41:46.429 --> 03:41:46.439 align:start position:0%
other questions for this Witness
 
03:41:50.210 --> 03:41:50.220 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you
 
03:41:53.330 --> 03:41:53.340 align:start position:0%
I'm going to call next on Josie uh pinto
 
03:41:55.070 --> 03:41:55.080 align:start position:0%
and after that the next one will be
 
03:41:58.309 --> 03:41:58.319 align:start position:0%
Maris Holland
 
03:42:00.650 --> 03:42:00.660 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Representatives I'm here
 
03:42:02.150 --> 03:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
again to represent the views of the
 
03:42:03.469 --> 03:42:03.479 align:start position:0%
reproductive Freedom fund of New
 
03:42:05.570 --> 03:42:05.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm here to urge you all
 
03:42:08.870 --> 03:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
to oppose HB 562.
 
03:42:11.210 --> 03:42:11.220 align:start position:0%
every day my job is to help patients
 
03:42:13.910 --> 03:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
access abortion care that is often not
 
03:42:16.190 --> 03:42:16.200 align:start position:0%
an easy thing for many of them to do
 
03:42:18.650 --> 03:42:18.660 align:start position:0%
between the cost of the procedure the
 
03:42:20.210 --> 03:42:20.220 align:start position:0%
need to take time off from work or
 
03:42:22.309 --> 03:42:22.319 align:start position:0%
school arrange child care and
 
03:42:24.469 --> 03:42:24.479 align:start position:0%
transportation there are many barriers
 
03:42:26.269 --> 03:42:26.279 align:start position:0%
that exist for patients looking to
 
03:42:27.889 --> 03:42:27.899 align:start position:0%
access abortion care
 
03:42:31.250 --> 03:42:31.260 align:start position:0%
let's be clear this bill only serves as
 
03:42:33.290 --> 03:42:33.300 align:start position:0%
one more barrier that would absolutely
 
03:42:35.269 --> 03:42:35.279 align:start position:0%
lead to increased difficulty for
 
03:42:38.030 --> 03:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
patients looking to access abortion this
 
03:42:40.130 --> 03:42:40.140 align:start position:0%
bill would push abortion Out Of Reach
 
03:42:41.929 --> 03:42:41.939 align:start position:0%
for many
 
03:42:43.910 --> 03:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
I have experience working in a clinic
 
03:42:46.309 --> 03:42:46.319 align:start position:0%
that provides abortion and in that role
 
03:42:48.170 --> 03:42:48.180 align:start position:0%
I helped to counsel patients around the
 
03:42:50.330 --> 03:42:50.340 align:start position:0%
options available to them I can
 
03:42:52.790 --> 03:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
personally attest that this process is
 
03:42:54.889 --> 03:42:54.899 align:start position:0%
completely rooted in informed consent
 
03:42:57.410 --> 03:42:57.420 align:start position:0%
making sure the patient is aware of all
 
03:42:58.969 --> 03:42:58.979 align:start position:0%
their options so that they are able to
 
03:43:01.370 --> 03:43:01.380 align:start position:0%
make the best decision possible for them
 
03:43:04.190 --> 03:43:04.200 align:start position:0%
there is no need for someone to take 24
 
03:43:06.290 --> 03:43:06.300 align:start position:0%
hours to make their decision once they
 
03:43:07.370 --> 03:43:07.380 align:start position:0%
have come in for their initial
 
03:43:07.380 --> 03:43:08.389 align:start position:0%
have come in for their initial
appointment

03:43:08.389 --> 03:43:08.399 align:start position:0%
appointment
 
03:43:09.950 --> 03:43:09.960 align:start position:0%
patients that show up to their
 
03:43:11.990 --> 03:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
appointments know what decision they are
 
03:43:14.030 --> 03:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
making and if they decide against an
 
03:43:15.950 --> 03:43:15.960 align:start position:0%
abortion we are there to provide them
 
03:43:18.229 --> 03:43:18.239 align:start position:0%
the support and resources they need
 
03:43:20.150 --> 03:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
if they have questions ahead of time
 
03:43:21.769 --> 03:43:21.779 align:start position:0%
typically those are addressed through
 
03:43:23.269 --> 03:43:23.279 align:start position:0%
the initial intake call when they
 
03:43:25.130 --> 03:43:25.140 align:start position:0%
schedule their appointment
 
03:43:27.410 --> 03:43:27.420 align:start position:0%
if a patient wants to take their time to
 
03:43:29.630 --> 03:43:29.640 align:start position:0%
think about it then clinics absolutely
 
03:43:31.870 --> 03:43:31.880 align:start position:0%
understand that and respect their wishes
 
03:43:34.849 --> 03:43:34.859 align:start position:0%
this is all to say there is absolutely
 
03:43:37.550 --> 03:43:37.560 align:start position:0%
no need to mandate a 24-hour waiting
 
03:43:39.710 --> 03:43:39.720 align:start position:0%
period because patients can determine
 
03:43:42.950 --> 03:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
for themselves when they should get care
 
03:43:45.590 --> 03:43:45.600 align:start position:0%
as with many of these bills I ask you
 
03:43:48.469 --> 03:43:48.479 align:start position:0%
all to trust patients trust providers
 
03:43:51.170 --> 03:43:51.180 align:start position:0%
let us not interfere with their ability
 
03:43:52.670 --> 03:43:52.680 align:start position:0%
to make these incredibly personal
 
03:43:55.370 --> 03:43:55.380 align:start position:0%
decisions but let's instead provide them
 
03:43:57.769 --> 03:43:57.779 align:start position:0%
with a compassionate fact-based
 
03:43:59.570 --> 03:43:59.580 align:start position:0%
information and care they deserve
 
03:44:02.210 --> 03:44:02.220 align:start position:0%
regardless of what they choose I urge
 
03:44:05.150 --> 03:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
you all to vote against HB 562 thank you
 
03:44:08.990 --> 03:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:11.450 --> 03:44:11.460 align:start position:0%
representative Gleason thank you Mr
 
03:44:14.269 --> 03:44:14.279 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for your testimony I
 
03:44:17.929 --> 03:44:17.939 align:start position:0%
this is genuinely I do not know how much
 
03:44:21.950 --> 03:44:21.960 align:start position:0%
does an abortion cost roughly 500 though
 
03:44:24.170 --> 03:44:24.180 align:start position:0%
if gestational limit is higher it goes
 
03:44:28.070 --> 03:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
up from there but on average 500.
 
03:44:31.490 --> 03:44:31.500 align:start position:0%
further questions for this Witness
 
03:44:33.410 --> 03:44:33.420 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you you know what I
 
03:44:34.849 --> 03:44:34.859 align:start position:0%
realized I've
 
03:44:38.269 --> 03:44:38.279 align:start position:0%
I think I overlooked uh Omer Hearn it
 
03:44:40.610 --> 03:44:40.620 align:start position:0%
was uh to testify next and then uh
 
03:44:43.070 --> 03:44:43.080 align:start position:0%
Marist uh Tolland I will get to you as
 
03:44:46.190 --> 03:44:46.200 align:start position:0%
the very next wish thank you so uh Mr
 
03:44:50.630 --> 03:44:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:53.690 --> 03:44:53.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
03:44:56.750 --> 03:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
03:45:00.229 --> 03:45:00.239 align:start position:0%
again my name is Omer Ahern Jr I'm from
 
03:45:02.269 --> 03:45:02.279 align:start position:0%
Wentworth New Hampshire
 
03:45:09.410 --> 03:45:09.420 align:start position:0%
and I am in support of House Bill 562
 
03:45:15.590 --> 03:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:18.469 --> 03:45:18.479 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
03:45:21.830 --> 03:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:24.889 --> 03:45:24.899 align:start position:0%
the most precious thing
 
03:45:28.790 --> 03:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:31.190 --> 03:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
our country was based upon the concept
 
03:45:32.510 --> 03:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
of life
 
03:45:36.769 --> 03:45:36.779 align:start position:0%
liberty and the pursuit of happiness
 
03:45:40.550 --> 03:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
every day we're all faced with
 
03:45:40.560 --> 03:45:41.809 align:start position:0%
every day we're all faced with
uh

03:45:41.809 --> 03:45:41.819 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:45:43.729 --> 03:45:43.739 align:start position:0%
situations where
 
03:45:46.790 --> 03:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
we're asked to sign a consent form
 
03:45:49.610 --> 03:45:49.620 align:start position:0%
and you know we're we're adults
 
03:45:52.370 --> 03:45:52.380 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about I believe with
 
03:45:54.130 --> 03:45:54.140 align:start position:0%
regard to house bill
 
03:45:56.570 --> 03:45:56.580 align:start position:0%
562-aff then
 
03:45:59.269 --> 03:45:59.279 align:start position:0%
the reality of all this is that we are
 
03:46:03.229 --> 03:46:03.239 align:start position:0%
discussing some very unique
 
03:46:06.469 --> 03:46:06.479 align:start position:0%
special circumstances
 
03:46:10.790 --> 03:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
as they apply to a second
 
03:46:10.800 --> 03:46:13.610 align:start position:0%
as they apply to a second
life

03:46:13.610 --> 03:46:13.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:17.210 --> 03:46:17.220 align:start position:0%
and I just believe no matter what the
 
03:46:17.220 --> 03:46:20.330 align:start position:0%
and I just believe no matter what the
cost

03:46:20.330 --> 03:46:20.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:23.809 --> 03:46:23.819 align:start position:0%
to to protect life
 
03:46:26.389 --> 03:46:26.399 align:start position:0%
we need to be able to do that
 
03:46:31.250 --> 03:46:31.260 align:start position:0%
because life is invaluable
 
03:46:34.610 --> 03:46:34.620 align:start position:0%
and to require
 
03:46:37.729 --> 03:46:37.739 align:start position:0%
the mother to
 
03:46:41.870 --> 03:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
get the necessary information again in
 
03:46:44.389 --> 03:46:44.399 align:start position:0%
my line of work I've seen situations
 
03:46:47.170 --> 03:46:47.180 align:start position:0%
where people are not given information
 
03:46:49.969 --> 03:46:49.979 align:start position:0%
they are coerced
 
03:46:52.790 --> 03:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
they are misled
 
03:46:55.610 --> 03:46:55.620 align:start position:0%
and all where I believe all we're trying
 
03:46:57.650 --> 03:46:57.660 align:start position:0%
to do here especially
 
03:47:01.910 --> 03:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
in the way our society has changed so
 
03:47:04.610 --> 03:47:04.620 align:start position:0%
much over the last 40 years
 
03:47:09.110 --> 03:47:09.120 align:start position:0%
we really need to make sure that these
 
03:47:12.650 --> 03:47:12.660 align:start position:0%
folks these women and many of them are
 
03:47:15.769 --> 03:47:15.779 align:start position:0%
very young but that they're getting the
 
03:47:19.370 --> 03:47:19.380 align:start position:0%
proper information so that they can make
 
03:47:21.429 --> 03:47:21.439 align:start position:0%
the right decision
 
03:47:24.349 --> 03:47:24.359 align:start position:0%
knowledge is so important
 
03:47:29.389 --> 03:47:29.399 align:start position:0%
and in my mind in these special sets of
 
03:47:29.399 --> 03:47:31.309 align:start position:0%
and in my mind in these special sets of
circumstances

03:47:31.309 --> 03:47:31.319 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
03:47:34.849 --> 03:47:34.859 align:start position:0%
it is better to err on the side of
 
03:47:34.859 --> 03:47:35.990 align:start position:0%
it is better to err on the side of
caution

03:47:35.990 --> 03:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
caution
 
03:47:39.050 --> 03:47:39.060 align:start position:0%
to protect life
 
03:47:43.550 --> 03:47:43.560 align:start position:0%
again I ask you to support
 
03:47:46.330 --> 03:47:46.340 align:start position:0%
the passage of House Bill
 
03:47:50.750 --> 03:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
562 FN all right questions questions to
 
03:47:54.010 --> 03:47:54.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:57.110 --> 03:47:57.120 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much next is
 
03:48:00.410 --> 03:48:00.420 align:start position:0%
Maris Tolland and then after Miss
 
03:48:06.170 --> 03:48:06.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:08.330 --> 03:48:08.340 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is actually
 
03:48:12.050 --> 03:48:12.060 align:start position:0%
Janelle Hobson Dr Tolland had to go back
 
03:48:13.370 --> 03:48:13.380 align:start position:0%
to the hospital
 
03:48:14.690 --> 03:48:14.700 align:start position:0%
um and she has asked me to read her
 
03:48:24.650 --> 03:48:24.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:27.050 --> 03:48:27.060 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this legislation is not
 
03:48:29.389 --> 03:48:29.399 align:start position:0%
to provide informed consent which
 
03:48:31.070 --> 03:48:31.080 align:start position:0%
already happens in the medical offices
 
03:48:33.590 --> 03:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
by the way the purpose is to make it
 
03:48:35.809 --> 03:48:35.819 align:start position:0%
challenging or impossible for patients
 
03:48:38.269 --> 03:48:38.279 align:start position:0%
to access abortion services
 
03:48:40.910 --> 03:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
this bill belittles the decision-making
 
03:48:43.429 --> 03:48:43.439 align:start position:0%
power in individual autonomy of your
 
03:48:43.439 --> 03:48:44.330 align:start position:0%
power in individual autonomy of your
neighbors

03:48:44.330 --> 03:48:44.340 align:start position:0%
neighbors
 
03:48:46.849 --> 03:48:46.859 align:start position:0%
who are you to understand or dictate how
 
03:48:49.729 --> 03:48:49.739 align:start position:0%
others make decisions the government's
 
03:48:51.889 --> 03:48:51.899 align:start position:0%
job is not to give timelines for
 
03:48:53.570 --> 03:48:53.580 align:start position:0%
personal choices
 
03:48:56.570 --> 03:48:56.580 align:start position:0%
what's more this bill is mandating that
 
03:48:58.729 --> 03:48:58.739 align:start position:0%
I lie to my patients
 
03:49:01.429 --> 03:49:01.439 align:start position:0%
a randomized controlled trial was
 
03:49:04.849 --> 03:49:04.859 align:start position:0%
performed in 2020 in order to estimate
 
03:49:07.990 --> 03:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
the efficacy and safety of
 
03:49:10.670 --> 03:49:10.680 align:start position:0%
persist Stone
 
03:49:13.190 --> 03:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
um antagonization with progesterone
 
03:49:16.370 --> 03:49:16.380 align:start position:0%
progesterone sorry about that that is to
 
03:49:19.070 --> 03:49:19.080 align:start position:0%
say looking at this non-fda approved
 
03:49:22.130 --> 03:49:22.140 align:start position:0%
therapy to stop abortion process
 
03:49:25.010 --> 03:49:25.020 align:start position:0%
that is mentioned in this film
 
03:49:28.070 --> 03:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
the study was unsuccessful at estimating
 
03:49:31.610 --> 03:49:31.620 align:start position:0%
the efficacy of progesterone for halting
 
03:49:34.010 --> 03:49:34.020 align:start position:0%
the abortion process due to safety
 
03:49:36.290 --> 03:49:36.300 align:start position:0%
concerns when the medication abortion
 
03:49:38.690 --> 03:49:38.700 align:start position:0%
was only half completed
 
03:49:41.150 --> 03:49:41.160 align:start position:0%
the study had to stop early because
 
03:49:43.070 --> 03:49:43.080 align:start position:0%
several patients undergoing this
 
03:49:44.809 --> 03:49:44.819 align:start position:0%
experimental therapy
 
03:49:47.389 --> 03:49:47.399 align:start position:0%
underwent severe Hemorrhage requiring
 
03:49:49.910 --> 03:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
ambulance transportation to an emergency
 
03:49:49.920 --> 03:49:51.670 align:start position:0%
ambulance transportation to an emergency
department

03:49:51.670 --> 03:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
department
 
03:49:54.170 --> 03:49:54.180 align:start position:0%
ACOG does not recommend this
 
03:49:57.110 --> 03:49:57.120 align:start position:0%
experimental practice stating that and I
 
03:49:59.210 --> 03:49:59.220 align:start position:0%
quote claims of medication abortion
 
03:50:01.729 --> 03:50:01.739 align:start position:0%
reversal are not supported by the body
 
03:50:04.190 --> 03:50:04.200 align:start position:0%
of scientific evidence and this approach
 
03:50:06.889 --> 03:50:06.899 align:start position:0%
is not recommended end quote
 
03:50:09.410 --> 03:50:09.420 align:start position:0%
mandating Health Care Providers to give
 
03:50:12.290 --> 03:50:12.300 align:start position:0%
patients information about an unproven
 
03:50:14.990 --> 03:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
and experimental therapy is a disturbing
 
03:50:17.570 --> 03:50:17.580 align:start position:0%
intrusion into the relationship between
 
03:50:20.570 --> 03:50:20.580 align:start position:0%
Physicians and their patients we should
 
03:50:22.309 --> 03:50:22.319 align:start position:0%
all be concerned when politicians
 
03:50:24.830 --> 03:50:24.840 align:start position:0%
recommend treatment options over the
 
03:50:26.210 --> 03:50:26.220 align:start position:0%
advice of medical profession
 
03:50:26.220 --> 03:50:27.769 align:start position:0%

many concerns about this bill including

the stigmatizing focus the potential
 
03:52:08.990 --> 03:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
burdens of mandating a waiting period
 
03:52:11.210 --> 03:52:11.220 align:start position:0%
the requirement that the Department of
 
03:52:12.950 --> 03:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services produced
 
03:52:15.229 --> 03:52:15.239 align:start position:0%
literature thus designed to reinforce

information by health care providers
 
03:52:23.330 --> 03:52:23.340 align:start position:0%

their patients
 
03:52:27.349 --> 03:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
I'd like to be clear that house bill 562
 
03:52:29.630 --> 03:52:29.640 align:start position:0%
does not introduce the concept of
 
03:52:32.090 --> 03:52:32.100 align:start position:0%
informed consent in abortion care
 
03:52:34.729 --> 03:52:34.739 align:start position:0%
medical ethics Board of Medicine and
 
03:52:36.650 --> 03:52:36.660 align:start position:0%
common standards of practice already
 
03:52:38.630 --> 03:52:38.640 align:start position:0%
require informed consent prior to
 
03:52:40.550 --> 03:52:40.560 align:start position:0%
abortion procedures whether they are
 
03:52:43.070 --> 03:52:43.080 align:start position:0%
medication abortions or procedurals or
 
03:52:44.929 --> 03:52:44.939 align:start position:0%
surgical abortions
 
03:52:47.090 --> 03:52:47.100 align:start position:0%
medically accurate patient-centered
 
03:52:49.910 --> 03:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
informed consent is already an essential
 
03:52:52.130 --> 03:52:52.140 align:start position:0%
element of delivering abortion care in
 
03:52:54.110 --> 03:52:54.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire including at the lovering
 
03:52:57.290 --> 03:52:57.300 align:start position:0%
health center House Bill 562 is an
 
03:52:59.450 --> 03:52:59.460 align:start position:0%
overreaching attempt to interfere with
 
03:53:01.370 --> 03:53:01.380 align:start position:0%
the delivery of accurate evidence-based
 
03:53:03.530 --> 03:53:03.540 align:start position:0%
abortion care
 
03:53:05.269 --> 03:53:05.279 align:start position:0%
so for those who may not know medication
 
03:53:06.950 --> 03:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
abortion is used for over half of the
 
03:53:08.450 --> 03:53:08.460 align:start position:0%
patients seeking abortion care in our
 
03:53:10.250 --> 03:53:10.260 align:start position:0%
country that's also true in New
 
03:53:12.410 --> 03:53:12.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire medication abortions are
 
03:53:14.510 --> 03:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
provided following safe effective
 
03:53:17.050 --> 03:53:17.060 align:start position:0%
protocols using one or two medications
 
03:53:19.750 --> 03:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
in the two medication protocol
 
03:53:22.790 --> 03:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
mifipristone is administered first the
 
03:53:25.490 --> 03:53:25.500 align:start position:0%
second medication misoprostol is taken 6
 
03:53:28.370 --> 03:53:28.380 align:start position:0%
to 24 hours following methopristone
 
03:53:30.530 --> 03:53:30.540 align:start position:0%
there is also an evidence-based
 
03:53:32.269 --> 03:53:32.279 align:start position:0%
guideline for the use of mesoprostol
 
03:53:32.279 --> 03:53:33.290 align:start position:0%
guideline for the use of mesoprostol
only

03:53:33.290 --> 03:53:33.300 align:start position:0%
only
 
03:53:35.330 --> 03:53:35.340 align:start position:0%
and though that involves time to
 
03:53:38.210 --> 03:53:38.220 align:start position:0%
multiple doses of misoprossal it's
 
03:53:39.410 --> 03:53:39.420 align:start position:0%
really critical for you to understand
 
03:53:41.990 --> 03:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
that it is accurate when we say there is
 
03:53:44.330 --> 03:53:44.340 align:start position:0%
no body of evidence to support the use
 
03:53:46.250 --> 03:53:46.260 align:start position:0%
of progesterone after the administration
 
03:53:47.929 --> 03:53:47.939 align:start position:0%
of mythopristone
 
03:53:51.729 --> 03:53:51.739 align:start position:0%
to affect the viability of a pregnancy
 
03:53:54.349 --> 03:53:54.359 align:start position:0%
after method Personnel Administration
 
03:53:57.590 --> 03:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
meaning there's no evidence that after a
 
03:53:59.330 --> 03:53:59.340 align:start position:0%
patient takes methopristone the first
 
03:54:01.550 --> 03:54:01.560 align:start position:0%
step in a medication abortion that
 
03:54:03.710 --> 03:54:03.720 align:start position:0%
supplemental progesterone adding
 
03:54:05.750 --> 03:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
progesterone to their body will impact
 
03:54:08.150 --> 03:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
the viability of a pregnancy if in fact
 
03:54:10.070 --> 03:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
it is continuing
 
03:54:11.690 --> 03:54:11.700 align:start position:0%
our bodies when they are pregnant
 
03:54:13.790 --> 03:54:13.800 align:start position:0%
naturally produce progesterone to
 
03:54:15.530 --> 03:54:15.540 align:start position:0%
support the pregnancy
 
03:54:17.809 --> 03:54:17.819 align:start position:0%
a patient seeking an abortion has
 
03:54:21.170 --> 03:54:21.180 align:start position:0%
adequate progesterone in their body
 
03:54:24.229 --> 03:54:24.239 align:start position:0%
to protect and grow that pregnancy if
 
03:54:26.150 --> 03:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
they didn't their pregnancy would not be
 
03:54:28.370 --> 03:54:28.380 align:start position:0%
viable at the time of the abortion I
 
03:54:30.349 --> 03:54:30.359 align:start position:0%
hope that makes sense to you the way
 
03:54:32.330 --> 03:54:32.340 align:start position:0%
that I'm explaining it
 
03:54:35.929 --> 03:54:35.939 align:start position:0%
so there is no evidence that if a
 
03:54:37.130 --> 03:54:37.140 align:start position:0%
patient remains pregnant after taking
 
03:54:39.410 --> 03:54:39.420 align:start position:0%
this from that misfa pristine that there
 
03:54:41.750 --> 03:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
is in fact an impact by adding
 
03:54:43.729 --> 03:54:43.739 align:start position:0%
progesterone in fact there's potential
 
03:54:45.950 --> 03:54:45.960 align:start position:0%
there for harm and the studies that have
 
03:54:47.990 --> 03:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
been done have demonstrated over and
 
03:54:50.809 --> 03:54:50.819 align:start position:0%
over that there is not enough evidence
 
03:54:53.030 --> 03:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
to support this recommendation all right
 
03:54:55.070 --> 03:54:55.080 align:start position:0%
so you're kind of over your time okay
 
03:54:58.550 --> 03:54:58.560 align:start position:0%
sum up please yes so I would like to say
 
03:55:00.590 --> 03:55:00.600 align:start position:0%
that the Levering Health Center if there
 
03:55:02.090 --> 03:55:02.100 align:start position:0%
are questions about informed consent in
 
03:55:03.290 --> 03:55:03.300 align:start position:0%
the process of delivering Health Center
 
03:55:05.030 --> 03:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
I would welcome the opportunity to
 
03:55:06.769 --> 03:55:06.779 align:start position:0%
address those thank you thank you
 
03:55:12.050 --> 03:55:12.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:13.910 --> 03:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
I guess thank you chair and thank you
 
03:55:15.710 --> 03:55:15.720 align:start position:0%
for your testimony you used the
 
03:55:18.229 --> 03:55:18.239 align:start position:0%
expression stigmatizing focus and I'm
 
03:55:19.969 --> 03:55:19.979 align:start position:0%
wondering what you mean by that
 
03:55:21.650 --> 03:55:21.660 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to speak to that thank you
 
03:55:24.290 --> 03:55:24.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:27.830 --> 03:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
I think there is an assumption that or I
 
03:55:30.229 --> 03:55:30.239 align:start position:0%
would say what I hear often is the
 
03:55:32.570 --> 03:55:32.580 align:start position:0%
assumption that the fact that we exist
 
03:55:34.729 --> 03:55:34.739 align:start position:0%
abortion providers and medical
 
03:55:36.170 --> 03:55:36.180 align:start position:0%
professionals providing abortion care
 
03:55:39.410 --> 03:55:39.420 align:start position:0%
exist and that patients call us already
 
03:55:41.330 --> 03:55:41.340 align:start position:0%
having decided that they may be seeking
 
03:55:43.490 --> 03:55:43.500 align:start position:0%
abortion care means that somehow we're
 
03:55:47.030 --> 03:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
coercing them into that decision which I
 
03:55:49.910 --> 03:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
find offensive honestly and I think it's
 
03:55:52.670 --> 03:55:52.680 align:start position:0%
stigmatizing to patients
 
03:55:55.150 --> 03:55:55.160 align:start position:0%
when they are presented with information
 
03:55:58.189 --> 03:55:58.199 align:start position:0%
that wholeheartedly reinforces the fact
 
03:56:02.210 --> 03:56:02.220 align:start position:0%
that they must or should consider
 
03:56:05.570 --> 03:56:05.580 align:start position:0%
information beyond the risks benefits
 
03:56:07.910 --> 03:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
and realistic medical guidance that we
 
03:56:10.910 --> 03:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
provide associated with abortion care so
 
03:56:13.729 --> 03:56:13.739 align:start position:0%
I'm speaking about mandating that we be
 
03:56:15.410 --> 03:56:15.420 align:start position:0%
directing patients to consider
 
03:56:17.750 --> 03:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
information about fetal development the
 
03:56:19.969 --> 03:56:19.979 align:start position:0%
size of a fetus the physical the wording
 
03:56:21.710 --> 03:56:21.720 align:start position:0%
in this bill the physical
 
03:56:23.990 --> 03:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
characteristics of the fetus etc etc
 
03:56:26.030 --> 03:56:26.040 align:start position:0%
that information is publicly available
 
03:56:29.389 --> 03:56:29.399 align:start position:0%
already anyone any patient who wanted to
 
03:56:31.070 --> 03:56:31.080 align:start position:0%
seek that information could find it
 
03:56:33.950 --> 03:56:33.960 align:start position:0%
publicly already and consider it and we
 
03:56:36.410 --> 03:56:36.420 align:start position:0%
would be happy to to
 
03:56:38.750 --> 03:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
provide references to those resources if
 
03:56:40.250 --> 03:56:40.260 align:start position:0%
that was the information a patient
 
03:56:40.260 --> 03:56:41.929 align:start position:0%
that was the information a patient
wanted

03:56:41.929 --> 03:56:41.939 align:start position:0%
wanted
 
03:56:45.229 --> 03:56:45.239 align:start position:0%
so I find it stigmatizing
 
03:56:48.530 --> 03:56:48.540 align:start position:0%
to imply that a patient is not informed
 
03:56:51.170 --> 03:56:51.180 align:start position:0%
when they come to our office unless they
 
03:56:53.750 --> 03:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
receive information that reflects
 
03:56:57.110 --> 03:56:57.120 align:start position:0%
information designed to reverse their
 
03:56:58.849 --> 03:56:58.859 align:start position:0%
decision or influence the reversal of a
 
03:57:00.769 --> 03:57:00.779 align:start position:0%
decision to have an abortion other
 
03:57:04.070 --> 03:57:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:08.330 --> 03:57:08.340 align:start position:0%
yes uh whoops uh representative Perez
 
03:57:10.550 --> 03:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:57:13.309 --> 03:57:13.319 align:start position:0%
I heard what Planned Parenthood does
 
03:57:16.729 --> 03:57:16.739 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to find out if I am an
 
03:57:18.710 --> 03:57:18.720 align:start position:0%
18 year old girl who finds myself
 
03:57:18.720 --> 03:57:20.630 align:start position:0%
18 year old girl who finds myself
pregnant

03:57:20.630 --> 03:57:20.640 align:start position:0%
pregnant
 
03:57:23.870 --> 03:57:23.880 align:start position:0%
um and I go online to make an
 
03:57:23.880 --> 03:57:26.090 align:start position:0%
um and I go online to make an
appointment

03:57:26.090 --> 03:57:26.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:28.130 --> 03:57:28.140 align:start position:0%
um is it a medical professional that's
 
03:57:30.290 --> 03:57:30.300 align:start position:0%
going to call me back before my
 
03:57:32.090 --> 03:57:32.100 align:start position:0%
appointment and say
 
03:57:35.150 --> 03:57:35.160 align:start position:0%
you know these are your options you can
 
03:57:37.370 --> 03:57:37.380 align:start position:0%
have a medical you can have a
 
03:57:40.309 --> 03:57:40.319 align:start position:0%
non-medical but there are other options
 
03:57:43.490 --> 03:57:43.500 align:start position:0%
out there if you decide to not have the
 
03:57:45.710 --> 03:57:45.720 align:start position:0%
abortion is that all done and is it a
 
03:57:48.490 --> 03:57:48.500 align:start position:0%
medical professional that is giving me
 
03:57:52.189 --> 03:57:52.199 align:start position:0%
that information prior to me walking in
 
03:57:54.710 --> 03:57:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:57.530 --> 03:57:57.540 align:start position:0%
uh yes so uh for the lovering health
 
03:57:57.540 --> 03:57:58.550 align:start position:0%
uh yes so uh for the lovering health
center

03:57:58.550 --> 03:57:58.560 align:start position:0%
center
 
03:58:00.229 --> 03:58:00.239 align:start position:0%
patients did not make appointments
 
03:58:02.210 --> 03:58:02.220 align:start position:0%
online they're always made directly in
 
03:58:04.010 --> 03:58:04.020 align:start position:0%
conversation with patients they're not
 
03:58:05.929 --> 03:58:05.939 align:start position:0%
ever made in conversation with a second
 
03:58:08.090 --> 03:58:08.100 align:start position:0%
party for instance a parent a partner
 
03:58:11.389 --> 03:58:11.399 align:start position:0%
anyone else so
 
03:58:13.490 --> 03:58:13.500 align:start position:0%
we have a process we have a mandatory
 
03:58:15.290 --> 03:58:15.300 align:start position:0%
education session for every single
 
03:58:17.389 --> 03:58:17.399 align:start position:0%
patient receiving abortion care prior to
 
03:58:19.910 --> 03:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
their abortion if a patient does not
 
03:58:22.010 --> 03:58:22.020 align:start position:0%
attend that or cannot attend that that
 
03:58:23.990 --> 03:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
would be the only circumstance where we
 
03:58:25.969 --> 03:58:25.979 align:start position:0%
would provide same-day education and
 
03:58:29.570 --> 03:58:29.580 align:start position:0%
abortion care we may our protocol is
 
03:58:32.330 --> 03:58:32.340 align:start position:0%
that we have a one hour session
 
03:58:34.309 --> 03:58:34.319 align:start position:0%
dedicated for every single abortion
 
03:58:37.250 --> 03:58:37.260 align:start position:0%
patient that we require them to attend
 
03:58:40.370 --> 03:58:40.380 align:start position:0%
by Telehealth or in person their choice
 
03:58:43.370 --> 03:58:43.380 align:start position:0%
where they receive extensive education
 
03:58:45.830 --> 03:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
about options
 
03:58:47.870 --> 03:58:47.880 align:start position:0%
an assessment with them about their
 
03:58:49.429 --> 03:58:49.439 align:start position:0%
Readiness to make the decision that
 
03:58:52.189 --> 03:58:52.199 align:start position:0%
they're making we confirm privately with
 
03:58:53.870 --> 03:58:53.880 align:start position:0%
them that they are not being coerced
 
03:58:56.510 --> 03:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
into making this decision by anybody or
 
03:58:59.030 --> 03:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
feeling coerced By Us in any way and
 
03:59:00.290 --> 03:59:00.300 align:start position:0%
then we provide all of the medical
 
03:59:02.030 --> 03:59:02.040 align:start position:0%
information about the procedure itself
 
03:59:05.570 --> 03:59:05.580 align:start position:0%
the risks the benefits and at the end of
 
03:59:07.309 --> 03:59:07.319 align:start position:0%
that there is a time frame the
 
03:59:08.870 --> 03:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
appointment for the abortion is not that
 
03:59:10.670 --> 03:59:10.680 align:start position:0%
same day typically
 
03:59:13.130 --> 03:59:13.140 align:start position:0%
so there is an opportunity for folks to
 
03:59:16.429 --> 03:59:16.439 align:start position:0%
reflect and change their minds and we
 
03:59:18.710 --> 03:59:18.720 align:start position:0%
confirm that and the language system the
 
03:59:20.689 --> 03:59:20.699 align:start position:0%
bill asks for it to be certified and I
 
03:59:22.130 --> 03:59:22.140 align:start position:0%
would say that every single abortion
 
03:59:23.750 --> 03:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
patient that comes to our Clinic has
 
03:59:26.750 --> 03:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
assigned informed consent in their
 
03:59:28.849 --> 03:59:28.859 align:start position:0%
medical record that includes all of the
 
03:59:30.650 --> 03:59:30.660 align:start position:0%
elements that I just discussed including
 
03:59:32.870 --> 03:59:32.880 align:start position:0%
coercion including risk benefits and
 
03:59:34.969 --> 03:59:34.979 align:start position:0%
safety and all of the elements of their
 
03:59:34.979 --> 03:59:36.130 align:start position:0%
safety and all of the elements of their
procedure

03:59:36.130 --> 03:59:36.140 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
03:59:39.889 --> 03:59:39.899 align:start position:0%
are there other options as well yes the
 
03:59:41.570 --> 03:59:41.580 align:start position:0%
first line of our consent form explains
 
03:59:43.429 --> 03:59:43.439 align:start position:0%
you have the right to make to continue
 
03:59:46.010 --> 03:59:46.020 align:start position:0%
your pregnancy and that if you choose to
 
03:59:47.809 --> 03:59:47.819 align:start position:0%
continue your pregnancy options are
 
03:59:50.750 --> 03:59:50.760 align:start position:0%
parenting or adoption Etc so that
 
03:59:52.969 --> 03:59:52.979 align:start position:0%
language is in our consent form other
 
03:59:55.790 --> 03:59:55.800 align:start position:0%
questions so this way representative
 
03:59:58.250 --> 03:59:58.260 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and
 
03:59:59.990 --> 04:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
I hope I'm not asking a question you
 
04:00:01.429 --> 04:00:01.439 align:start position:0%
can't answer but I'm sure you're in
 
04:00:04.610 --> 04:00:04.620 align:start position:0%
contact with your colleagues at similar
 
04:00:06.410 --> 04:00:06.420 align:start position:0%
Health Centers Nationwide
 
04:00:06.420 --> 04:00:07.070 align:start position:0%
Health Centers Nationwide
um

04:00:07.070 --> 04:00:07.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:09.410 --> 04:00:09.420 align:start position:0%
but one of the in uh
 
04:00:11.450 --> 04:00:11.460 align:start position:0%
back on the fourth page available on
 
04:00:13.670 --> 04:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
about a geographically indexed materials
 
04:00:16.969 --> 04:00:16.979 align:start position:0%
about the uh you know the options um
 
04:00:18.469 --> 04:00:18.479 align:start position:0%
they specifically mentioned adoption
 
04:00:20.030 --> 04:00:20.040 align:start position:0%
agencies but it should presumably
 
04:00:22.550 --> 04:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
include all the options so they include
 
04:00:24.590 --> 04:00:24.600 align:start position:0%
clinics such as yours which do provide
 
04:00:26.570 --> 04:00:26.580 align:start position:0%
services throughout pregnancy so you
 
04:00:28.370 --> 04:00:28.380 align:start position:0%
don't just provide a pregnancy but you
 
04:00:31.450 --> 04:00:31.460 align:start position:0%
also provide a Services you know for for
 
04:00:33.530 --> 04:00:33.540 align:start position:0%
women who are
 
04:00:35.809 --> 04:00:35.819 align:start position:0%
carrying their pregnancies to terms or
 
04:00:37.729 --> 04:00:37.739 align:start position:0%
you know if you're if they've been
 
04:00:39.950 --> 04:00:39.960 align:start position:0%
included or excluded from the so-called
 
04:00:42.530 --> 04:00:42.540 align:start position:0%
geographically indexed material which is
 
04:00:44.269 --> 04:00:44.279 align:start position:0%
presumably been made available in other
 
04:00:46.429 --> 04:00:46.439 align:start position:0%
states because this exact same bill has
 
04:00:48.290 --> 04:00:48.300 align:start position:0%
been introduced and even passed in some
 
04:00:50.210 --> 04:00:50.220 align:start position:0%
other states so even though the
 
04:00:51.710 --> 04:00:51.720 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor wasn't quite sure where it
 
04:00:54.290 --> 04:00:54.300 align:start position:0%
came from it's clearly a model legis
 
04:00:55.849 --> 04:00:55.859 align:start position:0%
bill that came from somewhere and it's
 
04:00:58.130 --> 04:00:58.140 align:start position:0%
being introduced Nationwide and thanks
 
04:01:00.650 --> 04:01:00.660 align:start position:0%
yeah it's my understanding is that this
 
04:01:02.389 --> 04:01:02.399 align:start position:0%
resource at the Department of Health and
 
04:01:04.250 --> 04:01:04.260 align:start position:0%
Human Services are on their website does
 
04:01:06.590 --> 04:01:06.600 align:start position:0%
not exist and this is mandatory increase
 
04:01:09.229 --> 04:01:09.239 align:start position:0%
uh this is mandating creation of that
 
04:01:11.570 --> 04:01:11.580 align:start position:0%
resource and my reading of the language
 
04:01:13.370 --> 04:01:13.380 align:start position:0%
of the bill is that it does not require
 
04:01:16.790 --> 04:01:16.800 align:start position:0%
that we be included in that resource I
 
04:01:18.170 --> 04:01:18.180 align:start position:0%
can't speak to what's happening in other
 
04:01:18.180 --> 04:01:19.610 align:start position:0%
can't speak to what's happening in other
states

04:01:19.610 --> 04:01:19.620 align:start position:0%
states
 
04:01:21.889 --> 04:01:21.899 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions for this
 
04:01:21.899 --> 04:01:23.450 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions for this
week

04:01:23.450 --> 04:01:23.460 align:start position:0%
week
 
04:01:27.889 --> 04:01:27.899 align:start position:0%
all right next I have uh Courtney Reed I
 
04:01:29.269 --> 04:01:29.279 align:start position:0%
hope I'm
 
04:01:34.189 --> 04:01:34.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:35.929 --> 04:01:35.939 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and members of the
 
04:01:38.269 --> 04:01:38.279 align:start position:0%
committee uh I'm here again today on
 
04:01:41.570 --> 04:01:41.580 align:start position:0%
behalf of the ACLU of New Hampshire to
 
04:01:44.090 --> 04:01:44.100 align:start position:0%
encourage committee members to oppose HB
 
04:01:47.689 --> 04:01:47.699 align:start position:0%
562 and Trust patients decisions
 
04:01:50.689 --> 04:01:50.699 align:start position:0%
HP 562 as we've heard in other testimony
 
04:01:53.210 --> 04:01:53.220 align:start position:0%
would require all patients seeking
 
04:01:55.849 --> 04:01:55.859 align:start position:0%
abortions to wait 24 hours before any
 
04:01:57.590 --> 04:01:57.600 align:start position:0%
medical intervention
 
04:02:00.050 --> 04:02:00.060 align:start position:0%
the proposed legislation also contains
 
04:02:01.969 --> 04:02:01.979 align:start position:0%
misinformation regarding medication
 
04:02:04.790 --> 04:02:04.800 align:start position:0%
abortion and shames patients by making
 
04:02:06.769 --> 04:02:06.779 align:start position:0%
assumptions about their decision-making
 
04:02:06.779 --> 04:02:08.389 align:start position:0%
assumptions about their decision-making
capabilities

04:02:08.389 --> 04:02:08.399 align:start position:0%
capabilities
 
04:02:10.070 --> 04:02:10.080 align:start position:0%
I'll start by noting that waiting
 
04:02:11.929 --> 04:02:11.939 align:start position:0%
periods prevent individuals from
 
04:02:14.330 --> 04:02:14.340 align:start position:0%
obtaining abortions it adds an
 
04:02:17.150 --> 04:02:17.160 align:start position:0%
unnecessary barrier for patients for no
 
04:02:19.790 --> 04:02:19.800 align:start position:0%
reason based in science or medicine
 
04:02:22.610 --> 04:02:22.620 align:start position:0%
moreover forcing patients to attend
 
04:02:25.130 --> 04:02:25.140 align:start position:0%
multiple appointments bring added costs
 
04:02:27.769 --> 04:02:27.779 align:start position:0%
Beyond just an initial co-pay or the
 
04:02:30.170 --> 04:02:30.180 align:start position:0%
cost of an abortion patients will need
 
04:02:32.330 --> 04:02:32.340 align:start position:0%
to arrange to take extra time off work
 
04:02:34.670 --> 04:02:34.680 align:start position:0%
potentially jeopardizing jobs they can't
 
04:02:36.889 --> 04:02:36.899 align:start position:0%
afford to lose find additional child
 
04:02:39.170 --> 04:02:39.180 align:start position:0%
care and scrape together money for
 
04:02:41.929 --> 04:02:41.939 align:start position:0%
travel and lodging costs generated by
 
04:02:44.870 --> 04:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
the mandatory delay and any difficulties
 
04:02:47.150 --> 04:02:47.160 align:start position:0%
in scheduling a second appointment May
 
04:02:49.070 --> 04:02:49.080 align:start position:0%
push an abortion out later into
 
04:02:49.080 --> 04:02:50.570 align:start position:0%
push an abortion out later into
pregnancy

04:02:50.570 --> 04:02:50.580 align:start position:0%
pregnancy
 
04:02:52.790 --> 04:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
as such mandated delays have
 
04:02:55.250 --> 04:02:55.260 align:start position:0%
demonstrated to increase medical risks
 
04:02:57.710 --> 04:02:57.720 align:start position:0%
many of the patients who don't manage to
 
04:02:59.990 --> 04:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
overcome obstacles imposed by mandatory
 
04:03:02.210 --> 04:03:02.220 align:start position:0%
delay laws are forced to seek later
 
04:03:05.450 --> 04:03:05.460 align:start position:0%
abortions for example a waiting period
 
04:03:07.790 --> 04:03:07.800 align:start position:0%
that was installed in Mississippi showed
 
04:03:09.110 --> 04:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
that the proportion of abortions
 
04:03:11.170 --> 04:03:11.180 align:start position:0%
performed after the first trimester
 
04:03:14.870 --> 04:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
increased by 39 percent
 
04:03:17.990 --> 04:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
medical groups like The ACOG stand in
 
04:03:19.969 --> 04:03:19.979 align:start position:0%
opposition to waiting periods for this
 
04:03:19.979 --> 04:03:21.469 align:start position:0%
opposition to waiting periods for this
reason

04:03:21.469 --> 04:03:21.479 align:start position:0%
reason
 
04:03:23.330 --> 04:03:23.340 align:start position:0%
moreover mandatory delays
 
04:03:25.969 --> 04:03:25.979 align:start position:0%
disproportionately hurt minors for many
 
04:03:27.650 --> 04:03:27.660 align:start position:0%
reasons young people tend to have
 
04:03:29.689 --> 04:03:29.699 align:start position:0%
abortions later than adults many
 
04:03:31.429 --> 04:03:31.439 align:start position:0%
teenagers have irregular menstrual
 
04:03:34.070 --> 04:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
cycles and take longer to recognize the
 
04:03:35.570 --> 04:03:35.580 align:start position:0%
signs of pregnancy
 
04:03:37.790 --> 04:03:37.800 align:start position:0%
we should not add another barrier to
 
04:03:40.729 --> 04:03:40.739 align:start position:0%
their ability to access abortion
 
04:03:42.650 --> 04:03:42.660 align:start position:0%
mandated delays to mean pregnant
 
04:03:42.660 --> 04:03:43.969 align:start position:0%
mandated delays to mean pregnant
individuals

04:03:43.969 --> 04:03:43.979 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
04:03:46.849 --> 04:03:46.859 align:start position:0%
mandated delays for abortions imply that
 
04:03:48.590 --> 04:03:48.600 align:start position:0%
patients who are seeking this procedure
 
04:03:50.990 --> 04:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
or medication abortion and should do so
 
04:03:53.090 --> 04:03:53.100 align:start position:0%
have done so without an adequate
 
04:03:55.550 --> 04:03:55.560 align:start position:0%
reflection and are incapable of making
 
04:03:57.889 --> 04:03:57.899 align:start position:0%
reasoned moral decisions regarding their
 
04:04:00.290 --> 04:04:00.300 align:start position:0%
health and their future
 
04:04:02.929 --> 04:04:02.939 align:start position:0%
to be transparent it's cruel to tell
 
04:04:05.689 --> 04:04:05.699 align:start position:0%
victims of rape or incest are those with
 
04:04:08.450 --> 04:04:08.460 align:start position:0%
fetuses incompatible with life that they
 
04:04:11.570 --> 04:04:11.580 align:start position:0%
need 24 hours to reconsider
 
04:04:13.910 --> 04:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
there are no other regulations for other
 
04:04:16.969 --> 04:04:16.979 align:start position:0%
procedures like this mandatory waiting
 
04:04:16.979 --> 04:04:18.229 align:start position:0%
procedures like this mandatory waiting
period

04:04:18.229 --> 04:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
period
 
04:04:20.150 --> 04:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
and I'll just finish by noting that a
 
04:04:22.370 --> 04:04:22.380 align:start position:0%
vast majority of granite Staters support
 
04:04:24.290 --> 04:04:24.300 align:start position:0%
safe and legal abortion
 
04:04:26.809 --> 04:04:26.819 align:start position:0%
72 percent of gold Granite stators
 
04:04:30.170 --> 04:04:30.180 align:start position:0%
identified as being pro-choice in 2022
 
04:04:31.849 --> 04:04:31.859 align:start position:0%
and so as this polling makes clear
 
04:04:34.189 --> 04:04:34.199 align:start position:0%
Granite Staters don't appreciate acts of
 
04:04:35.870 --> 04:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
government overreach and intervention
 
04:04:37.729 --> 04:04:37.739 align:start position:0%
into their private Health Care decisions
 
04:04:39.889 --> 04:04:39.899 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to urge the committee to
 
04:04:41.990 --> 04:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
vote itl on this Bill thank you
 
04:04:45.469 --> 04:04:45.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:47.030 --> 04:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
representative Greece
 
04:04:48.469 --> 04:04:48.479 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:04:50.809 --> 04:04:50.819 align:start position:0%
your testimony I know the Acoustics in
 
04:04:52.729 --> 04:04:52.739 align:start position:0%
this room are are bad but I was pretty
 
04:04:55.370 --> 04:04:55.380 align:start position:0%
certain I just heard recently that
 
04:04:57.410 --> 04:04:57.420 align:start position:0%
abortion providers typically do not
 
04:05:00.110 --> 04:05:00.120 align:start position:0%
provide same-day procedures that they'll
 
04:05:01.969 --> 04:05:01.979 align:start position:0%
have a an appointment and they'll have
 
04:05:04.309 --> 04:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
it might even be Telehealth uh where
 
04:05:05.870 --> 04:05:05.880 align:start position:0%
they can go through and explain the
 
04:05:06.830 --> 04:05:06.840 align:start position:0%
procedures and all that kind of stuff
 
04:05:08.330 --> 04:05:08.340 align:start position:0%
and then they'll have an appointment
 
04:05:10.330 --> 04:05:10.340 align:start position:0%
that would come in so are they not then
 
04:05:12.950 --> 04:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
themselves a barrier to access to
 
04:05:16.670 --> 04:05:16.680 align:start position:0%
abortions that the 24-hour uh waiting
 
04:05:19.790 --> 04:05:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:22.610 --> 04:05:22.620 align:start position:0%
really already happening anyway that
 
04:05:24.469 --> 04:05:24.479 align:start position:0%
you're not actually adding any
 
04:05:27.110 --> 04:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
additional time to what is already in
 
04:05:27.120 --> 04:05:28.790 align:start position:0%
additional time to what is already in
place

04:05:28.790 --> 04:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
place
 
04:05:31.010 --> 04:05:31.020 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for your question I don't
 
04:05:32.750 --> 04:05:32.760 align:start position:0%
want to speak on behalf of the medical
 
04:05:34.790 --> 04:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
community but
 
04:05:37.490 --> 04:05:37.500 align:start position:0%
um as I've said uh associations like the
 
04:05:42.410 --> 04:05:42.420 align:start position:0%
ecog have encouraged uh eliminating
 
04:05:44.689 --> 04:05:44.699 align:start position:0%
barriers to access to timely and safe
 
04:05:47.030 --> 04:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
abortions and so I'll just leave with
 
04:05:49.070 --> 04:05:49.080 align:start position:0%
that remark all right other questions to
 
04:05:51.110 --> 04:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
this Witness
 
04:05:53.929 --> 04:05:53.939 align:start position:0%
yes representative Perez yes you stated
 
04:05:56.330 --> 04:05:56.340 align:start position:0%
72 of
 
04:05:56.340 --> 04:05:57.250 align:start position:0%
72 of
um

04:05:57.250 --> 04:05:57.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:00.170 --> 04:06:00.180 align:start position:0%
individuals in New Hampshire are
 
04:06:02.030 --> 04:06:02.040 align:start position:0%
pro-choice can you just tell me where
 
04:06:03.650 --> 04:06:03.660 align:start position:0%
you got that where you obtained that
 
04:06:06.469 --> 04:06:06.479 align:start position:0%
information from uh yeah that is from
 
04:06:09.889 --> 04:06:09.899 align:start position:0%
the Saint Anselm uh polling
 
04:06:11.630 --> 04:06:11.640 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that Saint
 
04:06:13.849 --> 04:06:13.859 align:start position:0%
Anselm's polling was not if they were
 
04:06:18.769 --> 04:06:18.779 align:start position:0%
pro-choice but if they were in favor of
 
04:06:22.250 --> 04:06:22.260 align:start position:0%
either pro-choice or
 
04:06:25.790 --> 04:06:25.800 align:start position:0%
in favor of our present fetal Life
 
04:06:28.670 --> 04:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
protection act so um it's my
 
04:06:31.429 --> 04:06:31.439 align:start position:0%
understanding that it's not necessarily
 
04:06:34.610 --> 04:06:34.620 align:start position:0%
that they are pro-choice
 
04:06:36.710 --> 04:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
uh could I respond to that
 
04:06:38.809 --> 04:06:38.819 align:start position:0%
I would think from my understanding
 
04:06:41.450 --> 04:06:41.460 align:start position:0%
looking at the polling there are a
 
04:06:44.210 --> 04:06:44.220 align:start position:0%
several different prompts that uh the
 
04:06:46.550 --> 04:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
respondents answered and I believe
 
04:06:48.050 --> 04:06:48.060 align:start position:0%
that's one of them but I can send you
 
04:06:49.370 --> 04:06:49.380 align:start position:0%
what I was looking at
 
04:06:51.229 --> 04:06:51.239 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions for this
 
04:06:51.239 --> 04:06:53.150 align:start position:0%

York 40 years ago and never looked back
 
04:07:58.130 --> 04:07:58.140 align:start position:0%
I love my state
 
04:08:04.969 --> 04:08:04.979 align:start position:0%
I am here to oppose House Bill 6 562.
 
04:08:08.450 --> 04:08:08.460 align:start position:0%
and I will explain why my mother had
 
04:08:09.710 --> 04:08:09.720 align:start position:0%
four daughters
 
04:08:13.250 --> 04:08:13.260 align:start position:0%
my sister Deirdre 18 months later she
 
04:08:14.870 --> 04:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
gave birth to me
 
04:08:17.450 --> 04:08:17.460 align:start position:0%
and seven years later she gave birth to
 
04:08:19.490 --> 04:08:19.500 align:start position:0%
my twin sisters
 
04:08:22.250 --> 04:08:22.260 align:start position:0%
my father was an alcoholic and a wife
 
04:08:24.769 --> 04:08:24.779 align:start position:0%
abuser and he was also a travel and
 
04:08:24.779 --> 04:08:26.510 align:start position:0%
abuser and he was also a travel and
salesman

04:08:26.510 --> 04:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
salesman
 
04:08:29.450 --> 04:08:29.460 align:start position:0%
three months after the Twins were born
 
04:08:32.450 --> 04:08:32.460 align:start position:0%
my mother discovered that my father
 
04:08:34.610 --> 04:08:34.620 align:start position:0%
married other woman while he was
 
04:08:38.030 --> 04:08:38.040 align:start position:0%
traveling and at their birth he was a
 
04:08:40.070 --> 04:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
three-time bigamist
 
04:08:42.650 --> 04:08:42.660 align:start position:0%
at that point the few years after that
 
04:08:45.229 --> 04:08:45.239 align:start position:0%
we found ourselves on welfare
 
04:08:48.110 --> 04:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
we were homeless at one point and living
 
04:08:50.450 --> 04:08:50.460 align:start position:0%
in the projects
 
04:08:53.630 --> 04:08:53.640 align:start position:0%
mom remarried when I was 11. she married
 
04:08:55.969 --> 04:08:55.979 align:start position:0%
a New York City fireman
 
04:08:58.070 --> 04:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
and he had a shield
 
04:09:01.010 --> 04:09:01.020 align:start position:0%
in New York firemen and policemen do not
 
04:09:03.410 --> 04:09:03.420 align:start position:0%
call their badges badges they called
 
04:09:05.870 --> 04:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
them Shields and there is a reason for
 
04:09:05.880 --> 04:09:09.590 align:start position:0%
them Shields and there is a reason for
that

04:09:09.590 --> 04:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:13.490 --> 04:09:13.500 align:start position:0%
I do not say his name I refer to him at
 
04:09:18.710 --> 04:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:20.809 --> 04:09:20.819 align:start position:0%
he bought us a house
 
04:09:24.710 --> 04:09:24.720 align:start position:0%
and he moved the five of us into a home
 
04:09:27.590 --> 04:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
all of my other family aunts and uncles
 
04:09:30.170 --> 04:09:30.180 align:start position:0%
thought what a wonderful man marrying my
 
04:09:33.050 --> 04:09:33.060 align:start position:0%
mother and taking on her four daughters
 
04:09:35.030 --> 04:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
the four of us spent the rest of our
 
04:09:39.830 --> 04:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
childhoods being raped beaten
 
04:09:39.840 --> 04:09:41.450 align:start position:0%
childhoods being raped beaten
mentally

04:09:41.450 --> 04:09:41.460 align:start position:0%
mentally
 
04:09:41.460 --> 04:09:43.030 align:start position:0%
mentally
spiritually

04:09:43.030 --> 04:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
spiritually
 
04:09:45.650 --> 04:09:45.660 align:start position:0%
intellectually abused
 
04:09:49.670 --> 04:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:54.469 --> 04:09:54.479 align:start position:0%
and on occasion we would call the police
 
04:09:56.990 --> 04:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
but he had a shield
 
04:10:00.349 --> 04:10:00.359 align:start position:0%
and so we never had any safety
 
04:10:04.010 --> 04:10:04.020 align:start position:0%
my sister Deirdre died from suicide this
 
04:10:05.929 --> 04:10:05.939 align:start position:0%
past July
 
04:10:08.389 --> 04:10:08.399 align:start position:0%
she was a brilliant woman
 
04:10:10.309 --> 04:10:10.319 align:start position:0%
who raised three brilliant children
 
04:10:13.070 --> 04:10:13.080 align:start position:0%
while she was raising them she managed
 
04:10:15.889 --> 04:10:15.899 align:start position:0%
to go to Fordham University and get her
 
04:10:19.969 --> 04:10:19.979 align:start position:0%
MSW with a 4.0 average
 
04:10:22.070 --> 04:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
her children are Rhodes Scholars
 
04:10:24.349 --> 04:10:24.359 align:start position:0%
Fulbright Scholars London School of
 
04:10:27.229 --> 04:10:27.239 align:start position:0%
Business but she is gone
 
04:10:31.490 --> 04:10:31.500 align:start position:0%
she started having memory issues at 62.
 
04:10:33.710 --> 04:10:33.720 align:start position:0%
it turned out diatra had multiple
 
04:10:36.710 --> 04:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
traumatic brain injuries
 
04:10:39.229 --> 04:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
and the dementia was wrapped I'm you're
 
04:10:41.750 --> 04:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
kind of over your time and I and I okay
 
04:10:45.410 --> 04:10:45.420 align:start position:0%
so I'm gonna say that the reason why I
 
04:10:47.809 --> 04:10:47.819 align:start position:0%
lived in fear when I found out I was
 
04:10:51.410 --> 04:10:51.420 align:start position:0%
pregnant at 16 I told my sister Deirdre
 
04:10:54.469 --> 04:10:54.479 align:start position:0%
I was two weeks late
 
04:10:56.750 --> 04:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
when I was finally able to get an
 
04:10:58.969 --> 04:10:58.979 align:start position:0%
abortion in New York it was before Roe v
 
04:10:58.979 --> 04:11:00.110 align:start position:0%
abortion in New York it was before Roe v
Wade

04:11:00.110 --> 04:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
Wade
 
04:11:02.689 --> 04:11:02.699 align:start position:0%
I was 10 weeks pregnant
 
04:11:05.450 --> 04:11:05.460 align:start position:0%
during that period there is nobody in
 
04:11:07.490 --> 04:11:07.500 align:start position:0%
this room who could imagine the fear
 
04:11:10.670 --> 04:11:10.680 align:start position:0%
that I lived in because that man would
 
04:11:14.570 --> 04:11:14.580 align:start position:0%
have beat me to death
 
04:11:17.809 --> 04:11:17.819 align:start position:0%
and I am not exaggerating the only
 
04:11:21.170 --> 04:11:21.180 align:start position:0%
reason I am here the only reason I have
 
04:11:23.809 --> 04:11:23.819 align:start position:0%
a beautiful young woman the only reason
 
04:11:26.450 --> 04:11:26.460 align:start position:0%
I have one sister left
 
04:11:30.950 --> 04:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
is because I had an abortion at 16. I
 
04:11:35.389 --> 04:11:35.399 align:start position:0%
had bodily autonomy and it saved my life
 
04:11:35.399 --> 04:11:37.370 align:start position:0%
had bodily autonomy and it saved my life
literally

04:11:37.370 --> 04:11:37.380 align:start position:0%
literally
 
04:11:39.650 --> 04:11:39.660 align:start position:0%

04:12:29.750 --> 04:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
according to the Journal of uh an
 
04:12:30.889 --> 04:12:30.899 align:start position:0%
article published in the Journal of
 
04:12:34.490 --> 04:12:34.500 align:start position:0%
Americans uh Physicians and surgeons
 
04:12:36.469 --> 04:12:36.479 align:start position:0%
it was found that nearly three quarters
 
04:12:38.090 --> 04:12:38.100 align:start position:0%
of women with the history of abortion
 
04:12:40.790 --> 04:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
surveyed surveyed
 
04:12:43.130 --> 04:12:43.140 align:start position:0%
uh felt pressure to terminate their
 
04:12:43.140 --> 04:12:44.630 align:start position:0%
uh felt pressure to terminate their
pregnancies

04:12:44.630 --> 04:12:44.640 align:start position:0%
pregnancies
 
04:12:47.090 --> 04:12:47.100 align:start position:0%
in that same survey about 60 percent
 
04:12:49.370 --> 04:12:49.380 align:start position:0%
decided to abort in order to make others
 
04:12:49.380 --> 04:12:51.650 align:start position:0%
decided to abort in order to make others
happy

04:12:51.650 --> 04:12:51.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:53.570 --> 04:12:53.580 align:start position:0%
so I have the question to ask you guys
 
04:12:55.670 --> 04:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
here if you're a pro-choice
 
04:12:59.750 --> 04:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
don't you want the mother to have uh all
 
04:13:01.490 --> 04:13:01.500 align:start position:0%
the information she needs to make her
 
04:13:01.500 --> 04:13:02.809 align:start position:0%
the information she needs to make her
choice

04:13:02.809 --> 04:13:02.819 align:start position:0%
choice
 
04:13:05.330 --> 04:13:05.340 align:start position:0%
that's all that this bill would do
 
04:13:07.250 --> 04:13:07.260 align:start position:0%
uh this this bill would give the mother
 
04:13:09.950 --> 04:13:09.960 align:start position:0%
information on Services if she does in
 
04:13:11.269 --> 04:13:11.279 align:start position:0%
case she doesn't know about them that
 
04:13:12.769 --> 04:13:12.779 align:start position:0%
she could obtain
 
04:13:14.809 --> 04:13:14.819 align:start position:0%
it would be based on the latest science
 
04:13:16.250 --> 04:13:16.260 align:start position:0%
and developed by our Department of
 
04:13:18.410 --> 04:13:18.420 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services and it would
 
04:13:20.210 --> 04:13:20.220 align:start position:0%
give patients access to the most
 
04:13:22.490 --> 04:13:22.500 align:start position:0%
possible info and give them a little bit
 
04:13:24.769 --> 04:13:24.779 align:start position:0%
of time to think about it before uh
 
04:13:26.330 --> 04:13:26.340 align:start position:0%
doing this and and I know that there are
 
04:13:28.370 --> 04:13:28.380 align:start position:0%
Ministries out there that help women to
 
04:13:30.290 --> 04:13:30.300 align:start position:0%
heal from past abortions there's many
 
04:13:32.689 --> 04:13:32.699 align:start position:0%
who regret it and this would give people
 
04:13:36.050 --> 04:13:36.060 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to reflect on that and
 
04:13:37.490 --> 04:13:37.500 align:start position:0%
that's my testimony thank you Mr chair
 
04:13:41.630 --> 04:13:41.640 align:start position:0%
thank you uh questions for this Witness
 
04:13:43.429 --> 04:13:43.439 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much sir and
 
04:13:43.439 --> 04:13:44.389 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much sir and
I

04:13:44.389 --> 04:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:13:49.250 --> 04:13:49.260 align:start position:0%
well yes no I know uh Miss Woods uh you
 
04:13:50.929 --> 04:13:50.939 align:start position:0%
I know you have a card and then so
 
04:13:52.849 --> 04:13:52.859 align:start position:0%
please we want to hear from you
 
04:13:55.250 --> 04:13:55.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and my apologies for
 
04:13:56.990 --> 04:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
being out of the room at the time he
 
04:13:58.610 --> 04:13:58.620 align:start position:0%
called my name
 
04:14:01.910 --> 04:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
my name is Phyllis woods from Dover and
 
04:14:03.950 --> 04:14:03.960 align:start position:0%
again we're looking at one of those
 
04:14:06.889 --> 04:14:06.899 align:start position:0%
perennial bills that has been to my
 
04:14:08.570 --> 04:14:08.580 align:start position:0%
knowledge at least over the last 20
 
04:14:10.309 --> 04:14:10.319 align:start position:0%
years that we have been trying to get
 
04:14:13.309 --> 04:14:13.319 align:start position:0%
through but a lot has changed
 
04:14:17.689 --> 04:14:17.699 align:start position:0%
we all see ads today on TV for drugs
 
04:14:20.689 --> 04:14:20.699 align:start position:0%
that after stating the benefits they
 
04:14:23.030 --> 04:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
talk about a list of potential side
 
04:14:25.790 --> 04:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
effects and risks that make it seem very
 
04:14:28.429 --> 04:14:28.439 align:start position:0%
dangerous to take the drugs if we really
 
04:14:30.710 --> 04:14:30.720 align:start position:0%
care about women why would we want to
 
04:14:33.969 --> 04:14:33.979 align:start position:0%
deny someone facing an unplanned or
 
04:14:36.650 --> 04:14:36.660 align:start position:0%
unexpected pregnancy who is
 
04:14:39.170 --> 04:14:39.180 align:start position:0%
contemplating taking the chemical
 
04:14:42.110 --> 04:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
abortion pill full disclosure and
 
04:14:44.809 --> 04:14:44.819 align:start position:0%
information on the extent of the
 
04:14:47.450 --> 04:14:47.460 align:start position:0%
expected possible side effects of these
 
04:14:50.630 --> 04:14:50.640 align:start position:0%
drugs do we not want to empower women to
 
04:14:53.030 --> 04:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
make informed Decisions by providing
 
04:14:54.830 --> 04:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
them with critical information and
 
04:14:57.170 --> 04:14:57.180 align:start position:0%
knowledge so they can make wise and
 
04:14:59.210 --> 04:14:59.220 align:start position:0%
prudent decisions regarding their
 
04:15:01.550 --> 04:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
pregnancy now we know there are a lot of
 
04:15:04.189 --> 04:15:04.199 align:start position:0%
side effects of taking the abortion pill
 
04:15:08.030 --> 04:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
of the chemical abortion pill and
 
04:15:10.849 --> 04:15:10.859 align:start position:0%
recently of four National medical
 
04:15:13.450 --> 04:15:13.460 align:start position:0%
associations and four doctors
 
04:15:15.650 --> 04:15:15.660 align:start position:0%
experiencing caring for pregnant and
 
04:15:18.769 --> 04:15:18.779 align:start position:0%
post-abortion women have filed a brief
 
04:15:21.530 --> 04:15:21.540 align:start position:0%
in federal court that pushes back on the
 
04:15:23.929 --> 04:15:23.939 align:start position:0%
Food and Drug administration's arguments
 
04:15:26.630 --> 04:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
against withdrawing or suspending its
 
04:15:29.630 --> 04:15:29.640 align:start position:0%
approval of chemical abortion drugs that
 
04:15:32.389 --> 04:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
harm women and girls by illegally
 
04:15:35.689 --> 04:15:35.699 align:start position:0%
approving dangerous chemical abortion
 
04:15:38.450 --> 04:15:38.460 align:start position:0%
drugs the FDA Port women and girls In
 
04:15:42.650 --> 04:15:42.660 align:start position:0%
Harm's Way and these doctors represent
 
04:15:45.650 --> 04:15:45.660 align:start position:0%
those who are seeking to protect women
 
04:15:48.110 --> 04:15:48.120 align:start position:0%
from the documented dangers of chemical
 
04:15:51.349 --> 04:15:51.359 align:start position:0%
abortions we know that
 
04:15:51.359 --> 04:15:51.950 align:start position:0%
abortions we know that
um

04:15:51.950 --> 04:15:51.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:55.189 --> 04:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
we've heard several cases where there
 
04:15:56.769 --> 04:15:56.779 align:start position:0%
have been
 
04:16:00.410 --> 04:16:00.420 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences not only
 
04:16:03.050 --> 04:16:03.060 align:start position:0%
physical but even to death we've heard
 
04:16:06.469 --> 04:16:06.479 align:start position:0%
of a 19 year old in Canada who died of
 
04:16:09.590 --> 04:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
septic shock after thing is we do have
 
04:16:12.650 --> 04:16:12.660 align:start position:0%
this abortion reversal pill and if women
 
04:16:14.510 --> 04:16:14.520 align:start position:0%
could know about that they could Avail
 
04:16:16.910 --> 04:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
themselves there have been documented
 
04:16:20.570 --> 04:16:20.580 align:start position:0%
for 4 000 plus babies that have actually
 
04:16:23.689 --> 04:16:23.699 align:start position:0%
been born after one took the abortion
 
04:16:26.570 --> 04:16:26.580 align:start position:0%
reversal pill after taking the first
 
04:16:26.580 --> 04:16:27.769 align:start position:0%
reversal pill after taking the first
pill

04:16:27.769 --> 04:16:27.779 align:start position:0%
pill
 
04:16:32.090 --> 04:16:32.100 align:start position:0%
so there is a potential there for women
 
04:16:35.689 --> 04:16:35.699 align:start position:0%
to be able to change their mind one of
 
04:16:38.809 --> 04:16:38.819 align:start position:0%
the women that I spoke to recently just
 
04:16:42.530 --> 04:16:42.540 align:start position:0%
left being on the abortion reversal pill
 
04:16:45.710 --> 04:16:45.720 align:start position:0%
hotline where she's worked for several
 
04:16:47.870 --> 04:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
years and has talked to hundreds of
 
04:16:51.650 --> 04:16:51.660 align:start position:0%
women thousands and actually just as
 
04:16:54.889 --> 04:16:54.899 align:start position:0%
some babies we've heard this morning do
 
04:16:57.889 --> 04:16:57.899 align:start position:0%
survive on surgical abortion there have
 
04:17:00.110 --> 04:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
been at least a couple of documented
 
04:17:02.929 --> 04:17:02.939 align:start position:0%
cases where after taking both the first
 
04:17:05.510 --> 04:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
and second chemical abortion pill the
 
04:17:07.910 --> 04:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
babies did survive and went on to live
 
04:17:11.510 --> 04:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
healthy lives so please support this
 
04:17:14.590 --> 04:17:14.600 align:start position:0%
bill and just give necessary and
 
04:17:18.229 --> 04:17:18.239 align:start position:0%
available information to women on what
 
04:17:20.330 --> 04:17:20.340 align:start position:0%
the potential side effects are of these
 
04:17:22.370 --> 04:17:22.380 align:start position:0%
drugs thank you Mr chair thank you
 
04:17:26.210 --> 04:17:26.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:28.610 --> 04:17:28.620 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you all right is there
 
04:17:31.130 --> 04:17:31.140 align:start position:0%
anyone else who wishes to testify on on
 
04:17:36.530 --> 04:17:36.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:38.630 --> 04:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm Brian Lewis from
 
04:17:41.689 --> 04:17:41.699 align:start position:0%
Alexandria speaking on my own behalf
 
04:17:44.750 --> 04:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
an earlier speaker one of the Bill's
 
04:17:46.910 --> 04:17:46.920 align:start position:0%
sponsors was asked if he knew of any
 
04:17:50.030 --> 04:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
other surgical procedures that required
 
04:17:53.630 --> 04:17:53.640 align:start position:0%
24-hour informed consent and he did not
 
04:17:56.750 --> 04:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
and I gave the topic some thought
 
04:17:59.389 --> 04:17:59.399 align:start position:0%
and I don't either on the other hand I
 
04:18:00.590 --> 04:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
don't know of any other surgical
 
04:18:02.450 --> 04:18:02.460 align:start position:0%
procedures that are intended to
 
04:18:04.250 --> 04:18:04.260 align:start position:0%
terminate life
 
04:18:06.050 --> 04:18:06.060 align:start position:0%
given that this is so radically
 
04:18:08.590 --> 04:18:08.600 align:start position:0%
different I don't think that 24-hour
 
04:18:11.809 --> 04:18:11.819 align:start position:0%
Advanced consent is such an onerous
 
04:18:14.150 --> 04:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
thing I support the bill all right
 
04:18:17.229 --> 04:18:17.239 align:start position:0%
questions for this Witness
 
04:18:19.370 --> 04:18:19.380 align:start position:0%
thank you very much anyone else who
 
04:18:23.150 --> 04:18:23.160 align:start position:0%

yes

audited multiple contract research
 
04:18:56.750 --> 04:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
organizations to understand whether
 
04:18:59.210 --> 04:18:59.220 align:start position:0%
these companies are meeting compliance
 
04:19:01.429 --> 04:19:01.439 align:start position:0%
requirements for informed consent and
 
04:19:03.650 --> 04:19:03.660 align:start position:0%
that's the topic to which I wish to wish
 
04:19:06.110 --> 04:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
to speak briefly today
 
04:19:08.929 --> 04:19:08.939 align:start position:0%
scores are hundreds of clinical trials
 
04:19:11.450 --> 04:19:11.460 align:start position:0%
are ongoing to study the safety and
 
04:19:14.269 --> 04:19:14.279 align:start position:0%
efficacy of pharmaceuticals biological
 
04:19:16.969 --> 04:19:16.979 align:start position:0%
products and medical devices almost all
 
04:19:19.070 --> 04:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
of these Studies have an initial
 
04:19:21.410 --> 04:19:21.420 align:start position:0%
screening visit during which inclusion
 
04:19:25.189 --> 04:19:25.199 align:start position:0%
and exclusion criteria are explored and
 
04:19:27.050 --> 04:19:27.060 align:start position:0%
typically the informed process consent
 
04:19:29.929 --> 04:19:29.939 align:start position:0%
process is begun for those passing this
 
04:19:31.849 --> 04:19:31.859 align:start position:0%
screening step
 
04:19:34.429 --> 04:19:34.439 align:start position:0%
the informed consent process is often
 
04:19:37.370 --> 04:19:37.380 align:start position:0%
repeated in subsequent visits as ongoing
 
04:19:40.250 --> 04:19:40.260 align:start position:0%
cumulative study data is updated and to
 
04:19:42.830 --> 04:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
confirm that the patient understands the
 
04:19:46.010 --> 04:19:46.020 align:start position:0%
current risk benefit ratio so I say all
 
04:19:47.809 --> 04:19:47.819 align:start position:0%
this to provide to the committee the
 
04:19:50.870 --> 04:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
fact that 24-hour informed consent has
 
04:19:53.510 --> 04:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
substantial precedent
 
04:19:55.670 --> 04:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
in hundreds and hundreds of clinical
 
04:19:57.830 --> 04:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
trials for
 
04:20:00.229 --> 04:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
decades ever since the good clinical
 
04:20:03.290 --> 04:20:03.300 align:start position:0%
practices were implemented by the FDA
 
04:20:05.389 --> 04:20:05.399 align:start position:0%
and other agencies
 
04:20:08.929 --> 04:20:08.939 align:start position:0%
so it has substantial precedent that is
 
04:20:11.510 --> 04:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
the focus of my testimony today thank
 
04:20:16.429 --> 04:20:16.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:18.710 --> 04:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much is there
 
04:20:20.870 --> 04:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
anyone else who wishes to testify on
 
04:20:25.150 --> 04:20:25.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:27.229 --> 04:20:27.239 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'm going to close the
 
04:20:30.710 --> 04:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
hearing on how to build 562. and given
 
04:20:34.790 --> 04:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
the hour and the fact that uh some of my
 
04:20:37.309 --> 04:20:37.319 align:start position:0%
colleagues have wisely uh taken the
 
04:20:39.650 --> 04:20:39.660 align:start position:0%
lunch recess and I'm going to do that
 
04:20:41.630 --> 04:20:41.640 align:start position:0%
myself now but I'm going to open the
 
04:20:44.990 --> 04:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 591
 
04:20:47.269 --> 04:20:47.279 align:start position:0%
prohibiting abortion after detection of
 
04:20:50.210 --> 04:20:50.220 align:start position:0%
fetal heartbeat and I'm going to ask my
 
04:20:51.830 --> 04:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
colleague representative Wallace if he
 
04:20:53.450 --> 04:20:53.460 align:start position:0%
will uh
 
04:20:55.550 --> 04:20:55.560 align:start position:0%
chair the hearing while for the brief
 
04:20:56.750 --> 04:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
period of time that I'm going to do one
 
04:21:01.130 --> 04:21:01.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:04.969 --> 04:21:04.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:07.550 --> 04:21:07.560 align:start position:0%
the floor is yours
 
04:21:10.130 --> 04:21:10.140 align:start position:0%
thank you uh I'm not even sure what time
 
04:21:13.189 --> 04:21:13.199 align:start position:0%
it is anymore uh
 
04:21:16.309 --> 04:21:16.319 align:start position:0%
I come to you with a bill fairly simple
 
04:21:16.319 --> 04:21:18.610 align:start position:0%
I come to you with a bill fairly simple
uh

04:21:18.610 --> 04:21:18.620 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:21:18.620 --> 04:21:20.150 align:start position:0%
uh
591.

04:21:20.150 --> 04:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
591.
 
04:21:23.809 --> 04:21:23.819 align:start position:0%
last year there was a bill that got
 
04:21:26.630 --> 04:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
itself all bound up together it finally
 
04:21:28.729 --> 04:21:28.739 align:start position:0%
passed it had to do with whether or not
 
04:21:31.870 --> 04:21:31.880 align:start position:0%
we needed a a
 
04:21:35.090 --> 04:21:35.100 align:start position:0%
ultrasound in the case to determine is
 
04:21:38.650 --> 04:21:38.660 align:start position:0%
it 24 weeks is it 24 what whatever
 
04:21:41.689 --> 04:21:41.699 align:start position:0%
and it it caused a lot of problems and
 
04:21:43.910 --> 04:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
even today in the last couple of days
 
04:21:46.729 --> 04:21:46.739 align:start position:0%
you can hear some discussions on it that
 
04:21:51.290 --> 04:21:51.300 align:start position:0%
yeah if a ultrasound
 
04:21:54.769 --> 04:21:54.779 align:start position:0%
causes a lot of concern on some people's
 
04:21:54.779 --> 04:21:56.510 align:start position:0%
causes a lot of concern on some people's
cases

04:21:56.510 --> 04:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
cases
 
04:22:01.070 --> 04:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
I I thought about it and uh during the
 
04:22:02.750 --> 04:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
off session
 
04:22:05.389 --> 04:22:05.399 align:start position:0%
and I decided I was going to enter a
 
04:22:08.929 --> 04:22:08.939 align:start position:0%
bill that maybe would simplify things it
 
04:22:10.610 --> 04:22:10.620 align:start position:0%
basically says
 
04:22:12.830 --> 04:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
if you can hear the heartbeat
 
04:22:14.769 --> 04:22:14.779 align:start position:0%
that's enough
 
04:22:18.349 --> 04:22:18.359 align:start position:0%
a person with a stethoscope that's got
 
04:22:20.090 --> 04:22:20.100 align:start position:0%
it wired no need to worry about whether
 
04:22:22.729 --> 04:22:22.739 align:start position:0%
it's a big an ultrasound machine or
 
04:22:25.729 --> 04:22:25.739 align:start position:0%
whatever it is so that's all this bill
 
04:22:28.550 --> 04:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
does is say the same thing as the one
 
04:22:32.030 --> 04:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
previously had said that if you if you
 
04:22:33.889 --> 04:22:33.899 align:start position:0%
want to have an abortion
 
04:22:37.370 --> 04:22:37.380 align:start position:0%
and you can't hear the heartbeat
 
04:22:38.630 --> 04:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
04:22:41.090 --> 04:22:41.100 align:start position:0%
if you can hear the heartbeat you have
 
04:22:43.370 --> 04:22:43.380 align:start position:0%
to have you have to have some other
 
04:22:46.030 --> 04:22:46.040 align:start position:0%
procedures it's a fairly simple bill
 
04:22:49.490 --> 04:22:49.500 align:start position:0%
there's all sorts of yeah it takes a
 
04:22:52.130 --> 04:22:52.140 align:start position:0%
page in half to say what essentially I
 
04:22:55.309 --> 04:22:55.319 align:start position:0%
just said uh now
 
04:22:57.410 --> 04:22:57.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:22:59.210 --> 04:22:59.220 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions for
 
04:23:03.290 --> 04:23:03.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:05.809 --> 04:23:05.819 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you good
 
04:23:15.229 --> 04:23:15.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:17.150 --> 04:23:17.160 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon thank you chair thank
 
04:23:18.530 --> 04:23:18.540 align:start position:0%
you committee members for hearing me out
 
04:23:20.269 --> 04:23:20.279 align:start position:0%
again uh representative marcelo's
 
04:23:23.450 --> 04:23:23.460 align:start position:0%
Grafton 18. uh this is the hot beat bill
 
04:23:29.330 --> 04:23:29.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:35.450 --> 04:23:35.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:37.969 --> 04:23:37.979 align:start position:0%
I you could take you know right here you
 
04:23:39.349 --> 04:23:39.359 align:start position:0%
can just
 
04:23:40.969 --> 04:23:40.979 align:start position:0%
put your hand on your heart
 
04:23:43.010 --> 04:23:43.020 align:start position:0%
just put you in your yard
 
04:23:45.349 --> 04:23:45.359 align:start position:0%
if you're beating you're physically
 
04:23:45.359 --> 04:23:46.849 align:start position:0%
if you're beating you're physically
alive

04:23:46.849 --> 04:23:46.859 align:start position:0%
alive
 
04:23:48.889 --> 04:23:48.899 align:start position:0%
all right and that's all I think this
 
04:23:52.250 --> 04:23:52.260 align:start position:0%
Bill is saying that that infant within
 
04:23:54.710 --> 04:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
the womb is physically alive
 
04:23:56.450 --> 04:23:56.460 align:start position:0%
all right and I use the word infant
 
04:23:59.630 --> 04:23:59.640 align:start position:0%
because again I said that yesterday in
 
04:24:03.229 --> 04:24:03.239 align:start position:0%
Latin means in fan infan which means
 
04:24:05.929 --> 04:24:05.939 align:start position:0%
speechless uh one that's not able to
 
04:24:05.939 --> 04:24:06.950 align:start position:0%
speechless uh one that's not able to
speak

04:24:06.950 --> 04:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
speak
 
04:24:10.849 --> 04:24:10.859 align:start position:0%
and that's exactly what an infant is
 
04:24:15.290 --> 04:24:15.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:18.050 --> 04:24:18.060 align:start position:0%
physically comes out of the woman
 
04:24:20.809 --> 04:24:20.819 align:start position:0%
so it's still in the womb it's an infant
 
04:24:23.150 --> 04:24:23.160 align:start position:0%
you can call it anything you want but I
 
04:24:25.670 --> 04:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
think we're just lying to ourselves and
 
04:24:27.830 --> 04:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
do you need to stop realizing the
 
04:24:29.510 --> 04:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
deception that's been going on and it's
 
04:24:31.429 --> 04:24:31.439 align:start position:0%
been going on for a lot of years and it
 
04:24:33.769 --> 04:24:33.779 align:start position:0%
needs to stop
 
04:24:33.779 --> 04:24:35.750 align:start position:0%
needs to stop
now

04:24:35.750 --> 04:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:24:37.910 --> 04:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
like a lot of men around here that have
 
04:24:37.920 --> 04:24:39.070 align:start position:0%
like a lot of men around here that have
wives

04:24:39.070 --> 04:24:39.080 align:start position:0%
wives
 
04:24:42.830 --> 04:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
I can't tell my wife what to do and if I
 
04:24:46.070 --> 04:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
do she she'll just look at me and walk
 
04:24:50.389 --> 04:24:50.399 align:start position:0%
away anyways my point is no woman wants
 
04:24:53.269 --> 04:24:53.279 align:start position:0%
to be told what to do and I agree as a
 
04:24:54.710 --> 04:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
guy I don't want to be told what to do
 
04:24:57.349 --> 04:24:57.359 align:start position:0%
we just went through a pandemic there a
 
04:24:59.750 --> 04:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
pain down here and we were all told what
 
04:25:01.670 --> 04:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
to do you know you know we're a mess
 
04:25:03.769 --> 04:25:03.779 align:start position:0%
don't wear a mask go out can't go out
 
04:25:06.469 --> 04:25:06.479 align:start position:0%
shop you can't go out I don't think any
 
04:25:07.790 --> 04:25:07.800 align:start position:0%
one of us liked it
 
04:25:09.650 --> 04:25:09.660 align:start position:0%
but Society
 
04:25:11.510 --> 04:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
we have to look at that when it comes to
 
04:25:14.870 --> 04:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
the woman in abortion in a fetal
 
04:25:14.880 --> 04:25:17.150 align:start position:0%
the woman in abortion in a fetal
heartbeat

04:25:17.150 --> 04:25:17.160 align:start position:0%
heartbeat
 
04:25:19.670 --> 04:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
just for an example we don't really know
 
04:25:22.849 --> 04:25:22.859 align:start position:0%
the numbers of how many
 
04:25:25.010 --> 04:25:25.020 align:start position:0%
abortions we do in New Hampshire
 
04:25:27.229 --> 04:25:27.239 align:start position:0%
but the estimate that I had gotten
 
04:25:28.990 --> 04:25:29.000 align:start position:0%
online of course it's online
 
04:25:31.550 --> 04:25:31.560 align:start position:0%
everything's online this day
 
04:25:33.530 --> 04:25:33.540 align:start position:0%
is I'm assuming they're actually taking
 
04:25:35.990 --> 04:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
the numbers from other states and saying
 
04:25:38.149 --> 04:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
dividing that by how many abortions they
 
04:25:40.070 --> 04:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
do and look at the number of people we
 
04:25:41.929 --> 04:25:41.939 align:start position:0%
have here in New Hampshire and they're
 
04:25:43.910 --> 04:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
coming up with a number which I said
 
04:25:46.670 --> 04:25:46.680 align:start position:0%
yesterday was about 2200.
 
04:25:48.710 --> 04:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
2200 a year let's just use that number
 
04:25:50.809 --> 04:25:50.819 align:start position:0%
for a second
 
04:25:54.229 --> 04:25:54.239 align:start position:0%
10 years 22 000.
 
04:25:58.309 --> 04:25:58.319 align:start position:0%
20 years 44 000. and I'd say forty four
 
04:26:01.309 --> 04:26:01.319 align:start position:0%
thousand plus because by that time
 
04:26:06.170 --> 04:26:06.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:10.910 --> 04:26:10.920 align:start position:0%
we're destroying our next generation
 
04:26:14.210 --> 04:26:14.220 align:start position:0%
where we wonder why we don't have any
 
04:26:16.309 --> 04:26:16.319 align:start position:0%
students or our student population is
 
04:26:16.319 --> 04:26:17.689 align:start position:0%
students or our student population is
declining

04:26:17.689 --> 04:26:17.699 align:start position:0%
declining
 
04:26:20.389 --> 04:26:20.399 align:start position:0%
is this one of the reasons why we have
 
04:26:22.189 --> 04:26:22.199 align:start position:0%
to ask ourselves really is it one of the
 
04:26:24.530 --> 04:26:24.540 align:start position:0%
reasons why would our student population
 
04:26:27.469 --> 04:26:27.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:30.110 --> 04:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
by allowing the devotion Yeah by
 
04:26:32.090 --> 04:26:32.100 align:start position:0%
allowing abortions beyond the fetal
 
04:26:32.100 --> 04:26:33.530 align:start position:0%
allowing abortions beyond the fetal
heartbeat

04:26:33.530 --> 04:26:33.540 align:start position:0%
heartbeat
 
04:26:35.809 --> 04:26:35.819 align:start position:0%
we're also destroying our next great
 
04:26:38.149 --> 04:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
leaders our next great inventors
 
04:26:42.590 --> 04:26:42.600 align:start position:0%

04:26:53.510 --> 04:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
I mean think about it the list goes on
 
04:26:55.510 --> 04:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
and on
 
04:26:58.910 --> 04:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
we need to put
 
04:27:00.950 --> 04:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
we need to come to reality and realize
 
04:27:00.960 --> 04:27:02.030 align:start position:0%
we need to come to reality and realize
that

04:27:02.030 --> 04:27:02.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:27:04.070 --> 04:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
we got to stop doing this and I think at
 
04:27:06.530 --> 04:27:06.540 align:start position:0%
a fetal heartbeat you know when that
 
04:27:08.630 --> 04:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
baby's heart starts beating
 
04:27:11.030 --> 04:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's more than alive at that point
 
04:27:14.510 --> 04:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
it's actually formed it's it's it's not
 
04:27:17.510 --> 04:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
a blob it's not a fetus it's not embryo
 
04:27:19.969 --> 04:27:19.979 align:start position:0%
it's it's actually you know at that
 
04:27:19.979 --> 04:27:20.630 align:start position:0%
it's it's actually you know at that
point

04:27:20.630 --> 04:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
point
 
04:27:23.870 --> 04:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
an infant I wear on my collar here right
 
04:27:26.149 --> 04:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
here is the footprints or the actual
 
04:27:28.130 --> 04:27:28.140 align:start position:0%
feet not Footprints this is the actual
 
04:27:31.370 --> 04:27:31.380 align:start position:0%
feet of a 10 week old baby
 
04:27:34.490 --> 04:27:34.500 align:start position:0%
all right at that point 10 weeks and I
 
04:27:36.110 --> 04:27:36.120 align:start position:0%
think you've all maybe you've all might
 
04:27:37.429 --> 04:27:37.439 align:start position:0%
have seen it
 
04:27:39.469 --> 04:27:39.479 align:start position:0%
the actual it's it's about the size of
 
04:27:41.269 --> 04:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
my thumb when it's about 10 weeks the
 
04:27:44.570 --> 04:27:44.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:47.030 --> 04:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
I think we all inherently know when Life
 
04:27:49.250 --> 04:27:49.260 align:start position:0%
Starts I think sometimes we just want to
 
04:27:57.110 --> 04:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:58.729 --> 04:27:58.739 align:start position:0%
I would think
 
04:28:02.030 --> 04:28:02.040 align:start position:0%
the mother would gladly give up her
 
04:28:02.040 --> 04:28:04.309 align:start position:0%
the mother would gladly give up her
choice

04:28:04.309 --> 04:28:04.319 align:start position:0%
choice
 
04:28:06.889 --> 04:28:06.899 align:start position:0%
to an abortion to protect her infant's
 
04:28:06.899 --> 04:28:09.710 align:start position:0%
to an abortion to protect her infant's
life

04:28:09.710 --> 04:28:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:14.630 --> 04:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
again I support HB 591
 
04:28:16.790 --> 04:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
and I hope that the when this goes
 
04:28:16.800 --> 04:28:18.349 align:start position:0%
and I hope that the when this goes
forward

04:28:18.349 --> 04:28:18.359 align:start position:0%
forward
 
04:28:20.450 --> 04:28:20.460 align:start position:0%
the Senate and the governor would
 
04:28:23.269 --> 04:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
actually support it as well
 
04:28:25.189 --> 04:28:25.199 align:start position:0%
and I just want to let you I just want
 
04:28:27.290 --> 04:28:27.300 align:start position:0%
to say for you all here this this
 
04:28:29.090 --> 04:28:29.100 align:start position:0%
committee it starts with you guys and it
 
04:28:30.590 --> 04:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
starts with all of us out here as well
 
04:28:32.870 --> 04:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
but it starts with you because you're
 
04:28:35.149 --> 04:28:35.159 align:start position:0%
the ones that will take the vote up and
 
04:28:37.670 --> 04:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
pass us on to the floor
 
04:28:40.689 --> 04:28:40.699 align:start position:0%
and just think of it it'll be your names
 
04:28:43.490 --> 04:28:43.500 align:start position:0%
someplace will be etched in history
 
04:28:46.309 --> 04:28:46.319 align:start position:0%
either yay or nay on this bill
 
04:28:48.590 --> 04:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
so I hope that you would do the right
 
04:28:48.600 --> 04:28:50.090 align:start position:0%
so I hope that you would do the right
thing

04:28:50.090 --> 04:28:50.100 align:start position:0%
thing
 
04:28:53.450 --> 04:28:53.460 align:start position:0%
and realize life begins at the heartbeat
 
04:28:55.250 --> 04:28:55.260 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to read one Bible verse
 
04:28:58.429 --> 04:28:58.439 align:start position:0%
and then I'm finished
 
04:29:03.649 --> 04:29:03.659 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:06.889 --> 04:29:06.899 align:start position:0%
it says For You O God created my inner
 
04:29:10.189 --> 04:29:10.199 align:start position:0%
being you knitted you knit me together
 
04:29:12.170 --> 04:29:12.180 align:start position:0%
in my mother's womb
 
04:29:15.110 --> 04:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
I praise you because I am faithfully and
 
04:29:16.429 --> 04:29:16.439 align:start position:0%

04:29:19.490 --> 04:29:19.500 align:start position:0%
your works are wonderful I know that
 
04:29:20.809 --> 04:29:20.819 align:start position:0%

your eyes saw my unformed body
 
04:29:26.330 --> 04:29:26.340 align:start position:0%
unformed body
 
04:29:28.210 --> 04:29:28.220 align:start position:0%
all the days
 
04:29:31.370 --> 04:29:31.380 align:start position:0%
ordained for me were written in your
 
04:29:34.729 --> 04:29:34.739 align:start position:0%
book before one of them came to be
 
04:29:37.250 --> 04:29:37.260 align:start position:0%
God knows who we are before we came to
 
04:29:39.530 --> 04:29:39.540 align:start position:0%
be this is written
 
04:29:43.130 --> 04:29:43.140 align:start position:0%
almost 3 000 years ago are we going to
 
04:29:44.809 --> 04:29:44.819 align:start position:0%
believe the stuff we're hearing the last
 
04:29:46.910 --> 04:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
couple hundred years or less are we
 
04:29:47.809 --> 04:29:47.819 align:start position:0%
going to believe something that's
 
04:29:50.689 --> 04:29:50.699 align:start position:0%
written three thousand years ago thank
 
04:29:50.699 --> 04:29:52.729 align:start position:0%
written three thousand years ago thank
you

04:29:52.729 --> 04:29:52.739 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:29:56.330 --> 04:29:56.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:59.090 --> 04:29:59.100 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for taking my
 
04:29:59.100 --> 04:29:59.809 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for taking my
question

04:29:59.809 --> 04:29:59.819 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:30:02.030 --> 04:30:02.040 align:start position:0%
uh please speak up in the mic so I can
 
04:30:04.610 --> 04:30:04.620 align:start position:0%
hear thank you oh you can't hear me oh
 
04:30:06.950 --> 04:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
it's my ears it's not you it's me all
 
04:30:10.189 --> 04:30:10.199 align:start position:0%
right sorry uh do you have any idea or
 
04:30:13.969 --> 04:30:13.979 align:start position:0%
uh uh when the fetal heartbeat first
 
04:30:13.979 --> 04:30:16.269 align:start position:0%
uh uh when the fetal heartbeat first
occurs

04:30:16.269 --> 04:30:16.279 align:start position:0%
occurs
 
04:30:20.809 --> 04:30:20.819 align:start position:0%
say that again do you have any idea of
 
04:30:24.769 --> 04:30:24.779 align:start position:0%
when a fetal heartbeat first occurs so
 
04:30:26.689 --> 04:30:26.699 align:start position:0%
my understanding it is around it is
 
04:30:28.729 --> 04:30:28.739 align:start position:0%
around six weeks somewhere it could be
 
04:30:30.530 --> 04:30:30.540 align:start position:0%
six seven eight weeks maybe up to ten
 
04:30:30.540 --> 04:30:35.510 align:start position:0%
six seven eight weeks maybe up to ten
yes

04:30:35.510 --> 04:30:35.520 align:start position:0%

engage in the politics of abortion and
 
04:31:22.429 --> 04:31:22.439 align:start position:0%
influence key elections to restrict and
 
04:31:25.130 --> 04:31:25.140 align:start position:0%
abolish abortion state by state
 
04:31:26.689 --> 04:31:26.699 align:start position:0%

04:31:32.990 --> 04:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
our time

04:31:39.590 --> 04:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
children born and pre-born
 
04:31:41.990 --> 04:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
I come before this committee today as a
 
04:31:43.969 --> 04:31:43.979 align:start position:0%
woman of New Hampshire to urge you to
 
04:31:47.389 --> 04:31:47.399 align:start position:0%
support HB 591 the common sense bill
 
04:31:49.670 --> 04:31:49.680 align:start position:0%
that takes early action to protect
 
04:31:51.769 --> 04:31:51.779 align:start position:0%
pre-born babies once a heartbeat is
 
04:31:51.779 --> 04:31:53.689 align:start position:0%
pre-born babies once a heartbeat is
detected

04:31:53.689 --> 04:31:53.699 align:start position:0%
detected
 
04:31:56.090 --> 04:31:56.100 align:start position:0%
in a life or death setting a sign of
 
04:31:57.769 --> 04:31:57.779 align:start position:0%
life that your medical professionals
 
04:32:00.410 --> 04:32:00.420 align:start position:0%
look for is a heartbeat
 
04:32:02.570 --> 04:32:02.580 align:start position:0%
whether on the battlefield or in the
 
04:32:05.510 --> 04:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
emergency room that standard applies
 
04:32:08.210 --> 04:32:08.220 align:start position:0%
and yet with such undeniable assurance
 
04:32:10.790 --> 04:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
that they are in fact alive pre-born
 
04:32:12.530 --> 04:32:12.540 align:start position:0%
children in New Hampshire face death
 
04:32:12.540 --> 04:32:14.210 align:start position:0%
children in New Hampshire face death
daily

04:32:14.210 --> 04:32:14.220 align:start position:0%
daily
 
04:32:16.250 --> 04:32:16.260 align:start position:0%
our current model fails and that it
 
04:32:18.410 --> 04:32:18.420 align:start position:0%
allows the same people who would profit
 
04:32:20.450 --> 04:32:20.460 align:start position:0%
off of the death of a child in the womb
 
04:32:22.610 --> 04:32:22.620 align:start position:0%
to counsel a pregnant woman on whether
 
04:32:25.370 --> 04:32:25.380 align:start position:0%
she should get an abortion
 
04:32:27.830 --> 04:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
in such a delicate moment this allows
 
04:32:30.050 --> 04:32:30.060 align:start position:0%
for a predatory abortion industry to
 
04:32:32.510 --> 04:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
disregard her needs in favor of its own
 
04:32:35.090 --> 04:32:35.100 align:start position:0%
Financial gains
 
04:32:37.309 --> 04:32:37.319 align:start position:0%
this is a conflict of interest that
 
04:32:39.170 --> 04:32:39.180 align:start position:0%
serves a billion Dollar corporate entity
 
04:32:42.229 --> 04:32:42.239 align:start position:0%
and abandons women in a moment of need
 
04:32:44.030 --> 04:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
a majority of women who have had
 
04:32:46.670 --> 04:32:46.680 align:start position:0%
abortions in the United States have said
 
04:32:48.830 --> 04:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
that they felt coerced into getting an
 
04:32:48.840 --> 04:32:50.990 align:start position:0%
that they felt coerced into getting an
abortion

04:32:50.990 --> 04:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
abortion
 
04:32:54.649 --> 04:32:54.659 align:start position:0%
more access to abortion is not what my
 
04:32:57.290 --> 04:32:57.300 align:start position:0%
generation demands students for Life
 
04:33:00.410 --> 04:33:00.420 align:start position:0%
actions new polling found that less than
 
04:33:02.990 --> 04:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
two out of 10 Millennials want unlimited
 
04:33:05.209 --> 04:33:05.219 align:start position:0%
abortion through all nine months and
 
04:33:07.369 --> 04:33:07.379 align:start position:0%
nearly half supported limits on abortion
 
04:33:09.830 --> 04:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
after a heartbeat is detected
 
04:33:13.910 --> 04:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
by a margin of 47 to 38 percent
 
04:33:16.369 --> 04:33:16.379 align:start position:0%
our poll also found that 6 and 10
 
04:33:19.189 --> 04:33:19.199 align:start position:0%
supported requiring doctors to check for
 
04:33:22.551 --> 04:33:22.561 align:start position:0%
heartbeat before committing an abortion
 
04:33:24.529 --> 04:33:24.539 align:start position:0%
we've been collecting signatures on our
 
04:33:26.269 --> 04:33:26.279 align:start position:0%
digital petition and support for this
 
04:33:28.730 --> 04:33:28.740 align:start position:0%
life-saving legislation and as a person
 
04:33:31.789 --> 04:33:31.799 align:start position:0%
who stands for life I ask you today to
 
04:33:34.970 --> 04:33:34.980 align:start position:0%
support HP 591 because women deserve
 
04:33:37.010 --> 04:33:37.020 align:start position:0%
better than abortion and the voiceless
 
04:33:39.289 --> 04:33:39.299 align:start position:0%
victim in every abortion deserves our
 
04:33:42.109 --> 04:33:42.119 align:start position:0%
protection New Hampshire can and must do
 
04:33:44.510 --> 04:33:44.520 align:start position:0%
better to protect its women and children

04:37:21.109 --> 04:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
there has been almost a universal

the committee to review my apologies
 
04:38:50.990 --> 04:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
that I didn't hand that out earlier once
 
04:38:53.090 --> 04:38:53.100 align:start position:0%
again I'm here on behalf of the American
 
04:38:54.970 --> 04:38:54.980 align:start position:0%
civil liberties Union
 
04:38:58.010 --> 04:38:58.020 align:start position:0%
to encourage the committee to oppose HB
 
04:39:01.849 --> 04:39:01.859 align:start position:0%
591 and prevent obscene government
 
04:39:04.609 --> 04:39:04.619 align:start position:0%
overreach into Granite seder's Private

health care decisions
 
04:39:09.349 --> 04:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
HP 591 would prohibit abortions after
 
04:39:11.689 --> 04:39:11.699 align:start position:0%
any embryonic cardiac activity is
 
04:39:14.150 --> 04:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
detected which is usually at around six
 
04:39:14.160 --> 04:39:15.289 align:start position:0%
detected which is usually at around six
weeks

04:39:15.289 --> 04:39:15.299 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
04:39:17.689 --> 04:39:17.699 align:start position:0%
exemptions include medical procedures
 
04:39:20.090 --> 04:39:20.100 align:start position:0%
intended to prevent death or serious
 
04:39:22.070 --> 04:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
risk of substantial and irreversible
 
04:39:25.849 --> 04:39:25.859 align:start position:0%
impairment of a major bodily function
 
04:39:28.310 --> 04:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
for performing such an abortion outside
 
04:39:30.109 --> 04:39:30.119 align:start position:0%
of these extreme guidelines a physician
 
04:39:31.490 --> 04:39:31.500 align:start position:0%
might be subject to loss of their
 
04:39:33.769 --> 04:39:33.779 align:start position:0%
medical license or fines of up to three
 
04:39:35.330 --> 04:39:35.340 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
04:39:38.690 --> 04:39:38.700 align:start position:0%
HP 591 would ban almost all new
 
04:39:41.390 --> 04:39:41.400 align:start position:0%
abortions in New Hampshire
 
04:39:43.310 --> 04:39:43.320 align:start position:0%
this bill would prohibit abortions as
 
04:39:45.650 --> 04:39:45.660 align:start position:0%
early as six weeks into pregnancy before
 
04:39:47.330 --> 04:39:47.340 align:start position:0%
most people even know they are pregnant
 
04:39:50.208 --> 04:39:50.218 align:start position:0%
or have a health care decision to make
 
04:39:52.610 --> 04:39:52.620 align:start position:0%
with the existing barriers we face this
 
04:39:54.650 --> 04:39:54.660 align:start position:0%
bill would amount to a near total ban on
 
04:39:56.270 --> 04:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
abortion for most people in New
 
04:39:56.280 --> 04:39:57.650 align:start position:0%
abortion for most people in New
Hampshire

04:39:57.650 --> 04:39:57.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:39:59.750 --> 04:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
this legislation places both medical
 
04:40:01.910 --> 04:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
providers and their patients at risk
 
04:40:04.490 --> 04:40:04.500 align:start position:0%
because when there is no clear Universal
 
04:40:06.530 --> 04:40:06.540 align:start position:0%
definition of the point at which a
 
04:40:08.090 --> 04:40:08.100 align:start position:0%
pregnant person's life becomes
 
04:40:10.490 --> 04:40:10.500 align:start position:0%
endangered even when a physician is
 
04:40:12.410 --> 04:40:12.420 align:start position:0%
certain that an abortion or another
 
04:40:14.690 --> 04:40:14.700 align:start position:0%
medical Intervention which might pose a
 
04:40:16.850 --> 04:40:16.860 align:start position:0%
threat to pregnancy is in the best
 
04:40:19.190 --> 04:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
interest of the patient the risk of
 
04:40:21.650 --> 04:40:21.660 align:start position:0%
prosecution will incentivize him waiting
 
04:40:23.208 --> 04:40:23.218 align:start position:0%
to act until the patient's symptoms
 
04:40:25.970 --> 04:40:25.980 align:start position:0%
become demonstrably life-threatening
 
04:40:28.010 --> 04:40:28.020 align:start position:0%
the threat of a professional discipline
 
04:40:29.750 --> 04:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
directly conflicts with a doctor's
 
04:40:32.208 --> 04:40:32.218 align:start position:0%
ability to effectively treat a patient
 
04:40:34.368 --> 04:40:34.378 align:start position:0%
needing Medical Care
 
04:40:36.230 --> 04:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of grandstaters
 
04:40:38.690 --> 04:40:38.700 align:start position:0%
support safe and legal abortion
 
04:40:40.670 --> 04:40:40.680 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to conclude by noting that
 
04:40:42.230 --> 04:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire legislature should
 
04:40:44.208 --> 04:40:44.218 align:start position:0%
rather focus on the pressing Health
 
04:40:46.610 --> 04:40:46.620 align:start position:0%
needs of granite Staters
 
04:40:48.470 --> 04:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
recent data has shown that New Hampshire
 
04:40:50.150 --> 04:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
ranks last out of its New England
 
04:40:52.610 --> 04:40:52.620 align:start position:0%
counterparts in the overall quality of
 
04:40:54.470 --> 04:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
Health Care measured through cost
 
04:40:57.288 --> 04:40:57.298 align:start position:0%
accessibility and health outcomes
 
04:40:59.090 --> 04:40:59.100 align:start position:0%
further Research indicates that if

rise by 24 percent
 
04:41:07.610 --> 04:41:07.620 align:start position:0%
legislators should recognize the

devastating impact of abortion bans on
 
04:41:11.990 --> 04:41:12.000 align:start position:0%

uh so for the record again I'm Sandra de

non-core I'm a registered nurse and the
 
04:41:52.190 --> 04:41:52.200 align:start position:0%
executive director at the lovering
 
04:41:53.990 --> 04:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
health center in Greenland
 
04:41:56.270 --> 04:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
um I'll keep my testimony very short I
 
04:41:58.310 --> 04:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
did submit it in writing out in the
 
04:41:58.320 --> 04:41:59.570 align:start position:0%
did submit it in writing out in the
lobby

04:41:59.570 --> 04:41:59.580 align:start position:0%
lobby
 
04:42:01.190 --> 04:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
um we have 42 years of experience
 
04:42:02.868 --> 04:42:02.878 align:start position:0%
providing high quality health care that
 
04:42:05.050 --> 04:42:05.060 align:start position:0%
includes abortion care
 
04:42:07.670 --> 04:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
591 is Extreme and is out of touch with
 
04:42:09.830 --> 04:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
the majority of granite seders houseboat
 
04:42:12.230 --> 04:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
591 introduces a near total abortion ban
 
04:42:14.150 --> 04:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
presents significantly equal questions
 
04:42:15.890 --> 04:42:15.900 align:start position:0%
about the ability of medical providers
 
04:42:17.330 --> 04:42:17.340 align:start position:0%
to care for pregnant patients without
 
04:42:19.368 --> 04:42:19.378 align:start position:0%
being in violation of the law
 
04:42:21.470 --> 04:42:21.480 align:start position:0%
we implore you to respect the rights of
 
04:42:23.090 --> 04:42:23.100 align:start position:0%
bodily autonomy the right to private
 
04:42:24.708 --> 04:42:24.718 align:start position:0%
medical decision making and the
 
04:42:26.208 --> 04:42:26.218 align:start position:0%
professional Judgment of doctors caring
 
04:42:28.368 --> 04:42:28.378 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire citizens and I will
 
04:42:29.930 --> 04:42:29.940 align:start position:0%
add that there are significant reasons
 
04:42:31.550 --> 04:42:31.560 align:start position:0%
why abortions are not provided before
 
04:42:34.730 --> 04:42:34.740 align:start position:0%
six weeks oh thank you yeah and I will
 
04:42:36.948 --> 04:42:36.958 align:start position:0%
say there are important reasons why this
 
04:42:39.350 --> 04:42:39.360 align:start position:0%
becomes a near total abortion ban while
 
04:42:41.208 --> 04:42:41.218 align:start position:0%
we do receive phone calls from people
 
04:42:44.090 --> 04:42:44.100 align:start position:0%
who are earlier gestation than six weeks
 
04:42:45.770 --> 04:42:45.780 align:start position:0%
by estimation
 
04:42:47.330 --> 04:42:47.340 align:start position:0%
there are important reasons why we don't
 
04:42:49.070 --> 04:42:49.080 align:start position:0%
provide abortion Services before six
 
04:42:50.690 --> 04:42:50.700 align:start position:0%
weeks and one is because it's medically
 
04:42:52.310 --> 04:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
necessary for us to rule out the
 
04:42:54.650 --> 04:42:54.660 align:start position:0%
possibility of ectopic pregnancy which
 
04:42:56.570 --> 04:42:56.580 align:start position:0%
if treated as an intrauterine pregnancy
 
04:42:58.610 --> 04:42:58.620 align:start position:0%
or pregnancy in the uterus could be very
 
04:43:01.550 --> 04:43:01.560 align:start position:0%
dangerous and so if we're talking about
 
04:43:03.170 --> 04:43:03.180 align:start position:0%
the detection of feudal heartbeat around
 
04:43:05.030 --> 04:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
six weeks and we're talking about the
 
04:43:06.830 --> 04:43:06.840 align:start position:0%
medical necessity to wait until six
 
04:43:09.230 --> 04:43:09.240 align:start position:0%
weeks to preserve life and the safety of
 
04:43:11.090 --> 04:43:11.100 align:start position:0%
our patients then we are talking about a
 
04:43:12.770 --> 04:43:12.780 align:start position:0%
near total abortion ban which I know
 
04:43:14.930 --> 04:43:14.940 align:start position:0%
most citizens in our state are not in
 
04:43:17.390 --> 04:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
favor of thank you
 
04:43:21.590 --> 04:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:23.990 --> 04:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
nope seeing none thank you
 
04:43:27.350 --> 04:43:27.360 align:start position:0%
and we now call Marion aliegro
 
04:43:29.090 --> 04:43:29.100 align:start position:0%

04:43:29.100 --> 04:43:31.970 align:start position:0%

um thank you Mr chair and members of

I thought I was coming here to represent
 
04:43:47.330 --> 04:43:47.340 align:start position:0%
a lot of people at home but after
 
04:43:49.310 --> 04:43:49.320 align:start position:0%
hearing a lot of all of this testimony
 
04:43:51.830 --> 04:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
today I feel like I'm here to represent
 
04:43:51.840 --> 04:43:53.150 align:start position:0%
today I feel like I'm here to represent
cells

04:43:53.150 --> 04:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
cells
 
04:43:55.368 --> 04:43:55.378 align:start position:0%
I'd like to ask everyone in the room to
 
04:43:57.288 --> 04:43:57.298 align:start position:0%
please answer questions silently to
 
04:44:00.708 --> 04:44:00.718 align:start position:0%
themselves why do we insist on closing
 
04:44:03.530 --> 04:44:03.540 align:start position:0%
the East Coast beaches during piping
 
04:44:06.410 --> 04:44:06.420 align:start position:0%
plover and sea turtle nesting and
 
04:44:08.270 --> 04:44:08.280 align:start position:0%
gestation season
 
04:44:10.128 --> 04:44:10.138 align:start position:0%
after all we're only talking about
 
04:44:12.708 --> 04:44:12.718 align:start position:0%
disturbing a bunch of eggs on or under
 
04:44:16.550 --> 04:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
the sand what's so precious about that
 
04:44:18.530 --> 04:44:18.540 align:start position:0%
no doubt some of you are thinking that's
 
04:44:21.050 --> 04:44:21.060 align:start position:0%
a silly question if we destroyed all the
 
04:44:23.090 --> 04:44:23.100 align:start position:0%
eggs on our beaches there'll be no more
 
04:44:26.690 --> 04:44:26.700 align:start position:0%
piping plovers or sea turtles and it's
 
04:44:29.628 --> 04:44:29.638 align:start position:0%
our responsibility to protect them and
 
04:44:31.430 --> 04:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
you would be right
 
04:44:34.128 --> 04:44:34.138 align:start position:0%
as a scientist I would like to tell you
 
04:44:36.288 --> 04:44:36.298 align:start position:0%
something about the Bunches of eggs on
 
04:44:39.650 --> 04:44:39.660 align:start position:0%
or under our East Coast beaches each egg
 
04:44:42.770 --> 04:44:42.780 align:start position:0%
contains a bunch of cells each started
 
04:44:46.550 --> 04:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
with only two cells an egg and a sperm
 
04:44:48.890 --> 04:44:48.900 align:start position:0%
the little Bunches of cells in each of
 
04:44:50.650 --> 04:44:50.660 align:start position:0%
these eggs are very busy during
 
04:44:50.660 --> 04:44:52.330 align:start position:0%
these eggs are very busy during
gestation

04:44:52.330 --> 04:44:52.340 align:start position:0%
gestation
 
04:44:55.850 --> 04:44:55.860 align:start position:0%
miraculously dividing and migrating and
 
04:44:57.830 --> 04:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
joining and signaling
 
04:45:00.410 --> 04:45:00.420 align:start position:0%
and separating and joining again and
 
04:45:02.448 --> 04:45:02.458 align:start position:0%
eventually they develop into beautiful
 
04:45:04.430 --> 04:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
little creatures that we call piping
 
04:45:07.550 --> 04:45:07.560 align:start position:0%
clovers and sea turtles
 
04:45:08.990 --> 04:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
as a mother
 
04:45:13.550 --> 04:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
I'm here now to ask to implore you this
 
04:45:16.430 --> 04:45:16.440 align:start position:0%
committee to wholeheartedly support I'll
 
04:45:16.440 --> 04:45:17.830 align:start position:0%

by supporting these legislation New
 
04:45:30.470 --> 04:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can help to protect the
 
04:45:32.750 --> 04:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
beautiful and miraculous Bunches of
 
04:45:36.650 --> 04:45:36.660 align:start position:0%

protect them too
 
04:45:55.610 --> 04:45:55.620 align:start position:0%
I will quote a little here the Lord

04:48:08.270 --> 04:48:08.280 align:start position:0%
I'm echoing some of the things that
 
04:48:11.570 --> 04:48:11.580 align:start position:0%
representative sellers said and that Mrs
 
04:48:14.990 --> 04:48:15.000 align:start position:0%
Allegro just said
 
04:48:18.230 --> 04:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
I urge you to support
 
04:48:19.810 --> 04:48:19.820 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
04:48:25.730 --> 04:48:25.740 align:start position:0%
591 FN I support it because it is to
 
04:48:30.050 --> 04:48:30.060 align:start position:0%
protect life at its very vulnerable
 
04:48:35.448 --> 04:48:35.458 align:start position:0%
position in its be in its life and it's
 
04:48:35.458 --> 04:48:37.250 align:start position:0%
position in its be in its life and it's
growing

04:48:37.250 --> 04:48:37.260 align:start position:0%
growing
 
04:48:37.260 --> 04:48:38.570 align:start position:0%
growing

and honest reality
 
04:48:55.128 --> 04:48:55.138 align:start position:0%

Parenthood

04:49:25.490 --> 04:49:25.500 align:start position:0%
Parenthood
 
04:49:27.890 --> 04:49:27.900 align:start position:0%
speak a little closer there you go
 
04:49:30.830 --> 04:49:30.840 align:start position:0%
um I I recognize it's been a long two
 
04:49:30.840 --> 04:49:31.850 align:start position:0%
um I I recognize it's been a long two
days

04:49:31.850 --> 04:49:31.860 align:start position:0%
days
 
04:49:31.860 --> 04:49:33.410 align:start position:0%
days
um

04:49:33.410 --> 04:49:33.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:36.230 --> 04:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
long two days and on behalf of Planned
 
04:49:37.788 --> 04:49:37.798 align:start position:0%
Parenthood I just want to say thank you
 
04:49:41.690 --> 04:49:41.700 align:start position:0%
all um everyone here has felt seen and
 
04:49:43.730 --> 04:49:43.740 align:start position:0%
heard with their testimony today and
 
04:49:46.850 --> 04:49:46.860 align:start position:0%
yesterday and we really appreciate it
 
04:49:49.610 --> 04:49:49.620 align:start position:0%
um in regards to House Bill 591 we
 
04:49:51.410 --> 04:49:51.420 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill because it is a near
 
04:49:53.930 --> 04:49:53.940 align:start position:0%
total ban on abortion when I say near
 
04:49:53.940 --> 04:49:55.070 align:start position:0%
total ban on abortion when I say near
total

04:49:55.070 --> 04:49:55.080 align:start position:0%
total
 
04:49:56.750 --> 04:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
I mean because it bans abortion around
 
04:49:59.948 --> 04:49:59.958 align:start position:0%
six weeks of pregnancy which is before
 
04:50:02.390 --> 04:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
many people even know that they are
 
04:50:03.830 --> 04:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
pregnant so
 
04:50:06.350 --> 04:50:06.360 align:start position:0%
it removes someone's ability to make a
 
04:50:07.910 --> 04:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
decision about their pregnancy before
 
04:50:09.830 --> 04:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
they even know that they have a decision
 
04:50:11.410 --> 04:50:11.420 align:start position:0%
to make
 
04:50:14.150 --> 04:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
this bill has been before this committee
 
04:50:16.730 --> 04:50:16.740 align:start position:0%
many many times before I have testified
 
04:50:19.550 --> 04:50:19.560 align:start position:0%
in opposition before this committee many
 
04:50:22.010 --> 04:50:22.020 align:start position:0%
many times before what is different
 
04:50:24.770 --> 04:50:24.780 align:start position:0%
today of course is that this bill is no
 
04:50:26.750 --> 04:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
longer unconstitutional
 
04:50:29.090 --> 04:50:29.100 align:start position:0%
but what is not different today is that
 
04:50:31.070 --> 04:50:31.080 align:start position:0%
this bill is still deeply deeply
 
04:50:34.368 --> 04:50:34.378 align:start position:0%
unpopular and is bad public policy and
 
04:50:38.390 --> 04:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:42.410 --> 04:50:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:44.330 --> 04:50:44.340 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you
 
04:50:46.310 --> 04:50:46.320 align:start position:0%
Danielle Pimentel
 
04:50:48.770 --> 04:50:48.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman or Mr Vice
 
04:50:50.270 --> 04:50:50.280 align:start position:0%
chairman and members of the committee I
 
04:50:52.310 --> 04:50:52.320 align:start position:0%
also want to thank you so much for
 
04:50:54.590 --> 04:50:54.600 align:start position:0%
allowing all of us to give testimony
 
04:50:56.208 --> 04:50:56.218 align:start position:0%
over these past two days I know it's
 
04:50:58.610 --> 04:50:58.620 align:start position:0%
been a long two days so thank you for
 
04:51:01.310 --> 04:51:01.320 align:start position:0%
your endurance and your consideration
 
04:51:03.530 --> 04:51:03.540 align:start position:0%
um I my name is Daniel Pimentel and I
 
04:51:06.590 --> 04:51:06.600 align:start position:0%
work with American United for life and I
 
04:51:10.430 --> 04:51:10.440 align:start position:0%
urge your support of HB 591 for three
 
04:51:12.948 --> 04:51:12.958 align:start position:0%
reasons and first the bill protects the
 
04:51:14.868 --> 04:51:14.878 align:start position:0%
health and safety of pregnant women and
 
04:51:17.030 --> 04:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
pre-born children which is a legitimate
 
04:51:19.788 --> 04:51:19.798 align:start position:0%
interest for New Hampshire in the Dobbs
 
04:51:21.590 --> 04:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
decision the Supreme Court stated that
 
04:51:23.390 --> 04:51:23.400 align:start position:0%
the that states have a legitimate
 
04:51:25.368 --> 04:51:25.378 align:start position:0%
interest in preserving prenatal life
 
04:51:27.708 --> 04:51:27.718 align:start position:0%
protecting maternal health and safety
 
04:51:30.230 --> 04:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
and mitigating fetal pain
 
04:51:32.930 --> 04:51:32.940 align:start position:0%
however New Hampshire allows abortions
 
04:51:35.390 --> 04:51:35.400 align:start position:0%
up to 24 weeks gestation and as we all
 
04:51:37.010 --> 04:51:37.020 align:start position:0%
know there has been legislation put
 
04:51:39.770 --> 04:51:39.780 align:start position:0%
forth to allow abortion on demand up
 
04:51:40.850 --> 04:51:40.860 align:start position:0%
until birth
 
04:51:44.030 --> 04:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
which subjects women and children to
 
04:51:47.810 --> 04:51:47.820 align:start position:0%
pre-on board children to um threatening
 
04:51:49.970 --> 04:51:49.980 align:start position:0%
health risks and possibly death and
 
04:51:51.788 --> 04:51:51.798 align:start position:0%
these include for the women blood clots
 
04:51:55.250 --> 04:51:55.260 align:start position:0%
hemorrhages incomplete abortions damage
 
04:51:57.830 --> 04:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
to internal organs
 
04:52:00.230 --> 04:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
Etc and for pre-born children scientists
 
04:52:02.868 --> 04:52:02.878 align:start position:0%
have found evidence of unborn children
 
04:52:05.030 --> 04:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
feeling pain as early as 12 weeks
 
04:52:05.040 --> 04:52:06.288 align:start position:0%
feeling pain as early as 12 weeks
gestation

04:52:06.288 --> 04:52:06.298 align:start position:0%
gestation
 
04:52:09.050 --> 04:52:09.060 align:start position:0%
so by enacting this bill the legislature
 
04:52:11.810 --> 04:52:11.820 align:start position:0%
is protecting unborn children while also
 
04:52:14.330 --> 04:52:14.340 align:start position:0%
greatly reducing the risks women face
 
04:52:16.490 --> 04:52:16.500 align:start position:0%
when seeking an abortion and as I said
 
04:52:17.690 --> 04:52:17.700 align:start position:0%
before that is in New Hampshire's
 
04:52:19.910 --> 04:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
legitimate interest to do so
 
04:52:21.410 --> 04:52:21.420 align:start position:0%
the second thing I want to mention is
 
04:52:23.690 --> 04:52:23.700 align:start position:0%
that the common narrative that we often
 
04:52:26.810 --> 04:52:26.820 align:start position:0%
hear is that abortion or abortion access
 
04:52:29.090 --> 04:52:29.100 align:start position:0%
is necessary for Women's Health and for
 
04:52:31.430 --> 04:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
their quality in American society and
 
04:52:34.010 --> 04:52:34.020 align:start position:0%
that's simply not true
 
04:52:37.128 --> 04:52:37.138 align:start position:0%
um the data shows that the rate of
 
04:52:40.010 --> 04:52:40.020 align:start position:0%
abortions is the current rate is nearly
 
04:52:41.990 --> 04:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
half of what it was in the late 1980s
 
04:52:44.390 --> 04:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
after Roe v Wade was decided so the
 
04:52:46.190 --> 04:52:46.200 align:start position:0%
evidence of that is showing that women
 
04:52:48.170 --> 04:52:48.180 align:start position:0%
are increasingly rejecting abortion
 
04:52:51.288 --> 04:52:51.298 align:start position:0%
they're recognizing the humanity of
 
04:52:53.390 --> 04:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
their unborn children and they are
 
04:52:54.948 --> 04:52:54.958 align:start position:0%
taking advantage of the resources that
 
04:52:57.050 --> 04:52:57.060 align:start position:0%
are available to them to either carry
 
04:52:59.990 --> 04:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
the baby and to term or give up their
 
04:53:01.970 --> 04:53:01.980 align:start position:0%
baby for adoption
 
04:53:04.430 --> 04:53:04.440 align:start position:0%
Pregnancy Resource Centers
 
04:53:07.010 --> 04:53:07.020 align:start position:0%
um also play a major part in empowering
 
04:53:08.990 --> 04:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
women and giving them the resources that
 
04:53:10.670 --> 04:53:10.680 align:start position:0%
they need to choose life and in New
 
04:53:12.230 --> 04:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there are many wonderful
 
04:53:14.270 --> 04:53:14.280 align:start position:0%
Pregnancy Resource Centers that stand
 
04:53:16.250 --> 04:53:16.260 align:start position:0%
ready to assist women if this bill is
 
04:53:18.770 --> 04:53:18.780 align:start position:0%
passed and these Pregnancy Resource
 
04:53:21.830 --> 04:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
Centers offer free resources counseling
 
04:53:24.350 --> 04:53:24.360 align:start position:0%
and material support
 
04:53:26.690 --> 04:53:26.700 align:start position:0%
ultimately women deserve better than
 
04:53:28.368 --> 04:53:28.378 align:start position:0%
abortion they deserve better than to be
 
04:53:30.890 --> 04:53:30.900 align:start position:0%
subjected to abortion procedures that
 
04:53:33.708 --> 04:53:33.718 align:start position:0%
threaten their lives that threaten their
 
04:53:36.650 --> 04:53:36.660 align:start position:0%
their bodies all of that
 
04:53:39.170 --> 04:53:39.180 align:start position:0%
and this bill recognizes that by
 
04:53:40.910 --> 04:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
enacting limits that will protect women
 
04:53:43.850 --> 04:53:43.860 align:start position:0%
as well as promote maternal health and
 
04:53:45.410 --> 04:53:45.420 align:start position:0%
Fetal life
 
04:53:48.110 --> 04:53:48.120 align:start position:0%
the last thing I want to mention is we
 
04:53:49.368 --> 04:53:49.378 align:start position:0%
heard testimony that this is not a
 
04:53:50.930 --> 04:53:50.940 align:start position:0%
popular thing this kind of legislation
 
04:53:53.990 --> 04:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
that's not true either after the Supreme
 
04:53:55.970 --> 04:53:55.980 align:start position:0%
Court overturned Roe v Wade and Planned
 
04:53:58.430 --> 04:53:58.440 align:start position:0%
Parenthood um bkc there are many states
 
04:54:00.470 --> 04:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
that have enacted strong pro-life limits
 
04:54:02.810 --> 04:54:02.820 align:start position:0%
stronger than a heartbeat Bill there are
 
04:54:05.390 --> 04:54:05.400 align:start position:0%
at least 18 states that have enacted
 
04:54:07.970 --> 04:54:07.980 align:start position:0%
um life or laws in which they ban
 
04:54:10.550 --> 04:54:10.560 align:start position:0%
abortion at any gestational age so from
 
04:54:12.288 --> 04:54:12.298 align:start position:0%
conception and there are at least three
 
04:54:15.170 --> 04:54:15.180 align:start position:0%
other states that do have bills which
 
04:54:17.570 --> 04:54:17.580 align:start position:0%
ban abortion after a heartbeat is
 
04:54:19.310 --> 04:54:19.320 align:start position:0%
detected a fetal heartbeat is detected
 
04:54:21.410 --> 04:54:21.420 align:start position:0%
and so New Hampshire would be joining
 
04:54:23.930 --> 04:54:23.940 align:start position:0%
these states and affirming
 
04:54:26.270 --> 04:54:26.280 align:start position:0%
um their legitimate interest to protect
 
04:54:28.788 --> 04:54:28.798 align:start position:0%
the state's most vulnerable citizens and
 
04:54:30.230 --> 04:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
for these reasons I urge the committee
 
04:54:33.650 --> 04:54:33.660 align:start position:0%
to support HB 5191 and I thank you again
 
04:54:35.750 --> 04:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
so much for allowing me to testify here
 
04:54:37.910 --> 04:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
these past few days
 
04:54:42.230 --> 04:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:43.970 --> 04:54:43.980 align:start position:0%
seeing none we thank you thank you very
 
04:54:56.090 --> 04:54:56.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:58.250 --> 04:54:58.260 align:start position:0%
hello again
 
04:55:01.010 --> 04:55:01.020 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to put you through the
 
04:55:03.230 --> 04:55:03.240 align:start position:0%
story again you've heard it two days in
 
04:55:04.128 --> 04:55:04.138 align:start position:0%
a row
 
04:55:07.850 --> 04:55:07.860 align:start position:0%
you know that my life was horrible
 
04:55:12.110 --> 04:55:12.120 align:start position:0%
um and I'm here to strongly oppose HB
 
04:55:12.120 --> 04:55:14.510 align:start position:0%
um and I'm here to strongly oppose HB
591

04:55:14.510 --> 04:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
591
 
04:55:18.288 --> 04:55:18.298 align:start position:0%
my abortion saved my life
 
04:55:21.470 --> 04:55:21.480 align:start position:0%
I found out I was pregnant at eight
 
04:55:21.480 --> 04:55:22.788 align:start position:0%
I found out I was pregnant at eight
weeks

04:55:22.788 --> 04:55:22.798 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
04:55:25.490 --> 04:55:25.500 align:start position:0%
and scheduled an abortion my sister
 
04:55:28.730 --> 04:55:28.740 align:start position:0%
Deirdre who is no longer with us
 
04:55:31.250 --> 04:55:31.260 align:start position:0%
took me to get it
 
04:55:33.708 --> 04:55:33.718 align:start position:0%
I had to wait an additional two weeks
 
04:55:36.830 --> 04:55:36.840 align:start position:0%
after I had the urine test
 
04:55:41.090 --> 04:55:41.100 align:start position:0%
so by then I was 10 weeks pregnant
 
04:55:43.788 --> 04:55:43.798 align:start position:0%
my sister tried to protect us
 
04:55:47.810 --> 04:55:47.820 align:start position:0%
she saved my life when I was 16.
 
04:55:50.628 --> 04:55:50.638 align:start position:0%
when we found when we found out I was
 
04:55:53.270 --> 04:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
pregnant Deirdre said to me
 
04:55:56.510 --> 04:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
Jesus Christ Patty if he finds out
 
04:55:59.270 --> 04:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
you're pregnant he's going to beat you
 
04:56:00.890 --> 04:56:00.900 align:start position:0%
to death
 
04:56:03.410 --> 04:56:03.420 align:start position:0%
I've heard a lot of talk the last two
 
04:56:06.590 --> 04:56:06.600 align:start position:0%
days about bodily autonomy
 
04:56:08.690 --> 04:56:08.700 align:start position:0%
and freedom
 
04:56:12.350 --> 04:56:12.360 align:start position:0%
and protection of The Unborn
 
04:56:19.430 --> 04:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
nobody was protecting me at 16.
 
04:56:21.410 --> 04:56:21.420 align:start position:0%
that abortion
 
04:56:24.650 --> 04:56:24.660 align:start position:0%
kept me from being literally beaten to
 
04:56:24.660 --> 04:56:25.670 align:start position:0%
kept me from being literally beaten to
death

04:56:25.670 --> 04:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
death
 
04:56:28.448 --> 04:56:28.458 align:start position:0%
and since you've all heard this story
 
04:56:31.788 --> 04:56:31.798 align:start position:0%
you know that it's true
 
04:56:34.010 --> 04:56:34.020 align:start position:0%
to take away
 
04:56:38.448 --> 04:56:38.458 align:start position:0%
my bodily autonomy to take away my
 
04:56:41.990 --> 04:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
daughters Reproductive Rights
 
04:56:45.288 --> 04:56:45.298 align:start position:0%
to take away our freedom
 
04:56:47.990 --> 04:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
is horrific
 
04:56:51.650 --> 04:56:51.660 align:start position:0%
I never experienced bodily autonomy
 
04:56:54.530 --> 04:56:54.540 align:start position:0%
until I was 16.
 
04:56:58.010 --> 04:56:58.020 align:start position:0%
I didn't know about freedom
 
04:57:01.070 --> 04:57:01.080 align:start position:0%
and so as you're all here considering
 
04:57:03.530 --> 04:57:03.540 align:start position:0%
the fetal heartbeat
 
04:57:06.530 --> 04:57:06.540 align:start position:0%
think about my heartbeat
 
04:57:10.930 --> 04:57:10.940 align:start position:0%
at 16. think about my heartbeat
 
04:57:14.270 --> 04:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
terrified that I would be beaten to
 
04:57:14.280 --> 04:57:15.230 align:start position:0%
terrified that I would be beaten to
death

04:57:15.230 --> 04:57:15.240 align:start position:0%
death
 
04:57:17.868 --> 04:57:17.878 align:start position:0%
think about my heartbeat today with a
 
04:57:17.878 --> 04:57:18.890 align:start position:0%
think about my heartbeat today with a
daughter

04:57:18.890 --> 04:57:18.900 align:start position:0%
daughter
 
04:57:21.650 --> 04:57:21.660 align:start position:0%
think about my heartbeat with my dead
 
04:57:21.660 --> 04:57:22.670 align:start position:0%
think about my heartbeat with my dead
sister

04:57:22.670 --> 04:57:22.680 align:start position:0%
sister
 
04:57:25.970 --> 04:57:25.980 align:start position:0%
who's died from his beatings
 
04:57:29.330 --> 04:57:29.340 align:start position:0%
do not think that everybody has the same
 
04:57:32.448 --> 04:57:32.458 align:start position:0%
story we don't run off to clinics to
 
04:57:35.570 --> 04:57:35.580 align:start position:0%
have abortions it is a horrible
 
04:57:38.090 --> 04:57:38.100 align:start position:0%
difficult decision
 
04:57:40.730 --> 04:57:40.740 align:start position:0%
but it saved my life
 
04:57:44.690 --> 04:57:44.700 align:start position:0%
and I urge you so strongly as does the
 
04:57:47.510 --> 04:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
majority of this country
 
04:57:52.510 --> 04:57:52.520 align:start position:0%
to not pass or even consider this bill
 
04:57:56.208 --> 04:57:56.218 align:start position:0%
this bill will not save lives this bill
 
04:58:00.530 --> 04:58:00.540 align:start position:0%
will destroy lives it will kill women
 
04:58:04.788 --> 04:58:04.798 align:start position:0%
and it will be an ultimate disaster you
 
04:58:09.110 --> 04:58:09.120 align:start position:0%
will be seeing hangers used again I
 
04:58:13.190 --> 04:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill and I thank you for
 
04:58:15.830 --> 04:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
listening to my story
 
04:58:18.110 --> 04:58:18.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:58:23.750 --> 04:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:31.850 --> 04:58:31.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:31.860 --> 04:58:33.350 align:start position:0%
 
hello

04:58:33.350 --> 04:58:33.360 align:start position:0%
hello
 
04:58:36.050 --> 04:58:36.060 align:start position:0%
uh Kathy Holmes
 
04:58:38.990 --> 04:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
and we all agree we're talking about
 
04:58:39.000 --> 04:58:40.010 align:start position:0%
and we all agree we're talking about
life

04:58:40.010 --> 04:58:40.020 align:start position:0%
life
 
04:58:43.250 --> 04:58:43.260 align:start position:0%
unborn life this committee also handles
 
04:58:45.050 --> 04:58:45.060 align:start position:0%
the gun bills
 
04:58:48.170 --> 04:58:48.180 align:start position:0%
well imagine what talking points the
 
04:58:52.070 --> 04:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
left would have if they could say 63
 
04:58:57.170 --> 04:58:57.180 align:start position:0%
million babies have been killed by guns
 
04:58:57.180 --> 04:58:58.368 align:start position:0%
million babies have been killed by guns
now

04:58:58.368 --> 04:58:58.378 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:58:58.378 --> 04:58:59.810 align:start position:0%
now
uh

04:58:59.810 --> 04:58:59.820 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:59:04.010 --> 04:59:04.020 align:start position:0%
I think how lopsided the left's energies
 
04:59:05.690 --> 04:59:05.700 align:start position:0%
are being spent
 
04:59:08.990 --> 04:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
they ignore the science of today
 
04:59:11.690 --> 04:59:11.700 align:start position:0%
and they're stuck 50 years ago when we
 
04:59:15.410 --> 04:59:15.420 align:start position:0%
really didn't know but now we do
 
04:59:18.470 --> 04:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
and in all this conversation
 
04:59:22.190 --> 04:59:22.200 align:start position:0%
I have to ask why aren't we hearing
 
04:59:24.890 --> 04:59:24.900 align:start position:0%
about the women's
 
04:59:27.530 --> 04:59:27.540 align:start position:0%
each person's responsibility for their
 
04:59:30.590 --> 04:59:30.600 align:start position:0%
own body and the choices they make
 
04:59:33.470 --> 04:59:33.480 align:start position:0%
like my husband says pro-choice before
 
04:59:37.310 --> 04:59:37.320 align:start position:0%
the ACT not the fact there is no no
 
04:59:40.490 --> 04:59:40.500 align:start position:0%
weight put on how you got in that
 
04:59:43.850 --> 04:59:43.860 align:start position:0%
position you you know what the what
 
04:59:45.590 --> 04:59:45.600 align:start position:0%
could happen
 
04:59:49.430 --> 04:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
and that then now the problems the
 
04:59:53.090 --> 04:59:53.100 align:start position:0%
consequences are put on us to be feel
 
04:59:55.610 --> 04:59:55.620 align:start position:0%
guilty for the consequences
 
04:59:57.708 --> 04:59:57.718 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
04:59:59.750 --> 04:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
and I know girls
 
05:00:04.368 --> 05:00:04.378 align:start position:0%
are misled well uh so
 
05:00:06.470 --> 05:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
that's another problem but that's not
 
05:00:09.050 --> 05:00:09.060 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about right now
 
05:00:11.750 --> 05:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
I think that's
 
05:00:16.010 --> 05:00:16.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:19.788 --> 05:00:19.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:33.708 --> 05:00:33.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:36.050 --> 05:00:36.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr acting chair my name is
 
05:00:37.850 --> 05:00:37.860 align:start position:0%
Jason Hennessey as you've probably heard
 
05:00:39.050 --> 05:00:39.060 align:start position:0%
a few times over the last two days
 
05:00:41.208 --> 05:00:41.218 align:start position:0%
president of New Hampshire to life and
 
05:00:42.530 --> 05:00:42.540 align:start position:0%
I'm here to represent the pro-life
 
05:00:44.570 --> 05:00:44.580 align:start position:0%
constituents of New Hampshire
 
05:00:48.310 --> 05:00:48.320 align:start position:0%
we support HB 591
 
05:00:51.050 --> 05:00:51.060 align:start position:0%
we all support I mean most most people
 
05:00:53.208 --> 05:00:53.218 align:start position:0%
support bodily autonomy across New
 
05:00:54.650 --> 05:00:54.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where the live for your days
 
05:00:56.868 --> 05:00:56.878 align:start position:0%
or Live Free or Die state
 
05:00:59.208 --> 05:00:59.218 align:start position:0%
uh but the question here is is there a
 
05:01:02.090 --> 05:01:02.100 align:start position:0%
second person and and we have many laws
 
05:01:03.830 --> 05:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
that involve when you're when your
 
05:01:05.208 --> 05:01:05.218 align:start position:0%
autonomy comes in contact with somebody
 
05:01:07.310 --> 05:01:07.320 align:start position:0%
else's autonomy and that's what we're
 
05:01:09.050 --> 05:01:09.060 align:start position:0%
here to talk about
 
05:01:11.570 --> 05:01:11.580 align:start position:0%
the second person this unborn child this
 
05:01:14.030 --> 05:01:14.040 align:start position:0%
unborn child cannot scream for help
 
05:01:17.810 --> 05:01:17.820 align:start position:0%
cannot run away and cannot hit back
 
05:01:20.330 --> 05:01:20.340 align:start position:0%
so who is more innocent than that who is
 
05:01:22.430 --> 05:01:22.440 align:start position:0%
more worthy of our protection as a
 
05:01:22.440 --> 05:01:24.708 align:start position:0%
more worthy of our protection as a
society

05:01:24.708 --> 05:01:24.718 align:start position:0%
society
 
05:01:28.910 --> 05:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
so the question is who is a person
 
05:01:33.050 --> 05:01:33.060 align:start position:0%
and what rights do people deserve
 
05:01:34.610 --> 05:01:34.620 align:start position:0%
so that's the question that we need to
 
05:01:37.150 --> 05:01:37.160 align:start position:0%
struggle with here is
 
05:01:41.270 --> 05:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
who is an under for an unborn child
 
05:01:44.750 --> 05:01:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:47.090 --> 05:01:47.100 align:start position:0%
many many of the center of our greatest
 
05:01:49.850 --> 05:01:49.860 align:start position:0%
uh the greatest atrocities that we can
 
05:01:51.948 --> 05:01:51.958 align:start position:0%
think of just even in the last century
 
05:01:54.770 --> 05:01:54.780 align:start position:0%
center around who is a person
 
05:01:56.990 --> 05:01:57.000 align:start position:0%
and what rights did they get or what
 
05:02:00.350 --> 05:02:00.360 align:start position:0%
rights were they deprived of
 
05:02:03.230 --> 05:02:03.240 align:start position:0%
from a practical perspective
 
05:02:05.510 --> 05:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is lacking children we're
 
05:02:07.368 --> 05:02:07.378 align:start position:0%
one of the oldest states in the country
 
05:02:10.010 --> 05:02:10.020 align:start position:0%
if not the oldest
 
05:02:12.230 --> 05:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
you know imagine imagine the children
 
05:02:16.368 --> 05:02:16.378 align:start position:0%
that we need to just even to function
 
05:02:18.470 --> 05:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
our school enrollments are shrinking who
 
05:02:19.850 --> 05:02:19.860 align:start position:0%
are going to be our next generation of
 
05:02:19.860 --> 05:02:20.810 align:start position:0%
are going to be our next generation of
leaders

05:02:20.810 --> 05:02:20.820 align:start position:0%
leaders
 
05:02:22.670 --> 05:02:22.680 align:start position:0%
you know some the some of the thousands
 
05:02:23.868 --> 05:02:23.878 align:start position:0%
of children that lose their lives to
 
05:02:25.610 --> 05:02:25.620 align:start position:0%
abortion every year those could have
 
05:02:28.788 --> 05:02:28.798 align:start position:0%
been some of our greatest leaders
 
05:02:31.010 --> 05:02:31.020 align:start position:0%
and there's many there's many supports
 
05:02:32.030 --> 05:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
for women
 
05:02:34.070 --> 05:02:34.080 align:start position:0%
um who find themselves with an unplanned
 
05:02:34.080 --> 05:02:35.030 align:start position:0%
um who find themselves with an unplanned
pregnancy

05:02:35.030 --> 05:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
pregnancy
 
05:02:37.010 --> 05:02:37.020 align:start position:0%
we have New Hampshire's Safe Haven law
 
05:02:38.930 --> 05:02:38.940 align:start position:0%
which means nobody is required to raise
 
05:02:40.750 --> 05:02:40.760 align:start position:0%
a child that you didn't sign up to do
 
05:02:43.128 --> 05:02:43.138 align:start position:0%
anybody can drop off their child within
 
05:02:44.510 --> 05:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
the first seven days of life no
 
05:02:46.128 --> 05:02:46.138 align:start position:0%
questions asked
 
05:02:48.110 --> 05:02:48.120 align:start position:0%
we also have at least 15 pregnancy
 
05:02:48.120 --> 05:02:49.310 align:start position:0%
we also have at least 15 pregnancy
centers

05:02:49.310 --> 05:02:49.320 align:start position:0%
centers
 
05:02:52.010 --> 05:02:52.020 align:start position:0%
who stand by with counseling parenting
 
05:02:55.310 --> 05:02:55.320 align:start position:0%
classes mentors and tangible helps like
 
05:02:57.650 --> 05:02:57.660 align:start position:0%
strollers and diapers
 
05:02:59.510 --> 05:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
and they're there to come alongside and
 
05:03:02.030 --> 05:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
to provide help and they do it as far as
 
05:03:04.070 --> 05:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
I know completely free of charge
 
05:03:09.110 --> 05:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
I ask you to support HP 591 thank you
 
05:03:12.410 --> 05:03:12.420 align:start position:0%
any questions for this Witness
 
05:03:14.330 --> 05:03:14.340 align:start position:0%
representative Morgan
 
05:03:15.590 --> 05:03:15.600 align:start position:0%
um I just
 
05:03:17.990 --> 05:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
would you believe of a very small point
 
05:03:19.670 --> 05:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
but I'll get a question out of there too
 
05:03:21.530 --> 05:03:21.540 align:start position:0%
you mentioned uh we're actually we are
 
05:03:23.448 --> 05:03:23.458 align:start position:0%
the second oldest state in the country
 
05:03:26.208 --> 05:03:26.218 align:start position:0%
or average age is 43.1 the
 
05:03:29.270 --> 05:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
and we're right ahead of Vermont 43
 
05:03:33.350 --> 05:03:33.360 align:start position:0%
where I had made 45.0 and but I don't
 
05:03:35.270 --> 05:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
and I had I was doing another bill about
 
05:03:38.510 --> 05:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
it but do you feel is that like even we
 
05:03:40.190 --> 05:03:40.200 align:start position:0%
maybe need more of a solution than just
 
05:03:42.350 --> 05:03:42.360 align:start position:0%
like forcing women
 
05:03:44.570 --> 05:03:44.580 align:start position:0%
to give birth to babies they don't want
 
05:03:47.690 --> 05:03:47.700 align:start position:0%
to go to and um
 
05:03:49.490 --> 05:03:49.500 align:start position:0%
and uh so
 
05:03:51.110 --> 05:03:51.120 align:start position:0%
do you think this bill will be helpful
 
05:03:53.750 --> 05:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
or harmful or helpful for trying to get
 
05:03:55.850 --> 05:03:55.860 align:start position:0%
women of childbearing age to move here
 
05:03:58.430 --> 05:03:58.440 align:start position:0%
instead of to some other state
 
05:04:00.050 --> 05:04:00.060 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your question
 
05:04:03.230 --> 05:04:03.240 align:start position:0%
representative uh one one response I'll
 
05:04:05.208 --> 05:04:05.218 align:start position:0%
have is that the these states that have
 
05:04:07.010 --> 05:04:07.020 align:start position:0%
probably the most children per capita
 
05:04:09.050 --> 05:04:09.060 align:start position:0%
are also the states that have very
 
05:04:14.628 --> 05:04:14.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:19.010 --> 05:04:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:21.708 --> 05:04:21.718 align:start position:0%
singing on we thank you thank you I have
 
05:04:23.628 --> 05:04:23.638 align:start position:0%
no more pink cards is there anybody else
 
05:04:25.128 --> 05:04:25.138 align:start position:0%
in the room that would like to speak the
 
05:04:31.850 --> 05:04:31.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:40.850 --> 05:04:40.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:43.310 --> 05:04:43.320 align:start position:0%
go ahead Josie
 
05:04:45.530 --> 05:04:45.540 align:start position:0%
all right as others before me have said
 
05:04:46.910 --> 05:04:46.920 align:start position:0%
thank you all so much for your
 
05:04:48.948 --> 05:04:48.958 align:start position:0%
commitment to hearing us all these last
 
05:04:50.930 --> 05:04:50.940 align:start position:0%
few days really appreciate
 
05:04:53.030 --> 05:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
the spirit you've all brought
 
05:04:55.430 --> 05:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
um all right
 
05:04:55.440 --> 05:04:57.470 align:start position:0%
um all right
so

05:04:57.470 --> 05:04:57.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:04:59.990 --> 05:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
good afternoon I'm testifying in strong
 
05:05:03.110 --> 05:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
opposition today against HB 591
 
05:05:04.970 --> 05:05:04.980 align:start position:0%
I hope that it's clear that this ban
 
05:05:06.830 --> 05:05:06.840 align:start position:0%
would be a near total abortion ban if
 
05:05:09.830 --> 05:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
passed at six weeks gestation many
 
05:05:11.150 --> 05:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
pregnant people don't even know that
 
05:05:13.430 --> 05:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
they're pregnant yet this bill would
 
05:05:16.010 --> 05:05:16.020 align:start position:0%
absolutely Force the majority if not all
 
05:05:18.948 --> 05:05:18.958 align:start position:0%
patients to travel out of state for care
 
05:05:20.810 --> 05:05:20.820 align:start position:0%
that would put an incredible strain on
 
05:05:22.730 --> 05:05:22.740 align:start position:0%
the organization that I run as we help
 
05:05:24.410 --> 05:05:24.420 align:start position:0%
these patients pay for all kinds of
 
05:05:27.050 --> 05:05:27.060 align:start position:0%
increased costs such as travel hotel
 
05:05:30.350 --> 05:05:30.360 align:start position:0%
rooms in addition to the abortion itself
 
05:05:32.628 --> 05:05:32.638 align:start position:0%
since the fall of row nearly half of our
 
05:05:34.128 --> 05:05:34.138 align:start position:0%
country has already banned the right to
 
05:05:36.230 --> 05:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
abortion leaving patients with no other
 
05:05:38.030 --> 05:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
option but to travel incredibly far
 
05:05:40.550 --> 05:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
distances to receive care
 
05:05:42.590 --> 05:05:42.600 align:start position:0%
for some the hurdles of getting care are
 
05:05:43.730 --> 05:05:43.740 align:start position:0%
now too high
 
05:05:45.708 --> 05:05:45.718 align:start position:0%
since June my organization has had to
 
05:05:47.810 --> 05:05:47.820 align:start position:0%
help patients from 26 other states
 
05:05:50.150 --> 05:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
access care and I truly cannot imagine
 
05:05:52.250 --> 05:05:52.260 align:start position:0%
the consequences for abortion Seekers if
 
05:05:54.288 --> 05:05:54.298 align:start position:0%
abortion funds did not exist
 
05:05:56.690 --> 05:05:56.700 align:start position:0%
we've heard tragic stories of 12 year
 
05:05:59.150 --> 05:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
olds being denied care people facing
 
05:06:00.948 --> 05:06:00.958 align:start position:0%
medical bills upwards of fifteen
 
05:06:02.510 --> 05:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars being denied insurance
 
05:06:05.270 --> 05:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
coverage just really tough situations
 
05:06:07.070 --> 05:06:07.080 align:start position:0%
that no one deserves to find themselves
 
05:06:07.080 --> 05:06:08.510 align:start position:0%
that no one deserves to find themselves
in

05:06:08.510 --> 05:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:06:10.368 --> 05:06:10.378 align:start position:0%
I believe that no one should be forced
 
05:06:11.930 --> 05:06:11.940 align:start position:0%
to carry a pregnancy to term against
 
05:06:13.128 --> 05:06:13.138 align:start position:0%
their will
 
05:06:14.750 --> 05:06:14.760 align:start position:0%
as it can come with extreme medical
 
05:06:17.030 --> 05:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
consequences as we've heard from others
 
05:06:19.128 --> 05:06:19.138 align:start position:0%
testifying earlier today
 
05:06:21.050 --> 05:06:21.060 align:start position:0%
right now the states where abortion is
 
05:06:22.970 --> 05:06:22.980 align:start position:0%
legal are holding a lot as they work to
 
05:06:25.010 --> 05:06:25.020 align:start position:0%
accommodate increase increased needs
 
05:06:26.628 --> 05:06:26.638 align:start position:0%
from those traveling from other states
 
05:06:29.330 --> 05:06:29.340 align:start position:0%
to access care if New Hampshire is to
 
05:06:30.948 --> 05:06:30.958 align:start position:0%
also become one of the states that bans
 
05:06:33.230 --> 05:06:33.240 align:start position:0%
abortion care it will put an unfair
 
05:06:34.550 --> 05:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
increased burden on the states
 
05:06:35.750 --> 05:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
surrounding us that have already
 
05:06:38.330 --> 05:06:38.340 align:start position:0%
affirmed abortion rights this bill as
 
05:06:40.070 --> 05:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
proposed is Extreme and out of touch
 
05:06:41.868 --> 05:06:41.878 align:start position:0%
with the majority of granite saters who
 
05:06:44.570 --> 05:06:44.580 align:start position:0%
support access to abortion we cannot let
 
05:06:46.910 --> 05:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
this extreme bill pass I urge you all to
 
05:06:50.270 --> 05:06:50.280 align:start position:0%
vote against HB 591 thank you
 
05:06:54.890 --> 05:06:54.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:57.350 --> 05:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
yes representative Perez
 
05:06:58.850 --> 05:06:58.860 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:06:58.860 --> 05:07:01.190 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

05:07:01.190 --> 05:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:04.490 --> 05:07:04.500 align:start position:0%
are abortions after 15 weeks do you have
 
05:07:06.890 --> 05:07:06.900 align:start position:0%
to send them out of state
 
05:07:09.050 --> 05:07:09.060 align:start position:0%
not 15 weeks because the current law
 
05:07:11.990 --> 05:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
goes to 24 weeks no no but are they
 
05:07:14.330 --> 05:07:14.340 align:start position:0%
actually performed here in New Hampshire
 
05:07:16.970 --> 05:07:16.980 align:start position:0%
yes we typically send patients to
 
05:07:18.708 --> 05:07:18.718 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth hospital
 
05:07:21.288 --> 05:07:21.298 align:start position:0%
um but often they do go to Boston
 
05:07:23.090 --> 05:07:23.100 align:start position:0%
so it depends which is closer to the
 
05:07:25.310 --> 05:07:25.320 align:start position:0%
patient thank you
 
05:07:27.050 --> 05:07:27.060 align:start position:0%
any further questions for this this
 
05:07:27.060 --> 05:07:28.910 align:start position:0%
any further questions for this this
Witness

05:07:28.910 --> 05:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
Witness
 
05:07:31.910 --> 05:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time thank you
 
05:07:47.890 --> 05:07:47.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:50.208 --> 05:07:50.218 align:start position:0%
hi everyone thank you for giving me the
 
05:07:51.770 --> 05:07:51.780 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak today I wasn't sure
 
05:07:54.050 --> 05:07:54.060 align:start position:0%
if I was going to but my name is
 
05:07:56.628 --> 05:07:56.638 align:start position:0%
Clarissa Wankel and I'm a first year MSW
 
05:07:58.310 --> 05:07:58.320 align:start position:0%
student at the University of New
 
05:08:00.050 --> 05:08:00.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm a crisis counselor for
 
05:08:02.868 --> 05:08:02.878 align:start position:0%
the National Suicide Prevention lifeline
 
05:08:04.910 --> 05:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
suicide among women of reproductive age
 
05:08:07.250 --> 05:08:07.260 align:start position:0%
is high it's the second leading cause of
 
05:08:09.770 --> 05:08:09.780 align:start position:0%
death among women ages 20 to 24 and I
 
05:08:11.330 --> 05:08:11.340 align:start position:0%
just ask him could you just get a little
 
05:08:13.070 --> 05:08:13.080 align:start position:0%
closer to the microphone so we can hear
 
05:08:15.430 --> 05:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
it thank you
 
05:08:17.628 --> 05:08:17.638 align:start position:0%
suicide is the second leading cause of
 
05:08:20.570 --> 05:08:20.580 align:start position:0%
death among women ages 20 to 24 and it's
 
05:08:22.010 --> 05:08:22.020 align:start position:0%
the third leading cause of death among
 
05:08:25.430 --> 05:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
women ages 25 to 34. when researchers at
 
05:08:27.350 --> 05:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
UPenn analyzed the data they found a
 
05:08:29.150 --> 05:08:29.160 align:start position:0%
significant increase in suicide deaths
 
05:08:30.708 --> 05:08:30.718 align:start position:0%
and states where access to abortion was
 
05:08:32.810 --> 05:08:32.820 align:start position:0%
restricted by law which translates to
 
05:08:35.270 --> 05:08:35.280 align:start position:0%
roughly 125 more suicides per year
 
05:08:37.670 --> 05:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
amongst this population
 
05:08:40.010 --> 05:08:40.020 align:start position:0%
as a crisis counselor I heal calls from
 
05:08:41.930 --> 05:08:41.940 align:start position:0%
across the nation and I have noticed the
 
05:08:43.490 --> 05:08:43.500 align:start position:0%
increase in callers who feel like they
 
05:08:45.170 --> 05:08:45.180 align:start position:0%
have no choice but to kill themselves
 
05:08:47.570 --> 05:08:47.580 align:start position:0%
because they do not have access to
 
05:08:47.580 --> 05:08:49.490 align:start position:0%
because they do not have access to
abortion

05:08:49.490 --> 05:08:49.500 align:start position:0%
abortion
 
05:08:51.230 --> 05:08:51.240 align:start position:0%
if they fear that they can't get an
 
05:08:53.570 --> 05:08:53.580 align:start position:0%
abortion their lives will be ruined I've
 
05:08:55.368 --> 05:08:55.378 align:start position:0%
spoken to women experiencing domestic
 
05:08:56.750 --> 05:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
violence who are worried their partner
 
05:08:58.610 --> 05:08:58.620 align:start position:0%
will kill them or their child once they
 
05:08:59.510 --> 05:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
are born
 
05:09:01.490 --> 05:09:01.500 align:start position:0%
I've spoken to young women who do not
 
05:09:03.350 --> 05:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
have the financial resources or family
 
05:09:05.930 --> 05:09:05.940 align:start position:0%
support to raise a child
 
05:09:08.150 --> 05:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
and I have heard from women who have
 
05:09:09.770 --> 05:09:09.780 align:start position:0%
been sexually assaulted and don't know
 
05:09:12.050 --> 05:09:12.060 align:start position:0%
how to continue on with the trauma of
 
05:09:14.690 --> 05:09:14.700 align:start position:0%
being forced to carry a child a term
 
05:09:16.910 --> 05:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
what I'm asking is that you protect the
 
05:09:19.368 --> 05:09:19.378 align:start position:0%

06:03:11.628 --> 06:03:11.638 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
06:03:14.628 --> 06:03:14.638 align:start position:0%
uh the reason that I thought this
 
06:03:17.330 --> 06:03:17.340 align:start position:0%
legislation was needed was a specific
 
06:03:19.128 --> 06:03:19.138 align:start position:0%
situation that happened in my community
 
06:03:22.548 --> 06:03:22.558 align:start position:0%
that happens in other communities and I
 
06:03:25.970 --> 06:03:25.980 align:start position:0%
wanted to work to fix that
 
06:03:28.610 --> 06:03:28.620 align:start position:0%
I had a situation I should be begin with
 
06:03:30.890 --> 06:03:30.900 align:start position:0%
I am a former Library trustee I spent
 
06:03:34.070 --> 06:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
two terms as a library trustee
 
06:03:37.970 --> 06:03:37.980 align:start position:0%
and we had a situation where an event
 
06:03:39.830 --> 06:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
was planned at the library it was
 
06:03:39.840 --> 06:03:41.208 align:start position:0%
was planned at the library it was
controversial

06:03:41.208 --> 06:03:41.218 align:start position:0%
controversial
 
06:03:44.690 --> 06:03:44.700 align:start position:0%
I made a comment such as
 
06:03:46.970 --> 06:03:46.980 align:start position:0%
did the trustees talk about this they
 
06:03:48.770 --> 06:03:48.780 align:start position:0%
should have talked about it and then the
 
06:03:50.930 --> 06:03:50.940 align:start position:0%
public would have more information
 
06:03:50.940 --> 06:03:55.070 align:start position:0%
public would have more information
and

06:03:55.070 --> 06:03:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:57.410 --> 06:03:57.420 align:start position:0%
I guess that made some people unhappy
 
06:04:00.650 --> 06:04:00.660 align:start position:0%
that I thought the trustees and the um
 
06:04:02.930 --> 06:04:02.940 align:start position:0%
the community and the library directors
 
06:04:05.810 --> 06:04:05.820 align:start position:0%
should should discuss the the matter the
 
06:04:08.208 --> 06:04:08.218 align:start position:0%
library director she was quite new she
 
06:04:12.590 --> 06:04:12.600 align:start position:0%
made the decision to create an event on
 
06:04:13.670 --> 06:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
her own
 
06:04:15.770 --> 06:04:15.780 align:start position:0%
and there was just a lot of a lot of
 
06:04:17.628 --> 06:04:17.638 align:start position:0%
confusion and a lot of
 
06:04:20.990 --> 06:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
um conversation in the community over it
 
06:04:23.510 --> 06:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
um I have a friend and she's here today
 
06:04:26.270 --> 06:04:26.280 align:start position:0%
she's she was a library trustee at that
 
06:04:28.910 --> 06:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
library at the time and she didn't have
 
06:04:30.288 --> 06:04:30.298 align:start position:0%
information about it and was getting
 
06:04:33.590 --> 06:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
constituent contacts about it
 
06:04:35.810 --> 06:04:35.820 align:start position:0%
the library stopped answering their
 
06:04:38.090 --> 06:04:38.100 align:start position:0%
phone and
 
06:04:40.850 --> 06:04:40.860 align:start position:0%
we both went over there to find out what
 
06:04:42.650 --> 06:04:42.660 align:start position:0%
was happening
 
06:04:44.930 --> 06:04:44.940 align:start position:0%
um I went because my friend had surgery
 
06:04:46.548 --> 06:04:46.558 align:start position:0%
and couldn't get in the building because
 
06:04:48.650 --> 06:04:48.660 align:start position:0%
it's not ADA Compliant she had knee
 
06:04:50.150 --> 06:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
surgery and couldn't get up the steps
 
06:04:52.670 --> 06:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
without someone behind her to help
 
06:04:55.490 --> 06:04:55.500 align:start position:0%
we walked into the library and the first
 
06:04:57.410 --> 06:04:57.420 align:start position:0%
thing that the library director said to
 
06:05:00.650 --> 06:05:00.660 align:start position:0%
us before we said anything was
 
06:05:02.868 --> 06:05:02.878 align:start position:0%
I have made the decision to cancel the
 
06:05:02.878 --> 06:05:04.430 align:start position:0%
I have made the decision to cancel the
event

06:05:04.430 --> 06:05:04.440 align:start position:0%
event
 
06:05:06.590 --> 06:05:06.600 align:start position:0%
is that okay that's that's good to know
 
06:05:08.570 --> 06:05:08.580 align:start position:0%
and then we talked about the event a
 
06:05:09.830 --> 06:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
06:05:13.610 --> 06:05:13.620 align:start position:0%
um and any person in most most libraries
 
06:05:16.250 --> 06:05:16.260 align:start position:0%
in this state have a policy that any
 
06:05:17.810 --> 06:05:17.820 align:start position:0%
person in the community is welcome to
 
06:05:20.448 --> 06:05:20.458 align:start position:0%
come in and talk to the library
 
06:05:23.330 --> 06:05:23.340 align:start position:0%
Personnel the director about issues they
 
06:05:25.430 --> 06:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
care about have concerns about if that's
 
06:05:27.350 --> 06:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
the case for any person in the community
 
06:05:29.570 --> 06:05:29.580 align:start position:0%
it's certainly the case for a library
 
06:05:31.250 --> 06:05:31.260 align:start position:0%
trustee I think this should go without
 
06:05:34.788 --> 06:05:34.798 align:start position:0%
saying well there was a person
 
06:05:34.798 --> 06:05:36.230 align:start position:0%
saying well there was a person
um

06:05:36.230 --> 06:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:05:38.810 --> 06:05:38.820 align:start position:0%
on the Town Council who disagreed with
 
06:05:41.990 --> 06:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
that and he went to the next Library
 
06:05:44.150 --> 06:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
trustee meeting where the library
 
06:05:47.448 --> 06:05:47.458 align:start position:0%
director said right at that meeting
 
06:05:49.610 --> 06:05:49.620 align:start position:0%
that she had made the decision to cancel
 
06:05:51.708 --> 06:05:51.718 align:start position:0%
the event on her own that was her
 
06:05:54.948 --> 06:05:54.958 align:start position:0%
decision she was concerned about safety
 
06:05:59.030 --> 06:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
and he knew that but then at the next
 
06:06:02.448 --> 06:06:02.458 align:start position:0%
town council meeting he went they went
 
06:06:06.170 --> 06:06:06.180 align:start position:0%
into non-public session and
 
06:06:11.470 --> 06:06:11.480 align:start position:0%
my guess is that he may have made
 
06:06:16.010 --> 06:06:16.020 align:start position:0%
misrepresented the the uh what the
 
06:06:18.770 --> 06:06:18.780 align:start position:0%
library director said or didn't tell the
 
06:06:20.270 --> 06:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
other counselors that that's what
 
06:06:22.548 --> 06:06:22.558 align:start position:0%
happened they voted to open an
 
06:06:25.490 --> 06:06:25.500 align:start position:0%
investigation and hire a law firm to
 
06:06:27.288 --> 06:06:27.298 align:start position:0%
spend taxpayer money to do an
 
06:06:29.510 --> 06:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
investigation about any labor laws being
 
06:06:33.350 --> 06:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
being uh violated I was out of state on
 
06:06:35.448 --> 06:06:35.458 align:start position:0%
a on a family emergency when I got a
 
06:06:37.310 --> 06:06:37.320 align:start position:0%
phone call about that from the law firm
 
06:06:39.590 --> 06:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
and I said to the man at the law firm
 
06:06:43.910 --> 06:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
just go watch the town council meeting
 
06:06:46.010 --> 06:06:46.020 align:start position:0%
where I try to explain things because it
 
06:06:47.868 --> 06:06:47.878 align:start position:0%
seemed like there was some intentional
 
06:06:51.350 --> 06:06:51.360 align:start position:0%
misinterpretation of what I was saying
 
06:06:54.410 --> 06:06:54.420 align:start position:0%
which was not very much really
 
06:06:54.420 --> 06:06:56.570 align:start position:0%
which was not very much really
um

06:06:56.570 --> 06:06:56.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:56.580 --> 06:06:58.788 align:start position:0%
 
and

06:06:58.788 --> 06:06:58.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:07:01.070 --> 06:07:01.080 align:start position:0%
I was saying the same thing over again
 
06:07:02.990 --> 06:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
to the library trustees when they had an
 
06:07:04.128 --> 06:07:04.138 align:start position:0%
interest in it and I went to that
 
06:07:05.628 --> 06:07:05.638 align:start position:0%
meeting as well as I was saying the
 
06:07:08.330 --> 06:07:08.340 align:start position:0%
exact same story over and over again so
 
06:07:10.310 --> 06:07:10.320 align:start position:0%
I said just go get the minutes from the
 
06:07:12.288 --> 06:07:12.298 align:start position:0%
library trustee go watch the video from
 
06:07:13.730 --> 06:07:13.740 align:start position:0%
the town council meeting there were no
 
06:07:16.490 --> 06:07:16.500 align:start position:0%
labor law violations anyone can talk to
 
06:07:19.490 --> 06:07:19.500 align:start position:0%
library directors about about that the
 
06:07:19.500 --> 06:07:20.208 align:start position:0%
library directors about about that the
the

06:07:20.208 --> 06:07:20.218 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:07:22.788 --> 06:07:22.798 align:start position:0%
um events that they plan at the library
 
06:07:22.798 --> 06:07:26.810 align:start position:0%
um events that they plan at the library
so

06:07:26.810 --> 06:07:26.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:28.910 --> 06:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
I knew that not nothing would come of
 
06:07:33.350 --> 06:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
this I spent time on the on the um
 
06:07:35.690 --> 06:07:35.700 align:start position:0%
on the Labor Commission prior to my time
 
06:07:37.850 --> 06:07:37.860 align:start position:0%
on the election law commission where I
 
06:07:39.048 --> 06:07:39.058 align:start position:0%
serve now
 
06:07:41.270 --> 06:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
and before that I was working in
 
06:07:43.368 --> 06:07:43.378 align:start position:0%
Industry I think I from the last time I
 
06:07:44.990 --> 06:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
talked I told you I was a machinist and
 
06:07:47.390 --> 06:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
I had worked in Industry so I couldn't
 
06:07:49.730 --> 06:07:49.740 align:start position:0%
see anything happen coming from this and
 
06:07:52.128 --> 06:07:52.138 align:start position:0%
nothing did come of it a few months
 
06:07:53.750 --> 06:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
later I was thinking about how much did
 
06:07:55.070 --> 06:07:55.080 align:start position:0%
that cost
 
06:07:59.750 --> 06:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
and I did a a 91a request of the
 
06:07:59.760 --> 06:08:00.350 align:start position:0%
and I did a a 91a request of the
um

06:08:00.350 --> 06:08:00.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:08:02.750 --> 06:08:02.760 align:start position:0%
information from Our Town Administrator
 
06:08:04.430 --> 06:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
and it was about fifty five hundred
 
06:08:06.110 --> 06:08:06.120 align:start position:0%
dollars one thing he mentioned to me
 
06:08:08.510 --> 06:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:10.610 --> 06:08:10.620 align:start position:0%
didn't sit well with me I'll say because
 
06:08:13.190 --> 06:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
it seemed to be a message he said he
 
06:08:15.170 --> 06:08:15.180 align:start position:0%
told me what the cost of the legal
 
06:08:17.030 --> 06:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
investigation was but then he added that
 
06:08:18.890 --> 06:08:18.900 align:start position:0%
it cost the town fifteen hundred dollars
 
06:08:21.170 --> 06:08:21.180 align:start position:0%
to comply with the 91a request that I
 
06:08:22.788 --> 06:08:22.798 align:start position:0%
made to find out how much this cost the
 
06:08:25.070 --> 06:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
town so in total about fifty five
 
06:08:26.330 --> 06:08:26.340 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars
 
06:08:26.340 --> 06:08:27.770 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars
and

06:08:27.770 --> 06:08:27.780 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:08:31.310 --> 06:08:31.320 align:start position:0%
that I would I would say that was um
 
06:08:32.930 --> 06:08:32.940 align:start position:0%
something that could have been stopped
 
06:08:35.570 --> 06:08:35.580 align:start position:0%
immediately if they had said we are
 
06:08:37.670 --> 06:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
investigating the library trustee and
 
06:08:40.190 --> 06:08:40.200 align:start position:0%
the library trustee could have come to
 
06:08:44.470 --> 06:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:47.570 --> 06:08:47.580 align:start position:0%
reminded the person who maybe had the
 
06:08:49.490 --> 06:08:49.500 align:start position:0%
wrong idea you know that's a generous
 
06:08:52.030 --> 06:08:52.040 align:start position:0%
way to phrase it maybe reminded that man
 
06:08:54.948 --> 06:08:54.958 align:start position:0%
that the library director canceled the
 
06:08:59.090 --> 06:08:59.100 align:start position:0%
program on her own and maybe the other
 
06:09:02.030 --> 06:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
uh Town Council Members did not have
 
06:09:03.530 --> 06:09:03.540 align:start position:0%
that information because that you know
 
06:09:04.970 --> 06:09:04.980 align:start position:0%
they're busy they can't go to Every
 
06:09:07.548 --> 06:09:07.558 align:start position:0%
meeting in town and I don't think that
 
06:09:10.070 --> 06:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
all any of the other ones were at the or
 
06:09:12.590 --> 06:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
maybe one was was at the library trustee
 
06:09:16.128 --> 06:09:16.138 align:start position:0%
uh meeting where that was said where the
 
06:09:19.010 --> 06:09:19.020 align:start position:0%
director said I have chosen to cancel
 
06:09:20.570 --> 06:09:20.580 align:start position:0%
the event on my own
 
06:09:22.430 --> 06:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
she was not bullied she was not forced
 
06:09:25.128 --> 06:09:25.138 align:start position:0%
there were no labor law violations okay
 
06:09:27.350 --> 06:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
that so that could have
 
06:09:29.930 --> 06:09:29.940 align:start position:0%
stopped at that point and we wouldn't
 
06:09:32.750 --> 06:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
have had to waste the town funds
 
06:09:35.270 --> 06:09:35.280 align:start position:0%
taxpayer funds on that
 
06:09:38.390 --> 06:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
and I think it's fair that someone have
 
06:09:42.048 --> 06:09:42.058 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to be there and say such
 
06:09:45.288 --> 06:09:45.298 align:start position:0%
important factual things if they are
 
06:09:48.288 --> 06:09:48.298 align:start position:0%
going to be investigated
 
06:09:50.448 --> 06:09:50.458 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
06:09:52.490 --> 06:09:52.500 align:start position:0%
I have some other
 
06:09:52.500 --> 06:09:53.628 align:start position:0%
I have some other
things

06:09:53.628 --> 06:09:53.638 align:start position:0%
things
 
06:09:56.150 --> 06:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
um well you did get this this paperwork
 
06:09:58.310 --> 06:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
but I will
 
06:10:00.890 --> 06:10:00.900 align:start position:0%
um read it for you as well
 
06:10:03.650 --> 06:10:03.660 align:start position:0%
the current 91a law does not include a
 
06:10:05.570 --> 06:10:05.580 align:start position:0%
requirement to notify a person who will
 
06:10:07.368 --> 06:10:07.378 align:start position:0%
be discussed during a non-public session
 
06:10:10.310 --> 06:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
a 48-hour notification requirement
 
06:10:12.770 --> 06:10:12.780 align:start position:0%
allows time for the notification to be
 
06:10:14.270 --> 06:10:14.280 align:start position:0%
delivered to the person so that they
 
06:10:15.770 --> 06:10:15.780 align:start position:0%
could decide to waive their right to
 
06:10:18.770 --> 06:10:18.780 align:start position:0%
attend attend with or without counsel or
 
06:10:21.530 --> 06:10:21.540 align:start position:0%
have the issue go to public meeting
 
06:10:23.570 --> 06:10:23.580 align:start position:0%
by denying a person's right to attend a
 
06:10:25.368 --> 06:10:25.378 align:start position:0%
non-public session when they will be the
 
06:10:27.230 --> 06:10:27.240 align:start position:0%
subject of discussion it does not live
 
06:10:30.590 --> 06:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
up to the purpose of the 91a law giving
 
06:10:32.330 --> 06:10:32.340 align:start position:0%
transparency to the person being
 
06:10:34.490 --> 06:10:34.500 align:start position:0%
discussed especially when minutes are
 
06:10:34.500 --> 06:10:35.868 align:start position:0%
discussed especially when minutes are
sealed

06:10:35.868 --> 06:10:35.878 align:start position:0%
sealed
 
06:10:38.090 --> 06:10:38.100 align:start position:0%
it gives a clear law to boards and
 
06:10:39.650 --> 06:10:39.660 align:start position:0%
committees that they must follow during
 
06:10:42.770 --> 06:10:42.780 align:start position:0%
their non-public procedures this bill is
 
06:10:45.048 --> 06:10:45.058 align:start position:0%
fair necessary and reasonable for the
 
06:10:47.150 --> 06:10:47.160 align:start position:0%
municipalities and more importantly the
 
06:10:48.770 --> 06:10:48.780 align:start position:0%
person being discussed in non-public
 
06:10:51.590 --> 06:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
sessions and their right to know costs
 
06:10:53.510 --> 06:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
would be minimal or may save the
 
06:10:55.610 --> 06:10:55.620 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money if the result of a
 
06:10:57.170 --> 06:10:57.180 align:start position:0%
non-public meeting didn't result in
 
06:10:59.628 --> 06:10:59.638 align:start position:0%
unnecessary investigations
 
06:11:01.970 --> 06:11:01.980 align:start position:0%
non-public meetings may or may not take
 
06:11:04.250 --> 06:11:04.260 align:start position:0%
longer to end but the benefit is to the
 
06:11:05.930 --> 06:11:05.940 align:start position:0%
persons who are notified to attend under
 
06:11:08.990 --> 06:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
the addition of the 91a law this law
 
06:11:10.868 --> 06:11:10.878 align:start position:0%
would not affect emergencies because
 
06:11:13.368 --> 06:11:13.378 align:start position:0%
administrators have the authority to
 
06:11:16.128 --> 06:11:16.138 align:start position:0%
make immediate decisions during an
 
06:11:18.770 --> 06:11:18.780 align:start position:0%
emergency in between board meetings I
 
06:11:25.190 --> 06:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:25.200 --> 06:11:28.190 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

06:11:28.190 --> 06:11:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:31.250 --> 06:11:31.260 align:start position:0%
so if that had been the situation in our
 
06:11:31.260 --> 06:11:32.510 align:start position:0%
so if that had been the situation in our
community

06:11:32.510 --> 06:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
community
 
06:11:34.670 --> 06:11:34.680 align:start position:0%
that would have saved money there may be
 
06:11:37.430 --> 06:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
some talk that you may hear some other
 
06:11:43.070 --> 06:11:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:46.548 --> 06:11:46.558 align:start position:0%
it's it's a notification it's a stamp
 
06:11:48.948 --> 06:11:48.958 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a half hour of work maybe
 
06:11:52.430 --> 06:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
for an administrative assistant it's the
 
06:11:58.070 --> 06:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
costs are not too much okay and
 
06:12:00.410 --> 06:12:00.420 align:start position:0%
I'll answer any questions if I can all
 
06:12:03.350 --> 06:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
right questions for this Witness
 
06:12:05.750 --> 06:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
yes representative greeson
 
06:12:07.010 --> 06:12:07.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
06:12:08.990 --> 06:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
representative I'm uh just a little
 
06:12:10.788 --> 06:12:10.798 align:start position:0%
clarification on the language and the
 
06:12:13.850 --> 06:12:13.860 align:start position:0%
bill that says that the
 
06:12:15.770 --> 06:12:15.780 align:start position:0%
the person whose reputation may be
 
06:12:17.930 --> 06:12:17.940 align:start position:0%
adversely affected shall be notified in
 
06:12:20.448 --> 06:12:20.458 align:start position:0%
writing at least 48 hours prior to the
 
06:12:22.730 --> 06:12:22.740 align:start position:0%
non-public session provided that
 
06:12:24.948 --> 06:12:24.958 align:start position:0%
notifications may be waived upon written
 
06:12:27.890 --> 06:12:27.900 align:start position:0%
agreement of the parties and I'm I'm
 
06:12:27.900 --> 06:12:29.510 align:start position:0%
agreement of the parties and I'm I'm
wondering

06:12:29.510 --> 06:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
06:12:33.110 --> 06:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
how do you wave who's waving the
 
06:12:35.090 --> 06:12:35.100 align:start position:0%
notification and where is this written
 
06:12:37.010 --> 06:12:37.020 align:start position:0%
agreement of the parties which parties
 
06:12:39.708 --> 06:12:39.718 align:start position:0%
that's just a little bit confusing to me
 
06:12:43.390 --> 06:12:43.400 align:start position:0%
and it may just be post
 
06:12:46.970 --> 06:12:46.980 align:start position:0%
testimony syndrome
 
06:12:49.070 --> 06:12:49.080 align:start position:0%
okay I think that would apply to the
 
06:12:50.810 --> 06:12:50.820 align:start position:0%
person who receives the letter that they
 
06:12:52.190 --> 06:12:52.200 align:start position:0%
if they wanted to waive it they could
 
06:12:52.200 --> 06:12:53.090 align:start position:0%
if they wanted to waive it they could
just

06:12:53.090 --> 06:12:53.100 align:start position:0%
just
 
06:12:56.448 --> 06:12:56.458 align:start position:0%
write in saying I wave my
 
06:12:58.730 --> 06:12:58.740 align:start position:0%
I don't care to attend
 
06:13:00.170 --> 06:13:00.180 align:start position:0%
yeah are there other questions for this
 
06:13:03.890 --> 06:13:03.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:06.350 --> 06:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
maybe I'll have to go back and
 
06:13:08.330 --> 06:13:08.340 align:start position:0%
see the YouTube stream because I think I
 
06:13:09.470 --> 06:13:09.480 align:start position:0%
missed the first couple of minutes here
 
06:13:11.810 --> 06:13:11.820 align:start position:0%
testimony but what was the nature who's
 
06:13:13.490 --> 06:13:13.500 align:start position:0%
offended the library what was his whole
 
06:13:15.948 --> 06:13:15.958 align:start position:0%
underlying controversy about if if
 
06:13:19.010 --> 06:13:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:21.770 --> 06:13:21.780 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I sometimes have some a hard
 
06:13:23.750 --> 06:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
time hearing what was the whole
 
06:13:25.730 --> 06:13:25.740 align:start position:0%
underlying controversy about and what
 
06:13:28.010 --> 06:13:28.020 align:start position:0%
was the event in question the
 
06:13:29.990 --> 06:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
controversy is actually quite secondary
 
06:13:33.470 --> 06:13:33.480 align:start position:0%
to this issue but it was pretty much the
 
06:13:34.910 --> 06:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
only controversy that you hear about
 
06:13:37.070 --> 06:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
with libraries recently and that would
 
06:13:41.510 --> 06:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
be uh drag performer story times and
 
06:13:44.208 --> 06:13:44.218 align:start position:0%
that was controversial in my community
 
06:13:46.310 --> 06:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
other questions for this witness
 
06:13:48.350 --> 06:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
um I could see potentially if
 
06:13:50.750 --> 06:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
I can see potentially if there was a
 
06:13:53.690 --> 06:13:53.700 align:start position:0%
drag queen Story Hour that both the dry
 
06:13:55.430 --> 06:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
queens and whoever objected the drag
 
06:13:57.708 --> 06:13:57.718 align:start position:0%
communities can both feel good is there
 
06:13:59.570 --> 06:13:59.580 align:start position:0%
okay maybe that's not fair but what do
 
06:14:01.610 --> 06:14:01.620 align:start position:0%
you do in a situation where
 
06:14:03.890 --> 06:14:03.900 align:start position:0%
both parties in the dispute feel that
 
06:14:06.110 --> 06:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
their uh reputations are being sullied
 
06:14:06.120 --> 06:14:07.670 align:start position:0%
their uh reputations are being sullied
because

06:14:07.670 --> 06:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
because
 
06:14:09.830 --> 06:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
there was only one
 
06:14:12.890 --> 06:14:12.900 align:start position:0%
person that was well two people that
 
06:14:15.410 --> 06:14:15.420 align:start position:0%
would be the library trustee and myself
 
06:14:18.110 --> 06:14:18.120 align:start position:0%
that would have been discussed during
 
06:14:21.530 --> 06:14:21.540 align:start position:0%
non-public session I assume because we
 
06:14:22.788 --> 06:14:22.798 align:start position:0%
were the only ones that got the phone
 
06:14:25.010 --> 06:14:25.020 align:start position:0%
calls asking us for information about it
 
06:14:29.868 --> 06:14:29.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:32.570 --> 06:14:32.580 align:start position:0%
sure I suppose but they have the right
 
06:14:34.788 --> 06:14:34.798 align:start position:0%
to speak publicly on that and discuss it
 
06:14:36.170 --> 06:14:36.180 align:start position:0%
if they want to but they were not
 
06:14:38.510 --> 06:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
investigated by the Town Council
 
06:14:41.570 --> 06:14:41.580 align:start position:0%
other questions for this Witness
 
06:14:43.850 --> 06:14:43.860 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
06:14:46.930 --> 06:14:46.940 align:start position:0%
yep thanks Mr chairman and thanks again
 
06:14:49.368 --> 06:14:49.378 align:start position:0%
uh presenting
 
06:14:49.378 --> 06:14:50.030 align:start position:0%
uh presenting
um

06:14:50.030 --> 06:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:14:52.910 --> 06:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm wondering rather than just
 
06:14:55.250 --> 06:14:55.260 align:start position:0%
the notification requirement which is
 
06:14:56.810 --> 06:14:56.820 align:start position:0%
sort of what I think you had focused on
 
06:14:59.570 --> 06:14:59.580 align:start position:0%
I guess one of the questions is the
 
06:15:02.208 --> 06:15:02.218 align:start position:0%
concept of bringing in counsel to
 
06:15:05.510 --> 06:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
represent the individual in
 
06:15:07.850 --> 06:15:07.860 align:start position:0%
um what I understand and again excuse me
 
06:15:09.170 --> 06:15:09.180 align:start position:0%
for not knowing everything about how
 
06:15:11.390 --> 06:15:11.400 align:start position:0%
non-public session Works
 
06:15:14.208 --> 06:15:14.218 align:start position:0%
um deliberation of a board you know for
 
06:15:16.250 --> 06:15:16.260 align:start position:0%
their own decision-making process rather
 
06:15:20.990 --> 06:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
than sort of a what I wonder might seem
 
06:15:23.570 --> 06:15:23.580 align:start position:0%
more like you know a trial
 
06:15:27.170 --> 06:15:27.180 align:start position:0%
sure it's not a trial uh but I I recall
 
06:15:28.850 --> 06:15:28.860 align:start position:0%
the first time that I was ever asked to
 
06:15:31.570 --> 06:15:31.580 align:start position:0%
be on National Television I was nervous
 
06:15:34.788 --> 06:15:34.798 align:start position:0%
and I asked someone who was a lawyer to
 
06:15:37.430 --> 06:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
to come with me
 
06:15:39.048 --> 06:15:39.058 align:start position:0%
it just made me more comfortable to be
 
06:15:40.128 --> 06:15:40.138 align:start position:0%
able to
 
06:15:43.670 --> 06:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
look at them to communicate with them to
 
06:15:46.190 --> 06:15:46.200 align:start position:0%
ask questions if necessary as the
 
06:15:48.110 --> 06:15:48.120 align:start position:0%
process unfolded and that may be the
 
06:15:50.810 --> 06:15:50.820 align:start position:0%
same for someone else who even though
 
06:15:53.690 --> 06:15:53.700 align:start position:0%
this is not being being interviewed in
 
06:15:55.190 --> 06:15:55.200 align:start position:0%
the media this may be something that
 
06:15:57.590 --> 06:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
makes them it would make them much more
 
06:15:59.208 --> 06:15:59.218 align:start position:0%
comfortable to have
 
06:16:01.670 --> 06:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
legal counsel there can ask one quick
 
06:16:03.770 --> 06:16:03.780 align:start position:0%
follow-up yeah
 
06:16:06.230 --> 06:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
do you get the sense that that would
 
06:16:08.390 --> 06:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
perhaps necessitate the town to then
 
06:16:10.788 --> 06:16:10.798 align:start position:0%
bring in their Town Council
 
06:16:12.948 --> 06:16:12.958 align:start position:0%
um but in order to be uneven footing if
 
06:16:14.510 --> 06:16:14.520 align:start position:0%
if there's going to be sort of a legal
 
06:16:14.520 --> 06:16:16.788 align:start position:0%
if there's going to be sort of a legal
component

06:16:16.788 --> 06:16:16.798 align:start position:0%
component
 
06:16:19.670 --> 06:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
some Town counselors May interpret it
 
06:16:21.650 --> 06:16:21.660 align:start position:0%
that way and that's for them to
 
06:16:24.230 --> 06:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
interpret that's that's for them
 
06:16:27.110 --> 06:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
are there questions for this Witness
 
06:16:29.930 --> 06:16:29.940 align:start position:0%
so I guess I have a question um I'm
 
06:16:33.350 --> 06:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
concerned so suppose that this is the
 
06:16:33.360 --> 06:16:34.610 align:start position:0%
concerned so suppose that this is the
situation

06:16:34.610 --> 06:16:34.620 align:start position:0%
situation
 
06:16:38.150 --> 06:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
that the sport of Selectmen is planning
 
06:16:40.430 --> 06:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
to hold a meeting tonight let's just say
 
06:16:42.410 --> 06:16:42.420 align:start position:0%
hypothetically the border selectment is
 
06:16:44.628 --> 06:16:44.638 align:start position:0%
holding a meeting tonight
 
06:16:48.350 --> 06:16:48.360 align:start position:0%
someone in the planning department
 
06:16:51.110 --> 06:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
um wants to come in
 
06:16:55.910 --> 06:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh to the board of Selectmen uh because
 
06:16:58.850 --> 06:16:58.860 align:start position:0%
that person is concerned that
 
06:17:01.610 --> 06:17:01.620 align:start position:0%
his boss or her boss the head of the
 
06:17:03.410 --> 06:17:03.420 align:start position:0%
planning department has been stealing
 
06:17:05.270 --> 06:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
money from the town
 
06:17:07.490 --> 06:17:07.500 align:start position:0%
uh and the board wants to go into
 
06:17:09.110 --> 06:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
06:17:11.628 --> 06:17:11.638 align:start position:0%
to to get some information about that
 
06:17:14.510 --> 06:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
you would seem to be saying that the
 
06:17:17.750 --> 06:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
board would have to notify
 
06:17:21.048 --> 06:17:21.058 align:start position:0%
what arguably would be the target of the
 
06:17:23.208 --> 06:17:23.218 align:start position:0%
investigation that the person is being
 
06:17:26.448 --> 06:17:26.458 align:start position:0%
investigated is that because I could see
 
06:17:29.090 --> 06:17:29.100 align:start position:0%
a lot of problems with doing it
 
06:17:30.890 --> 06:17:30.900 align:start position:0%
I think if you're the target of such
 
06:17:33.590 --> 06:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
investigation you either know it or you
 
06:17:36.770 --> 06:17:36.780 align:start position:0%
want to defend that that's not the case
 
06:17:38.330 --> 06:17:38.340 align:start position:0%
there are two options to that it's
 
06:17:41.810 --> 06:17:41.820 align:start position:0%
either true and you're aware of it or
 
06:17:44.390 --> 06:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
you're being falsely charged with that
 
06:17:46.070 --> 06:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
and you would like to say something
 
06:17:47.570 --> 06:17:47.580 align:start position:0%
about that you may have more information
 
06:17:49.730 --> 06:17:49.740 align:start position:0%
to add at that time that you would like
 
06:17:51.708 --> 06:17:51.718 align:start position:0%
to do well sure but I mean and certainly
 
06:17:53.628 --> 06:17:53.638 align:start position:0%
I would agree with you at some point I
 
06:17:55.070 --> 06:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
mean if the person is going to be
 
06:17:56.930 --> 06:17:56.940 align:start position:0%
charged or going to be fired or
 
06:17:59.390 --> 06:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
something like that sure that person I
 
06:18:03.070 --> 06:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
agree would but this seems to say
 
06:18:07.310 --> 06:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
anytime so that would I mean that would
 
06:18:07.320 --> 06:18:08.208 align:start position:0%
anytime so that would I mean that would
mean

06:18:08.208 --> 06:18:08.218 align:start position:0%
mean
 
06:18:08.218 --> 06:18:09.830 align:start position:0%
mean
that

06:18:09.830 --> 06:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:18:12.470 --> 06:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
you could have to disclose information
 
06:18:14.570 --> 06:18:14.580 align:start position:0%
that would allow
 
06:18:18.230 --> 06:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
the Target in my hypothetical to do
 
06:18:21.890 --> 06:18:21.900 align:start position:0%
something to cover up or whatever or uh
 
06:18:24.110 --> 06:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
you know that so why why would that make
 
06:18:24.120 --> 06:18:25.910 align:start position:0%
you know that so why why would that make
sense

06:18:25.910 --> 06:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
sense
 
06:18:27.830 --> 06:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
I haven't been involved in a lot of
 
06:18:30.890 --> 06:18:30.900 align:start position:0%
those sorts of situations but just a few
 
06:18:34.610 --> 06:18:34.620 align:start position:0%
and when that was the case uh the par
 
06:18:37.070 --> 06:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
the the target of that investigation
 
06:18:37.080 --> 06:18:38.150 align:start position:0%
the the target of that investigation
knew

06:18:38.150 --> 06:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
knew
 
06:18:41.448 --> 06:18:41.458 align:start position:0%
and new because in a small environment
 
06:18:44.270 --> 06:18:44.280 align:start position:0%
they they know and it was either I don't
 
06:18:46.190 --> 06:18:46.200 align:start position:0%
recall what the what the outcome was
 
06:18:47.810 --> 06:18:47.820 align:start position:0%
because I left that board but it was
 
06:18:50.570 --> 06:18:50.580 align:start position:0%
either true or not true and I I
 
06:18:52.788 --> 06:18:52.798 align:start position:0%
think that people have a right to say
 
06:18:54.230 --> 06:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
something about it
 
06:18:56.628 --> 06:18:56.638 align:start position:0%
okay so let me just give I'm just I'm
 
06:18:59.030 --> 06:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
because I'm I'm very concerned about
 
06:19:02.270 --> 06:19:02.280 align:start position:0%
this so let's suppose in my hypothetical
 
06:19:05.868 --> 06:19:05.878 align:start position:0%
the the planning board employee goes to
 
06:19:09.048 --> 06:19:09.058 align:start position:0%
the selectman's meeting and says
 
06:19:11.330 --> 06:19:11.340 align:start position:0%
tomorrow night
 
06:19:14.510 --> 06:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
I have information that the director of
 
06:19:16.970 --> 06:19:16.980 align:start position:0%
the planning department is going to meet
 
06:19:19.010 --> 06:19:19.020 align:start position:0%
with developer X
 
06:19:21.650 --> 06:19:21.660 align:start position:0%
and developer X is going to give
 
06:19:23.510 --> 06:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
the the director of the planning
 
06:19:23.520 --> 06:19:24.890 align:start position:0%
the the director of the planning
department

06:19:24.890 --> 06:19:24.900 align:start position:0%
department
 
06:19:27.770 --> 06:19:27.780 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollars in the hopes that
 
06:19:30.350 --> 06:19:30.360 align:start position:0%
the planning department will approve uh
 
06:19:32.330 --> 06:19:32.340 align:start position:0%
the development that this developer has
 
06:19:34.610 --> 06:19:34.620 align:start position:0%
before the planning department
 
06:19:37.990 --> 06:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
um what do I do Mr selectman about this
 
06:19:41.330 --> 06:19:41.340 align:start position:0%
under your bill you would say that
 
06:19:43.128 --> 06:19:43.138 align:start position:0%
they could not have that meeting in
 
06:19:45.230 --> 06:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
private they would have to they'd have
 
06:19:47.390 --> 06:19:47.400 align:start position:0%
to notify the planning director by the
 
06:19:47.400 --> 06:19:48.410 align:start position:0%
to notify the planning director by the
way

06:19:48.410 --> 06:19:48.420 align:start position:0%
way
 
06:19:50.930 --> 06:19:50.940 align:start position:0%
um we you know there's going to be claim
 
06:19:52.368 --> 06:19:52.378 align:start position:0%
that you're getting a bribe tomorrow
 
06:19:54.610 --> 06:19:54.620 align:start position:0%
night uh
 
06:19:56.868 --> 06:19:56.878 align:start position:0%
obviously what you know that's that's
 
06:19:59.330 --> 06:19:59.340 align:start position:0%
the end of of any evidence of that
 
06:20:01.670 --> 06:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
happen so how does that that's what
 
06:20:05.868 --> 06:20:05.878 align:start position:0%
concerns me okay thank you
 
06:20:20.170 --> 06:20:20.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:23.330 --> 06:20:23.340 align:start position:0%
don't be pretty I'm sorry can you turn
 
06:20:24.830 --> 06:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
up your
 
06:20:28.070 --> 06:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:30.948 --> 06:20:30.958 align:start position:0%
to clarify I do not believe that that
 
06:20:34.128 --> 06:20:34.138 align:start position:0%
situation would happen in the fact that
 
06:20:36.530 --> 06:20:36.540 align:start position:0%
I know it's not part of the process I
 
06:20:40.190 --> 06:20:40.200 align:start position:0%
know in my town the any complaint like
 
06:20:43.070 --> 06:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
that needs to first go to the town
 
06:20:46.190 --> 06:20:46.200 align:start position:0%
manager and then the town manager once
 
06:20:48.350 --> 06:20:48.360 align:start position:0%
verified or investigated or whatever he
 
06:20:51.590 --> 06:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
would do would then bring it to the Town
 
06:20:55.190 --> 06:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
Council so I think a step is missing in
 
06:20:57.530 --> 06:20:57.540 align:start position:0%
trying to do that
 
06:20:59.510 --> 06:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
um so that I don't think that type of
 
06:21:01.190 --> 06:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
thing would happen under these
 
06:21:02.690 --> 06:21:02.700 align:start position:0%
circumstances I think that's the same
 
06:21:04.490 --> 06:21:04.500 align:start position:0%
process that you have in your town with
 
06:21:06.170 --> 06:21:06.180 align:start position:0%
the town manager so
 
06:21:08.628 --> 06:21:08.638 align:start position:0%
that is not something that I have a
 
06:21:12.110 --> 06:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of experience with so
 
06:21:12.120 --> 06:21:13.490 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of experience with so
I

06:21:13.490 --> 06:21:13.500 align:start position:0%
I
 
06:21:16.010 --> 06:21:16.020 align:start position:0%
I mean I guess thank you for the
 
06:21:18.170 --> 06:21:18.180 align:start position:0%
question I I guess the thing that I'm
 
06:21:21.170 --> 06:21:21.180 align:start position:0%
concerned about is this seems to say
 
06:21:24.110 --> 06:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
that there can be no if you're going to
 
06:21:24.120 --> 06:21:25.250 align:start position:0%
that there can be no if you're going to
be

06:21:25.250 --> 06:21:25.260 align:start position:0%
be
 
06:21:29.030 --> 06:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
talking about something that adversely
 
06:21:30.948 --> 06:21:30.958 align:start position:0%
affects someone
 
06:21:33.948 --> 06:21:33.958 align:start position:0%
under all circumstances you have to let
 
06:21:35.750 --> 06:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
the person know and it just seems to me
 
06:21:38.090 --> 06:21:38.100 align:start position:0%
that that's awfully broad because I can
 
06:21:41.990 --> 06:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
imagine a number of circumstances in
 
06:21:44.770 --> 06:21:44.780 align:start position:0%
which it would be appropriate for
 
06:21:47.448 --> 06:21:47.458 align:start position:0%
Boards of various kinds to be talking
 
06:21:47.458 --> 06:21:48.590 align:start position:0%
Boards of various kinds to be talking
about

06:21:48.590 --> 06:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
about
 
06:21:51.288 --> 06:21:51.298 align:start position:0%
something that would adversely affect
 
06:21:53.270 --> 06:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
someone that if you told that person
 
06:21:55.970 --> 06:21:55.980 align:start position:0%
about it it would undermine important
 
06:21:55.980 --> 06:21:57.470 align:start position:0%
about it it would undermine important
objectives

06:21:57.470 --> 06:21:57.480 align:start position:0%
objectives
 
06:21:59.990 --> 06:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
that you know that that the board could
 
06:22:04.490 --> 06:22:04.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:06.230 --> 06:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
one of the things that also happened in
 
06:22:08.048 --> 06:22:08.058 align:start position:0%
this case
 
06:22:10.190 --> 06:22:10.200 align:start position:0%
was um
 
06:22:12.288 --> 06:22:12.298 align:start position:0%
at the Town council meeting when I
 
06:22:15.890 --> 06:22:15.900 align:start position:0%
explained my my side of the story
 
06:22:18.410 --> 06:22:18.420 align:start position:0%
and when it was it was quite
 
06:22:18.420 --> 06:22:19.548 align:start position:0%
and when it was it was quite
controversial

06:22:19.548 --> 06:22:19.558 align:start position:0%
controversial
 
06:22:23.990 --> 06:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
was I explained my side of the story
 
06:22:28.368 --> 06:22:28.378 align:start position:0%
and after that the town counselor said
 
06:22:31.070 --> 06:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
that he was going to be exploring legal
 
06:22:32.868 --> 06:22:32.878 align:start position:0%
ways that the town could address the
 
06:22:34.730 --> 06:22:34.740 align:start position:0%
issue and I just thought I don't know
 
06:22:36.708 --> 06:22:36.718 align:start position:0%
what he's talking about what it what
 
06:22:39.350 --> 06:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
what issue there's nothing that would
 
06:22:41.810 --> 06:22:41.820 align:start position:0%
need any legal
 
06:22:45.470 --> 06:22:45.480 align:start position:0%
work to address and I didn't think much
 
06:22:47.810 --> 06:22:47.820 align:start position:0%
of it beyond that until I got the phone
 
06:22:51.708 --> 06:22:51.718 align:start position:0%
call from the legal firm investigating
 
06:22:55.128 --> 06:22:55.138 align:start position:0%
other questions for this Witness
 
06:22:57.770 --> 06:22:57.780 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you very much next I'm
 
06:23:02.990 --> 06:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
going to call on Lorraine uh lindenberg
 
06:23:03.000 --> 06:23:08.750 align:start position:0%
going to call on Lorraine uh lindenberg
right

06:23:08.750 --> 06:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:12.350 --> 06:23:12.360 align:start position:0%
uh thank you very much Mr chairman and
 
06:23:14.750 --> 06:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I'm Lorraine
 
06:23:17.448 --> 06:23:17.458 align:start position:0%
lindenberg from Derry I'm also a member
 
06:23:19.490 --> 06:23:19.500 align:start position:0%
of right to know New Hampshire
 
06:23:25.150 --> 06:23:25.160 align:start position:0%
and I am in support of HB
 
06:23:28.730 --> 06:23:28.740 align:start position:0%
652 FN I believe
 
06:23:32.810 --> 06:23:32.820 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the 91a law is the to
 
06:23:35.270 --> 06:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
provide transparency in our government
 
06:23:38.510 --> 06:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
to the people of New Hampshire
 
06:23:42.170 --> 06:23:42.180 align:start position:0%
the current 91a law has no mandatory
 
06:23:45.110 --> 06:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
requirement but notifying an individual
 
06:23:47.810 --> 06:23:47.820 align:start position:0%
within a period of time
 
06:23:50.448 --> 06:23:50.458 align:start position:0%
to the of the person who's going to be
 
06:23:52.850 --> 06:23:52.860 align:start position:0%
discussing in that public session
 
06:23:56.990 --> 06:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
the 48-hour required notification would
 
06:23:59.810 --> 06:23:59.820 align:start position:0%
allow the individual or employee enough
 
06:24:02.270 --> 06:24:02.280 align:start position:0%
time to decide if they want to attend
 
06:24:05.030 --> 06:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
with or without counsel waive their
 
06:24:09.430 --> 06:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
right to attend or have their uh
 
06:24:12.948 --> 06:24:12.958 align:start position:0%
discussion in open public session
 
06:24:15.770 --> 06:24:15.780 align:start position:0%
if the public body does not notify an
 
06:24:18.708 --> 06:24:18.718 align:start position:0%
individual or gives a little time to
 
06:24:21.708 --> 06:24:21.718 align:start position:0%
attend and prepare it denies that
 
06:24:24.948 --> 06:24:24.958 align:start position:0%
individual their right to attend to hear
 
06:24:28.070 --> 06:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
what's being discussed about them and to
 
06:24:30.470 --> 06:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
advocate for themselves
 
06:24:33.650 --> 06:24:33.660 align:start position:0%
I was not notified to attend a
 
06:24:36.410 --> 06:24:36.420 align:start position:0%
non-public meeting where I was the
 
06:24:39.048 --> 06:24:39.058 align:start position:0%
subject of discussion and the reputation
 
06:24:41.570 --> 06:24:41.580 align:start position:0%
of an employee was falsely used
 
06:24:44.868 --> 06:24:44.878 align:start position:0%
even though the employee was never the
 
06:24:47.150 --> 06:24:47.160 align:start position:0%
subject of the discussion
 
06:24:51.048 --> 06:24:51.058 align:start position:0%
the employee was not notified either
 
06:24:54.530 --> 06:24:54.540 align:start position:0%
counselors only needed a simple majority
 
06:24:57.708 --> 06:24:57.718 align:start position:0%
to do a town investigation against me
 
06:25:01.250 --> 06:25:01.260 align:start position:0%
if I had had the right to attend that
 
06:25:05.868 --> 06:25:05.878 align:start position:0%
meeting or the employee had been
 
06:25:07.850 --> 06:25:07.860 align:start position:0%
notified to attend
 
06:25:10.128 --> 06:25:10.138 align:start position:0%
that child investigation would never
 
06:25:13.430 --> 06:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
have been approved and the waste of
 
06:25:16.368 --> 06:25:16.378 align:start position:0%
almost six thousand dollars of taxpayer
 
06:25:19.430 --> 06:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
money would never have been spent
 
06:25:22.430 --> 06:25:22.440 align:start position:0%
because there is no law requiring boards
 
06:25:25.548 --> 06:25:25.558 align:start position:0%
and Company committees to notify people
 
06:25:28.670 --> 06:25:28.680 align:start position:0%
who will be the topic of discussion
 
06:25:31.610 --> 06:25:31.620 align:start position:0%
during public meetings my town and I'm
 
06:25:34.490 --> 06:25:34.500 align:start position:0%
sure other towns Villages and cities
 
06:25:37.850 --> 06:25:37.860 align:start position:0%
have not notified to individuals who are
 
06:25:40.970 --> 06:25:40.980 align:start position:0%
subject of the non-public meetings
 
06:25:43.670 --> 06:25:43.680 align:start position:0%
non-public meetings may take a little
 
06:25:43.680 --> 06:25:44.930 align:start position:0%
non-public meetings may take a little
longer

06:25:44.930 --> 06:25:44.940 align:start position:0%
longer
 
06:25:46.910 --> 06:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
but isn't it worse
 
06:25:50.868 --> 06:25:50.878 align:start position:0%
the time if a person being discussed has
 
06:25:52.670 --> 06:25:52.680 align:start position:0%
the right to attend
 
06:25:54.530 --> 06:25:54.540 align:start position:0%
hear what's being said about them
 
06:25:58.128 --> 06:25:58.138 align:start position:0%
decisions that are being made about them
 
06:26:01.850 --> 06:26:01.860 align:start position:0%
and be able to advocate for themselves
 
06:26:04.670 --> 06:26:04.680 align:start position:0%
the costs to municipalities would be
 
06:26:07.128 --> 06:26:07.138 align:start position:0%
minimal but the benefits of the public
 
06:26:09.048 --> 06:26:09.058 align:start position:0%
would be enormous
 
06:26:12.650 --> 06:26:12.660 align:start position:0%
if this bill is passing to law it might
 
06:26:15.830 --> 06:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
even save the taxpayers money like it
 
06:26:18.350 --> 06:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
would have in my case
 
06:26:18.360 --> 06:26:20.288 align:start position:0%
would have in my case
that

06:26:20.288 --> 06:26:20.298 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:26:23.090 --> 06:26:23.100 align:start position:0%
across the taxpayers almost six thousand
 
06:26:25.788 --> 06:26:25.798 align:start position:0%
dollars for a town investigation that
 
06:26:27.590 --> 06:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
should never have happened and wouldn't
 
06:26:29.930 --> 06:26:29.940 align:start position:0%
have happened had I been there to
 
06:26:32.390 --> 06:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
advocate for myself
 
06:26:38.750 --> 06:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
HB 652 is fair necessary and reasonable
 
06:26:40.610 --> 06:26:40.620 align:start position:0%
to the people of New Hampshire for
 
06:26:43.310 --> 06:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
transparency in their government
 
06:26:46.970 --> 06:26:46.980 align:start position:0%
HB 652
 
06:26:50.448 --> 06:26:50.458 align:start position:0%
if passed it's a law will provide a
 
06:26:52.430 --> 06:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
clear law to our public bodies and
 
06:26:54.170 --> 06:26:54.180 align:start position:0%
committees pertaining to the
 
06:26:56.810 --> 06:26:56.820 align:start position:0%
notification requirements and it will
 
06:26:59.868 --> 06:26:59.878 align:start position:0%
protect the Public's right to hear what
 
06:27:01.850 --> 06:27:01.860 align:start position:0%
is being discussed about them behind
 
06:27:04.610 --> 06:27:04.620 align:start position:0%
closed doors and they can advocate for
 
06:27:10.368 --> 06:27:10.378 align:start position:0%
themselves I ask you to move HB 652 FN
 
06:27:12.890 --> 06:27:12.900 align:start position:0%
to the Full House and recommend ought to
 
06:27:15.470 --> 06:27:15.480 align:start position:0%

okay so I was arrested and prevented
 
06:28:56.090 --> 06:28:56.100 align:start position:0%
from uh attending a closed session and I
 
06:28:58.070 --> 06:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
was told by the chief of police this is
 
06:28:59.930 --> 06:28:59.940 align:start position:0%
small town politics
 
06:29:02.628 --> 06:29:02.638 align:start position:0%
okay and after that happened I spent two
 
06:29:04.310 --> 06:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
years in the law library the New
 
06:29:05.708 --> 06:29:05.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court Law Library
 
06:29:07.910 --> 06:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
studying law meeting Supreme Court
 
06:29:10.430 --> 06:29:10.440 align:start position:0%
rulings I found a lot of good wisdom in
 
06:29:11.810 --> 06:29:11.820 align:start position:0%
those things
 
06:29:15.530 --> 06:29:15.540 align:start position:0%
and in that time I also sat there
 
06:29:18.048 --> 06:29:18.058 align:start position:0%
and I was able to hear Joseph
 
06:29:20.448 --> 06:29:20.458 align:start position:0%
or Justice Joseph NATO when he came back
 
06:29:22.670 --> 06:29:22.680 align:start position:0%
from Iraq helping them write the
 
06:29:25.548 --> 06:29:25.558 align:start position:0%
Constitution and his remarks there was
 
06:29:29.090 --> 06:29:29.100 align:start position:0%
the people in Iraq look at judges as
 
06:29:32.810 --> 06:29:32.820 align:start position:0%
Saints because they are the only thing
 
06:29:36.048 --> 06:29:36.058 align:start position:0%
between an oppressive government
 
06:29:37.910 --> 06:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
and the people
 
06:29:40.250 --> 06:29:40.260 align:start position:0%
and Justin Dugan sat there with his head
 
06:29:40.260 --> 06:29:41.208 align:start position:0%
and Justin Dugan sat there with his head
proud

06:29:41.208 --> 06:29:41.218 align:start position:0%
proud
 
06:29:44.090 --> 06:29:44.100 align:start position:0%
and they do deserve that proudness I do
 
06:29:46.368 --> 06:29:46.378 align:start position:0%
say the same thing for lawmakers
 
06:29:48.948 --> 06:29:48.958 align:start position:0%
I mean we're not as Extreme as Iraq with
 
06:29:51.948 --> 06:29:51.958 align:start position:0%
a person has a chance of being killed if
 
06:29:53.868 --> 06:29:53.878 align:start position:0%
they oppose the dictator
 
06:29:56.090 --> 06:29:56.100 align:start position:0%
but you are spending a lot of your time
 
06:29:58.610 --> 06:29:58.620 align:start position:0%
you listen a lot of these testimonies
 
06:30:00.590 --> 06:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
I've sat here with you by yourself the
 
06:30:02.930 --> 06:30:02.940 align:start position:0%
last couple days I mean there's a lot of
 
06:30:05.690 --> 06:30:05.700 align:start position:0%
issues here it affects us
 
06:30:07.610 --> 06:30:07.620 align:start position:0%
so with that
 
06:30:09.530 --> 06:30:09.540 align:start position:0%
I want you know that's why I
 
06:30:12.650 --> 06:30:12.660 align:start position:0%
complimented you Justin Lynn and I'd
 
06:30:14.390 --> 06:30:14.400 align:start position:0%
like to answer your question also
 
06:30:17.448 --> 06:30:17.458 align:start position:0%
because it was a good point
 
06:30:19.430 --> 06:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
in my testimony
 
06:30:22.010 --> 06:30:22.020 align:start position:0%
supre versus bulldog
 
06:30:25.548 --> 06:30:25.558 align:start position:0%
the courts had cleared clearly stated
 
06:30:28.910 --> 06:30:28.920 align:start position:0%
that the zba or the Zoning Board of
 
06:30:31.548 --> 06:30:31.558 align:start position:0%
adjustments is acting a quasi-judicial
 
06:30:34.850 --> 06:30:34.860 align:start position:0%
role so in that particular case as you
 
06:30:37.788 --> 06:30:37.798 align:start position:0%
were presenting your honor that if a
 
06:30:40.490 --> 06:30:40.500 align:start position:0%
person suspects somebody of accepting a
 
06:30:40.500 --> 06:30:41.330 align:start position:0%
person suspects somebody of accepting a
bribe

06:30:41.330 --> 06:30:41.340 align:start position:0%
bribe
 
06:30:43.010 --> 06:30:43.020 align:start position:0%
well they should be contacting law
 
06:30:44.690 --> 06:30:44.700 align:start position:0%
enforcement so they can investigate and
 
06:30:46.070 --> 06:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
catch the person
 
06:30:48.170 --> 06:30:48.180 align:start position:0%
number two if they have evidence that
 
06:30:50.270 --> 06:30:50.280 align:start position:0%
this has happened well then they should
 
06:30:52.850 --> 06:30:52.860 align:start position:0%
be writing a form submitting it to the
 
06:30:54.708 --> 06:30:54.718 align:start position:0%
person which is regular judicial
 
06:30:57.350 --> 06:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
procedures then they can present that
 
06:30:59.690 --> 06:30:59.700 align:start position:0%
complaint to the person and then both
 
06:31:02.270 --> 06:31:02.280 align:start position:0%
parties can come to the meeting that's
 
06:31:04.190 --> 06:31:04.200 align:start position:0%
why you would want notice so now he can
 
06:31:05.448 --> 06:31:05.458 align:start position:0%
defend himself
 
06:31:07.430 --> 06:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
and so I hope that the economy answers
 
06:31:08.750 --> 06:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
your question because you're kind of
 
06:31:11.690 --> 06:31:11.700 align:start position:0%
running into the quasi-judicial area on
 
06:31:13.788 --> 06:31:13.798 align:start position:0%
which procedural rules you should be
 
06:31:16.368 --> 06:31:16.378 align:start position:0%
following in those cases
 
06:31:19.368 --> 06:31:19.378 align:start position:0%
the other thing is I'd like to say is
 
06:31:23.208 --> 06:31:23.218 align:start position:0%
the people you know or I've been told by
 
06:31:23.218 --> 06:31:24.770 align:start position:0%
the people you know or I've been told by
Representatives

06:31:24.770 --> 06:31:24.780 align:start position:0%
Representatives
 
06:31:26.868 --> 06:31:26.878 align:start position:0%
that this statue doesn't need to be
 
06:31:29.868 --> 06:31:29.878 align:start position:0%
clear or clarified it's very
 
06:31:29.878 --> 06:31:31.490 align:start position:0%
clear or clarified it's very
straightforward

06:31:31.490 --> 06:31:31.500 align:start position:0%
straightforward
 
06:31:33.830 --> 06:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
while if you believe that the Supreme
 
06:31:36.110 --> 06:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
Court rulings are based on facts and
 
06:31:36.120 --> 06:31:37.190 align:start position:0%
Court rulings are based on facts and
wisdom

06:31:37.190 --> 06:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
wisdom
 
06:31:38.930 --> 06:31:38.940 align:start position:0%
well then I suggest you read Mobile
 
06:31:41.570 --> 06:31:41.580 align:start position:0%
versus Town Bridgewater because right in
 
06:31:43.548 --> 06:31:43.558 align:start position:0%
there just before Johnson after Johnson
 
06:31:47.270 --> 06:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
versus Nash was decided they did turn
 
06:31:50.090 --> 06:31:50.100 align:start position:0%
around and say up to that point it
 
06:31:52.548 --> 06:31:52.558 align:start position:0%
wasn't clear among the miss fidelities
 
06:31:55.610 --> 06:31:55.620 align:start position:0%
and at this point section c still has
 
06:31:57.948 --> 06:31:57.958 align:start position:0%
the same rewardings
 
06:32:00.048 --> 06:32:00.058 align:start position:0%
now I'd also like to say
 
06:32:02.628 --> 06:32:02.638 align:start position:0%
I've sued in the courts
 
06:32:04.490 --> 06:32:04.500 align:start position:0%
and I've asked for meetings those
 
06:32:08.030 --> 06:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
meeting minutes that was about me
 
06:32:10.670 --> 06:32:10.680 align:start position:0%
and they told the courts because the
 
06:32:12.890 --> 06:32:12.900 align:start position:0%
town told me oh well we're unprep we
 
06:32:15.230 --> 06:32:15.240 align:start position:0%
don't know if they're prepared
 
06:32:17.150 --> 06:32:17.160 align:start position:0%
now that raises the question why didn't
 
06:32:18.590 --> 06:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
they know they were prepared and I
 
06:32:20.930 --> 06:32:20.940 align:start position:0%
raised that question in the courts
 
06:32:20.940 --> 06:32:22.190 align:start position:0%
raised that question in the courts
okay

06:32:22.190 --> 06:32:22.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:32:24.830 --> 06:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
now the attorney himself
 
06:32:26.510 --> 06:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
turned around
 
06:32:29.750 --> 06:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
and he said well no we found him now
 
06:32:32.208 --> 06:32:32.218 align:start position:0%
here you go you know but we request the
 
06:32:35.448 --> 06:32:35.458 align:start position:0%
court to seal them and now I'm saying by
 
06:32:38.330 --> 06:32:38.340 align:start position:0%
doing this it's making clear that we
 
06:32:40.310 --> 06:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
have a right to attend to defend
 
06:32:42.770 --> 06:32:42.780 align:start position:0%
ourselves because you don't know how it
 
06:32:44.868 --> 06:32:44.878 align:start position:0%
feels to be in a court after reading the
 
06:32:46.490 --> 06:32:46.500 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court rulings and now being
 
06:32:48.830 --> 06:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
forced to basically defend yourself
 
06:32:51.410 --> 06:32:51.420 align:start position:0%
against a grand jury indictment that you
 
06:32:52.788 --> 06:32:52.798 align:start position:0%
can't even read
 
06:32:55.610 --> 06:32:55.620 align:start position:0%
and then you're being requested by the
 
06:32:58.788 --> 06:32:58.798 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court to turn around and take
 
06:33:01.190 --> 06:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
these courts these these meaning minutes
 
06:33:02.990 --> 06:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
that you cannot see because they're
 
06:33:04.610 --> 06:33:04.620 align:start position:0%
sealed and you're supposed to submit
 
06:33:06.708 --> 06:33:06.718 align:start position:0%
them who wants to submit a grand jury
 
06:33:09.530 --> 06:33:09.540 align:start position:0%
indictment they cannot see to a court so
 
06:33:11.510 --> 06:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
they can decide a case that you can't
 
06:33:13.670 --> 06:33:13.680 align:start position:0%
not defend yourself against because this
 
06:33:15.530 --> 06:33:15.540 align:start position:0%
is what happened and I exploded the
 
06:33:17.690 --> 06:33:17.700 align:start position:0%
docket number if you want to look it up
 
06:33:20.270 --> 06:33:20.280 align:start position:0%
because during that time
 
06:33:22.490 --> 06:33:22.500 align:start position:0%
okay I'll calm down
 
06:33:25.128 --> 06:33:25.138 align:start position:0%
during that time
 
06:33:27.890 --> 06:33:27.900 align:start position:0%
just for me to see supposedly I found
 
06:33:29.390 --> 06:33:29.400 align:start position:0%
them in their public records after I
 
06:33:31.250 --> 06:33:31.260 align:start position:0%
went to the town hall with a tape
 
06:33:33.530 --> 06:33:33.540 align:start position:0%
recorder and said well you keep telling
 
06:33:36.048 --> 06:33:36.058 align:start position:0%
me records are available for me for
 
06:33:37.850 --> 06:33:37.860 align:start position:0%
inspection well
 
06:33:40.010 --> 06:33:40.020 align:start position:0%
I want to see him and at that point they
 
06:33:41.510 --> 06:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
allowed me to see him I looked through
 
06:33:43.548 --> 06:33:43.558 align:start position:0%
them that's when I found the records and
 
06:33:45.830 --> 06:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
I asked him for it then what am I
 
06:33:46.850 --> 06:33:46.860 align:start position:0%
supposed to do with these records
 
06:33:48.230 --> 06:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to be so dangerous for
 
06:33:49.670 --> 06:33:49.680 align:start position:0%
me to see
 
06:33:51.590 --> 06:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
no no answer
 
06:33:53.990 --> 06:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not dishing the courts
 
06:33:56.810 --> 06:33:56.820 align:start position:0%
I I feel they're just trying to go along
 
06:33:58.910 --> 06:33:58.920 align:start position:0%
with the superior equivalent but this is
 
06:34:00.770 --> 06:34:00.780 align:start position:0%
the issues that you were presented here
 
06:34:03.948 --> 06:34:03.958 align:start position:0%
that you're basically standing here the
 
06:34:06.890 --> 06:34:06.900 align:start position:0%
court seems to be unclear on Whose
 
06:34:09.288 --> 06:34:09.298 align:start position:0%
reputation because when I raise the
 
06:34:12.890 --> 06:34:12.900 align:start position:0%
question of well I'm a person here that
 
06:34:14.708 --> 06:34:14.718 align:start position:0%
the meeting was about
 
06:34:18.650 --> 06:34:18.660 align:start position:0%
I ask for the meaning minutes isn't that
 
06:34:22.310 --> 06:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
equivalent to asking for this to be open
 
06:34:25.670 --> 06:34:25.680 align:start position:0%
and the only answer was no
 
06:34:27.890 --> 06:34:27.900 align:start position:0%
because we have to protect the people
 
06:34:27.900 --> 06:34:30.948 align:start position:0%
because we have to protect the people
testifying

06:34:30.948 --> 06:34:30.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:35.208 --> 06:34:35.218 align:start position:0%
okay so the person testifying accusing
 
06:34:35.218 --> 06:34:36.410 align:start position:0%
okay so the person testifying accusing
you

06:34:36.410 --> 06:34:36.420 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:34:39.830 --> 06:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
of wrongdoing has more rights
 
06:34:41.690 --> 06:34:41.700 align:start position:0%
than the person
 
06:34:43.788 --> 06:34:43.798 align:start position:0%
being accused
 
06:34:45.770 --> 06:34:45.780 align:start position:0%
and this is why I think it should be
 
06:34:48.650 --> 06:34:48.660 align:start position:0%
clarified all right and on top of that
 
06:34:52.070 --> 06:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
I'd also like to say that it also helps
 
06:34:53.750 --> 06:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
law enforcement
 
06:34:56.030 --> 06:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
I've taken a lot of time
 
06:34:58.430 --> 06:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
and basically putting myself feelings
 
06:35:00.530 --> 06:35:00.540 align:start position:0%
aside on this because if you read my
 
06:35:03.410 --> 06:35:03.420 align:start position:0%
last page on my testimony you'll know
 
06:35:04.910 --> 06:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
what I went through
 
06:35:06.650 --> 06:35:06.660 align:start position:0%
you don't know how it is to be three
 
06:35:10.730 --> 06:35:10.740 align:start position:0%
three weeks in your in your jills on
 
06:35:12.590 --> 06:35:12.600 align:start position:0%
solitary confinement
 
06:35:15.350 --> 06:35:15.360 align:start position:0%
not eating deceit drinking water and
 
06:35:16.970 --> 06:35:16.980 align:start position:0%
still have fake charges thrown against
 
06:35:16.980 --> 06:35:17.810 align:start position:0%
still have fake charges thrown against
you

06:35:17.810 --> 06:35:17.820 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:35:21.190 --> 06:35:21.200 align:start position:0%
because that's what happened to me
 
06:35:23.570 --> 06:35:23.580 align:start position:0%
I'm saying
 
06:35:25.548 --> 06:35:25.558 align:start position:0%
how much longer do you have to go sir a
 
06:35:28.128 --> 06:35:28.138 align:start position:0%
couple more minutes so I'm staying
 
06:35:28.138 --> 06:35:29.448 align:start position:0%
couple more minutes so I'm staying
basically

06:35:29.448 --> 06:35:29.458 align:start position:0%
basically
 
06:35:31.548 --> 06:35:31.558 align:start position:0%
I'm arrested
 
06:35:35.510 --> 06:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
your County attorneys never questioned
 
06:35:38.330 --> 06:35:38.340 align:start position:0%
how come no statements were taken prior
 
06:35:41.330 --> 06:35:41.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:43.548 --> 06:35:43.558 align:start position:0%
now that raises the question because now
 
06:35:47.150 --> 06:35:47.160 align:start position:0%
is this closed session being used to
 
06:35:49.190 --> 06:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
tamper with Witnesses
 
06:35:51.770 --> 06:35:51.780 align:start position:0%
and collaborate the story with the
 
06:35:51.780 --> 06:35:53.390 align:start position:0%
and collaborate the story with the
police

06:35:53.390 --> 06:35:53.400 align:start position:0%
police
 
06:35:55.190 --> 06:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
the other thing is
 
06:35:57.770 --> 06:35:57.780 align:start position:0%
the chief of police made the arrest
 
06:36:00.890 --> 06:36:00.900 align:start position:0%
well it was his wife as the chairman of
 
06:36:04.128 --> 06:36:04.138 align:start position:0%
selectment that hold held that closed
 
06:36:04.138 --> 06:36:05.030 align:start position:0%
selectment that hold held that closed
session

06:36:05.030 --> 06:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
session
 
06:36:07.970 --> 06:36:07.980 align:start position:0%
it was his cousins that were involved
 
06:36:09.890 --> 06:36:09.900 align:start position:0%
with the well drilling that I was
 
06:36:11.810 --> 06:36:11.820 align:start position:0%
insisting being monitored according to
 
06:36:11.820 --> 06:36:12.708 align:start position:0%
insisting being monitored according to
war

06:36:12.708 --> 06:36:12.718 align:start position:0%
war
 
06:36:15.590 --> 06:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
so this is a question of maybe it'll
 
06:36:19.548 --> 06:36:19.558 align:start position:0%
help the prosecutors also along with the
 
06:36:19.558 --> 06:36:20.810 align:start position:0%
help the prosecutors also along with the
courts

06:36:20.810 --> 06:36:20.820 align:start position:0%
courts
 
06:36:24.350 --> 06:36:24.360 align:start position:0%
to realize that we have a right gear
 
06:36:26.570 --> 06:36:26.580 align:start position:0%
so it's not just us it helps the courts

right to know New Hampshire views HB 654
 
06:37:22.910 --> 06:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
as an incredibly important piece of
 
06:37:25.368 --> 06:37:25.378 align:start position:0%
legislation for this year this is the
 
06:37:27.890 --> 06:37:27.900 align:start position:0%
second of two pieces of legislation that
 
06:37:30.230 --> 06:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
our members chose to focus on because it
 
06:37:31.730 --> 06:37:31.740 align:start position:0%
addresses a critical issue that is
 
06:37:33.470 --> 06:37:33.480 align:start position:0%
raised in many of the inquiries that we
 
06:37:35.930 --> 06:37:35.940 align:start position:0%
receive from the public that issue is
 
06:37:38.390 --> 06:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
the extremely broad nature and use of
 
06:37:40.368 --> 06:37:40.378 align:start position:0%
the reputation exemption as it currently
 
06:37:43.128 --> 06:37:43.138 align:start position:0%
stands this bill provides clarifying
 
06:37:44.930 --> 06:37:44.940 align:start position:0%
language that restricts the use of the
 
06:37:47.208 --> 06:37:47.218 align:start position:0%
reputation exemption only to require
 
06:37:50.150 --> 06:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
that the individual being discussed have
 
06:37:52.070 --> 06:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
the right to be notified and involved
 
06:37:53.570 --> 06:37:53.580 align:start position:0%
when their reputation is up for
 
06:37:56.030 --> 06:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
discussion and this bill has been
 
06:37:58.368 --> 06:37:58.378 align:start position:0%
modified from a previous submission to
 
06:37:59.990 --> 06:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
address major objections that were
 
06:38:03.230 --> 06:38:03.240 align:start position:0%
raised in Prior legislative years
 
06:38:05.090 --> 06:38:05.100 align:start position:0%
as people have stated before there
 
06:38:06.708 --> 06:38:06.718 align:start position:0%
currently is no requirement for those
 
06:38:08.628 --> 06:38:08.638 align:start position:0%
individuals to be involved
 
06:38:10.310 --> 06:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
but I will point out and I think this is
 
06:38:12.070 --> 06:38:12.080 align:start position:0%
an important point of clarification
 
06:38:14.690 --> 06:38:14.700 align:start position:0%
employees who have contractual rights
 
06:38:16.970 --> 06:38:16.980 align:start position:0%
are given the right to a meeting and to
 
06:38:18.650 --> 06:38:18.660 align:start position:0%
request that that meeting happen in
 
06:38:18.660 --> 06:38:19.788 align:start position:0%
request that that meeting happen in
public

06:38:19.788 --> 06:38:19.798 align:start position:0%
public
 
06:38:22.250 --> 06:38:22.260 align:start position:0%
when an exemption is claimed under the
 
06:38:24.770 --> 06:38:24.780 align:start position:0%
Personnel exemption so Mr chair in your
 
06:38:27.650 --> 06:38:27.660 align:start position:0%
example most likely a municipality that
 
06:38:29.510 --> 06:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
wants to meet regarding a Personnel
 
06:38:31.128 --> 06:38:31.138 align:start position:0%
issue like that would claim the
 
06:38:32.990 --> 06:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
Personnel exemption and if that member
 
06:38:35.750 --> 06:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
of their staff had a contract or a Union
 
06:38:37.490 --> 06:38:37.500 align:start position:0%
contract that stated that they had the
 
06:38:39.350 --> 06:38:39.360 align:start position:0%
right to a meeting that situation would
 
06:38:40.788 --> 06:38:40.798 align:start position:0%
be covered
 
06:38:42.890 --> 06:38:42.900 align:start position:0%
but there is no corresponding right for
 
06:38:44.570 --> 06:38:44.580 align:start position:0%
someone who is simply a member of the
 
06:38:46.670 --> 06:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
general public and is being discussed
 
06:38:48.830 --> 06:38:48.840 align:start position:0%
under the reputation exemption
 
06:38:50.810 --> 06:38:50.820 align:start position:0%
I think this language also provides the
 
06:38:53.270 --> 06:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
benefit of making it clear exactly what
 
06:38:56.990 --> 06:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
the objective of this exemption is and
 
06:38:59.330 --> 06:38:59.340 align:start position:0%
that is the reputation of a non-employee
 
06:39:01.548 --> 06:39:01.558 align:start position:0%
individual or organization that is the
 
06:39:03.410 --> 06:39:03.420 align:start position:0%
primary concern here and as I stated
 
06:39:05.628 --> 06:39:05.638 align:start position:0%
employees have a specific and there's
 
06:39:08.090 --> 06:39:08.100 align:start position:0%
case law supporting that exemption under
 
06:39:08.100 --> 06:39:09.770 align:start position:0%
case law supporting that exemption under
personnel

06:39:09.770 --> 06:39:09.780 align:start position:0%
personnel
 
06:39:13.128 --> 06:39:13.138 align:start position:0%
I'd like to uh preemptively address what
 
06:39:14.930 --> 06:39:14.940 align:start position:0%
I anticipate to be opposition to this
 
06:39:17.270 --> 06:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
bill the argument will probably be made
 
06:39:19.070 --> 06:39:19.080 align:start position:0%
that the requirement of notice will tie
 
06:39:20.690 --> 06:39:20.700 align:start position:0%
the hands of the public body
 
06:39:23.030 --> 06:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
I have struggled to find any examples
 
06:39:24.650 --> 06:39:24.660 align:start position:0%
where that would actually be the case
 
06:39:27.470 --> 06:39:27.480 align:start position:0%
the public body has a menu of exemptions
 
06:39:29.990 --> 06:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
to choose from exemptions A and B
 
06:39:31.850 --> 06:39:31.860 align:start position:0%
frequently referred to as Personnel
 
06:39:33.830 --> 06:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
would cover the most imminent internal
 
06:39:35.570 --> 06:39:35.580 align:start position:0%
actions that might be needed on a timely
 
06:39:38.810 --> 06:39:38.820 align:start position:0%
basis exemptions e and l provide an
 
06:39:40.788 --> 06:39:40.798 align:start position:0%
ability for the board to respond timely
 
06:39:42.890 --> 06:39:42.900 align:start position:0%
to threatened or existing lawsuit and to
 
06:39:44.448 --> 06:39:44.458 align:start position:0%
consider legal advice
 
06:39:46.788 --> 06:39:46.798 align:start position:0%
exemption D covers most purchasing
 
06:39:46.798 --> 06:39:47.930 align:start position:0%
exemption D covers most purchasing
scenarios

06:39:47.930 --> 06:39:47.940 align:start position:0%
scenarios
 
06:39:50.510 --> 06:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
exemption I covers imminent safety
 
06:39:53.810 --> 06:39:53.820 align:start position:0%
issues in what situation outside of
 
06:39:56.510 --> 06:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
those would a non-public negative
 
06:39:59.628 --> 06:39:59.638 align:start position:0%
discussion of a non-employee be
 
06:40:02.510 --> 06:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
necessary or likely when opponents of
 
06:40:04.490 --> 06:40:04.500 align:start position:0%
this bill raise that issue I challenge
 
06:40:06.650 --> 06:40:06.660 align:start position:0%
you to push back on them ask for
 
06:40:08.628 --> 06:40:08.638 align:start position:0%
concrete examples that would not fall
 
06:40:11.330 --> 06:40:11.340 align:start position:0%
under another category of exemption the
 
06:40:12.830 --> 06:40:12.840 align:start position:0%
reason there is going to be so much
 
06:40:15.470 --> 06:40:15.480 align:start position:0%
Reliance on this exemption is because it
 
06:40:18.350 --> 06:40:18.360 align:start position:0%
has served as a catch-all for so long
 
06:40:18.360 --> 06:40:20.750 align:start position:0%
has served as a catch-all for so long
[Music]

06:40:20.750 --> 06:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:40:24.110 --> 06:40:24.120 align:start position:0%
uh there's also a question of a time and
 
06:40:26.030 --> 06:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
delay in terms of giving appropriate
 
06:40:27.948 --> 06:40:27.958 align:start position:0%
notice that's been raised and I would
 
06:40:29.990 --> 06:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
note that my community sets its agenda
 
06:40:31.430 --> 06:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
for the board of selectman meeting on
 
06:40:32.868 --> 06:40:32.878 align:start position:0%
the Wednesday prior to the following
 
06:40:35.270 --> 06:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
Monday they published that on Friday and
 
06:40:37.070 --> 06:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
they identify their planned non-public
 
06:40:39.708 --> 06:40:39.718 align:start position:0%
session and the basis for it it should
 
06:40:41.990 --> 06:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
not prevent a board from going into
 
06:40:45.110 --> 06:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
during its routine operations a
 
06:40:46.850 --> 06:40:46.860 align:start position:0%
non-public session that it deems
 
06:40:48.890 --> 06:40:48.900 align:start position:0%
necessary and has planned ahead for the
 
06:40:50.628 --> 06:40:50.638 align:start position:0%
idea that non-publics happen off the
 
06:40:52.610 --> 06:40:52.620 align:start position:0%
cuff is is something that I would
 
06:40:54.288 --> 06:40:54.298 align:start position:0%
question whether or not that's actually
 
06:40:54.298 --> 06:40:56.090 align:start position:0%
question whether or not that's actually
necessary

06:40:56.090 --> 06:40:56.100 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
06:40:58.190 --> 06:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
others here have already spoken to how
 
06:40:59.330 --> 06:40:59.340 align:start position:0%
these proposed changes would help
 
06:41:00.830 --> 06:41:00.840 align:start position:0%
balance the interest of the individual
 
06:41:02.570 --> 06:41:02.580 align:start position:0%
that's involved in being discussed and
 
06:41:04.788 --> 06:41:04.798 align:start position:0%
they've provided their own examples I
 
06:41:06.048 --> 06:41:06.058 align:start position:0%
would like to testify to my personal
 
06:41:08.150 --> 06:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
experience witnessing the use of this
 
06:41:09.770 --> 06:41:09.780 align:start position:0%
exemption and discussions that I have
 
06:41:12.110 --> 06:41:12.120 align:start position:0%
been privy to about its application
 
06:41:15.650 --> 06:41:15.660 align:start position:0%
in 2022 my local Town Board of Selectmen
 
06:41:18.470 --> 06:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
held 18 non-public sessions 10 of those
 
06:41:20.510 --> 06:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
were categorized as Personnel under
 
06:41:22.970 --> 06:41:22.980 align:start position:0%
exemptions A or B eight were held under
 
06:41:24.708 --> 06:41:24.718 align:start position:0%
the heading of reputation
 
06:41:26.390 --> 06:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
while this bill does not change the
 
06:41:28.128 --> 06:41:28.138 align:start position:0%
reputation exemption that is allowed for
 
06:41:29.990 --> 06:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
sealing the minutes that is a separate
 
06:41:31.730 --> 06:41:31.740 align:start position:0%
set of exemptions and I'm not sure that
 
06:41:34.070 --> 06:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
all of you are aware of that I will
 
06:41:36.048 --> 06:41:36.058 align:start position:0%
tangentially note that every single set
 
06:41:37.850 --> 06:41:37.860 align:start position:0%
of sealed minutes related to Personnel
 
06:41:39.708 --> 06:41:39.718 align:start position:0%
were sealed on the basis of reputation
 
06:41:41.150 --> 06:41:41.160 align:start position:0%
as a concern
 
06:41:42.890 --> 06:41:42.900 align:start position:0%
preventing the public from seeing what
 
06:41:44.810 --> 06:41:44.820 align:start position:0%
was discussed it's not clear to me
 
06:41:46.430 --> 06:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
whether those Personnel members had the
 
06:41:48.288 --> 06:41:48.298 align:start position:0%
right to be present or were notified as
 
06:41:50.090 --> 06:41:50.100 align:start position:0%
a court in accordance with exemption a
 
06:41:52.190 --> 06:41:52.200 align:start position:0%
that information is simply not captured
 
06:41:53.628 --> 06:41:53.638 align:start position:0%
in public minutes
 
06:41:55.490 --> 06:41:55.500 align:start position:0%
but when it comes to those sessions that
 
06:41:56.628 --> 06:41:56.638 align:start position:0%
were held under the heading of
 
06:41:58.970 --> 06:41:58.980 align:start position:0%
reputation which is what this bill talks
 
06:42:01.070 --> 06:42:01.080 align:start position:0%
about I have two concerns that I want to
 
06:42:01.080 --> 06:42:01.970 align:start position:0%
about I have two concerns that I want to
share

06:42:01.970 --> 06:42:01.980 align:start position:0%
share
 
06:42:04.190 --> 06:42:04.200 align:start position:0%
the first is that public bodies are very
 
06:42:06.048 --> 06:42:06.058 align:start position:0%
aware of the broad nature of the
 
06:42:08.270 --> 06:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
reputation exemption I don't like to use
 
06:42:10.548 --> 06:42:10.558 align:start position:0%
examples I can't personally attest to
 
06:42:12.288 --> 06:42:12.298 align:start position:0%
but I'm a member of the public and I
 
06:42:13.610 --> 06:42:13.620 align:start position:0%
have to rely on those who have sat
 
06:42:15.288 --> 06:42:15.298 align:start position:0%
through non-public sessions and the
 
06:42:17.330 --> 06:42:17.340 align:start position:0%
information they've shared with me one
 
06:42:19.190 --> 06:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
of the most egregious and concerning
 
06:42:21.288 --> 06:42:21.298 align:start position:0%
examples I have ever heard from someone
 
06:42:23.270 --> 06:42:23.280 align:start position:0%

body

06:42:29.570 --> 06:42:29.580 align:start position:0%
body
 
06:42:32.030 --> 06:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
in conversation with me a member of a
 
06:42:34.250 --> 06:42:34.260 align:start position:0%
public body without disclosing the
 
06:42:36.530 --> 06:42:36.540 align:start position:0%
content of the non-public session shared
 
06:42:38.510 --> 06:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
with me that their public body was not
 
06:42:40.430 --> 06:42:40.440 align:start position:0%
sure whether the discussion they were
 
06:42:42.288 --> 06:42:42.298 align:start position:0%
engaged in would truly Merit exemption
 
06:42:44.448 --> 06:42:44.458 align:start position:0%
under the reputation exemption
 
06:42:46.910 --> 06:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
to ensure that that exemption would
 
06:42:49.310 --> 06:42:49.320 align:start position:0%
apply one member of the public body
 
06:42:51.470 --> 06:42:51.480 align:start position:0%
specifically stated that they found it
 
06:42:54.350 --> 06:42:54.360 align:start position:0%
necessary to say something bad about an
 
06:42:56.810 --> 06:42:56.820 align:start position:0%
individual or organization so that the
 
06:42:58.610 --> 06:42:58.620 align:start position:0%
exemption could credibly be used to
 
06:43:00.288 --> 06:43:00.298 align:start position:0%
maintain the confidentiality of that
 
06:43:03.110 --> 06:43:03.120 align:start position:0%
session and so they did and Justified
 
06:43:05.270 --> 06:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
the exemption
 
06:43:07.430 --> 06:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
another example of the broad nature of
 
06:43:08.628 --> 06:43:08.638 align:start position:0%
this exemption is one that happened
 
06:43:11.150 --> 06:43:11.160 align:start position:0%
fairly recently in my hometown on
 
06:43:14.030 --> 06:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
December 27 2022 my local Board of
 
06:43:15.708 --> 06:43:15.718 align:start position:0%
Selectmen went into non-public session
 
06:43:17.930 --> 06:43:17.940 align:start position:0%
under the reputation exemption to
 
06:43:19.850 --> 06:43:19.860 align:start position:0%
protect the identity of potential donors
 
06:43:22.190 --> 06:43:22.200 align:start position:0%
to the town they claimed that because
 
06:43:23.810 --> 06:43:23.820 align:start position:0%
the donors would not make the donation
 
06:43:25.970 --> 06:43:25.980 align:start position:0%
without anonymity they needed to discuss
 
06:43:28.010 --> 06:43:28.020 align:start position:0%
those in non-public session
 
06:43:29.810 --> 06:43:29.820 align:start position:0%
anonymity and potential conflict of
 
06:43:31.190 --> 06:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
interest are separate but related
 
06:43:33.590 --> 06:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
concerns I have with this approach but I
 
06:43:35.750 --> 06:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
find the idea that making a donation to
 
06:43:37.490 --> 06:43:37.500 align:start position:0%
The Community could be construed as
 
06:43:39.470 --> 06:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
potentially having an adverse effect on
 
06:43:41.090 --> 06:43:41.100 align:start position:0%
someone's reputation absolutely
 
06:43:41.100 --> 06:43:42.230 align:start position:0%
someone's reputation absolutely
laughable

06:43:42.230 --> 06:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
laughable
 
06:43:43.730 --> 06:43:43.740 align:start position:0%
the board could have discussed the
 
06:43:45.770 --> 06:43:45.780 align:start position:0%
donation without identifying the donors
 
06:43:47.990 --> 06:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
while in public session but the board
 
06:43:49.548 --> 06:43:49.558 align:start position:0%
proceeded to go into non-public
 
06:43:52.010 --> 06:43:52.020 align:start position:0%
according to the chairman on the advice
 
06:43:54.410 --> 06:43:54.420 align:start position:0%
of legal counsel I believe that is
 
06:43:56.330 --> 06:43:56.340 align:start position:0%
because legal counsel recognizes this
 
06:43:57.948 --> 06:43:57.958 align:start position:0%
exemption as broad enough to cover
 
06:43:59.868 --> 06:43:59.878 align:start position:0%
pretty much everything they think it can
 
06:43:59.878 --> 06:44:01.250 align:start position:0%
pretty much everything they think it can
justify

06:44:01.250 --> 06:44:01.260 align:start position:0%
justify
 
06:44:03.590 --> 06:44:03.600 align:start position:0%
I cite these examples to point out how
 
06:44:05.570 --> 06:44:05.580 align:start position:0%
easy it is to manipulate this exemption
 
06:44:07.128 --> 06:44:07.138 align:start position:0%
while keeping the public and those
 
06:44:08.868 --> 06:44:08.878 align:start position:0%
involved in the dark regarding the
 
06:44:11.150 --> 06:44:11.160 align:start position:0%
discussion I believe that by requiring
 
06:44:13.430 --> 06:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
public bodies through this bill to put
 
06:44:15.350 --> 06:44:15.360 align:start position:0%
some forethought and some accountability
 
06:44:17.448 --> 06:44:17.458 align:start position:0%
into the invocation of this exemption
 
06:44:19.430 --> 06:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
they will become more conscientious
 
06:44:21.288 --> 06:44:21.298 align:start position:0%
about its use
 
06:44:23.390 --> 06:44:23.400 align:start position:0%
there is a second indirect way that I
 
06:44:24.590 --> 06:44:24.600 align:start position:0%
think these changes would benefit
 
06:44:26.390 --> 06:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
members of the public and it is not
 
06:44:28.190 --> 06:44:28.200 align:start position:0%
admittedly the primary intent of this
 
06:44:28.200 --> 06:44:29.090 align:start position:0%
admittedly the primary intent of this
bill

06:44:29.090 --> 06:44:29.100 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:44:31.070 --> 06:44:31.080 align:start position:0%
these changes could impact how public
 
06:44:33.048 --> 06:44:33.058 align:start position:0%
discussions that impact one's reputation
 
06:44:35.690 --> 06:44:35.700 align:start position:0%
are managed there is no right of an
 
06:44:36.910 --> 06:44:36.920 align:start position:0%
individual to protect their own
 
06:44:39.470 --> 06:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
reputation or even be free to respond
 
06:44:41.930 --> 06:44:41.940 align:start position:0%
when it is up for public discussion and
 
06:44:43.910 --> 06:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
this bill does not address public
 
06:44:46.128 --> 06:44:46.138 align:start position:0%
discussion directly most of the time for
 
06:44:48.110 --> 06:44:48.120 align:start position:0%
the sake of transparency right to know
 
06:44:49.548 --> 06:44:49.558 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire would prefer those
 
06:44:51.770 --> 06:44:51.780 align:start position:0%
conversations happen in the open in
 
06:44:54.590 --> 06:44:54.600 align:start position:0%
public but if this bill is enacted it is
 
06:44:56.090 --> 06:44:56.100 align:start position:0%
also more likely that when the
 
06:44:57.830 --> 06:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
discussion begins to drift into
 
06:45:00.288 --> 06:45:00.298 align:start position:0%
questionable territory in real time
 
06:45:03.890 --> 06:45:03.900 align:start position:0%
with this um language in place
 
06:45:06.230 --> 06:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
it may be possible to reconsider that
 
06:45:08.750 --> 06:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
conversation for non-public session with
 
06:45:10.368 --> 06:45:10.378 align:start position:0%
the inclusion of the individual in
 
06:45:12.770 --> 06:45:12.780 align:start position:0%
question being given appropriate notice
 
06:45:15.170 --> 06:45:15.180 align:start position:0%
without requiring an individual to be
 
06:45:17.448 --> 06:45:17.458 align:start position:0%
notified and able to participate a
 
06:45:19.430 --> 06:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
decision to move into non-public simply
 
06:45:21.170 --> 06:45:21.180 align:start position:0%
hides the content of that discussion
 
06:45:23.390 --> 06:45:23.400 align:start position:0%
from the individual Who's involved that
 
06:45:25.190 --> 06:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
lack of knowledge does not protect them
 
06:45:27.590 --> 06:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
it merely Shields those who are making
 
06:45:29.448 --> 06:45:29.458 align:start position:0%
those comments and that is another
 
06:45:31.070 --> 06:45:31.080 align:start position:0%
reason I think this change in language
 
06:45:32.990 --> 06:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
is so important
 
06:45:35.090 --> 06:45:35.100 align:start position:0%
during questions and answers if you want
 
06:45:36.830 --> 06:45:36.840 align:start position:0%
I can provide a couple of very Vivid
 
06:45:38.448 --> 06:45:38.458 align:start position:0%
examples where such an approach to a
 
06:45:40.368 --> 06:45:40.378 align:start position:0%
public discussion was very much desired
 
06:45:42.590 --> 06:45:42.600 align:start position:0%
by the individuals who are in question
 
06:45:45.288 --> 06:45:45.298 align:start position:0%
but since the opportunity to participate
 
06:45:47.390 --> 06:45:47.400 align:start position:0%
in closed session did not exist at the
 
06:45:49.490 --> 06:45:49.500 align:start position:0%
time and it would under this bill they
 
06:45:51.048 --> 06:45:51.058 align:start position:0%
had no choice but to listen to very
 
06:45:53.810 --> 06:45:53.820 align:start position:0%
public accusations and claims
 
06:45:55.368 --> 06:45:55.378 align:start position:0%
it is not the primary intent of this
 
06:45:56.990 --> 06:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
bill but I do think it would encourage a
 
06:45:58.610 --> 06:45:58.620 align:start position:0%
more thoughtful approach again and
 
06:46:00.350 --> 06:46:00.360 align:start position:0%
provide a more Equitable alternative
 
06:46:02.448 --> 06:46:02.458 align:start position:0%
rather than closing the doors and not
 
06:46:03.830 --> 06:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
allowing the individual involved to
 
06:46:05.690 --> 06:46:05.700 align:start position:0%
respond when public discussions begin to
 
06:46:07.490 --> 06:46:07.500 align:start position:0%
move dangerously close to slandering
 
06:46:08.990 --> 06:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
members of the public
 
06:46:10.610 --> 06:46:10.620 align:start position:0%
right to know New Hampshire strongly
 
06:46:13.250 --> 06:46:13.260 align:start position:0%
supports HB 652 in hopes that this body
 
06:46:15.110 --> 06:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
will vote in as ought to pass and I'm
 
06:46:16.610 --> 06:46:16.620 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions at this
 
06:46:20.690 --> 06:46:20.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:24.590 --> 06:46:24.600 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you uh uh
 
06:46:28.030 --> 06:46:28.040 align:start position:0%
that's great H
 
06:46:31.430 --> 06:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr thank you Mr chair Nate
 
06:46:33.410 --> 06:46:33.420 align:start position:0%
Grace for the municipal Association we
 
06:46:36.170 --> 06:46:36.180 align:start position:0%
do oppose this bill uh I will be brief
 
06:46:37.910 --> 06:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
because the chair already outlined a
 
06:46:40.070 --> 06:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
number of concerns that we had
 
06:46:41.750 --> 06:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
I don't want to be repetitious
 
06:46:43.250 --> 06:46:43.260 align:start position:0%
especially after you've had such a long
 
06:46:43.260 --> 06:46:44.810 align:start position:0%
especially after you've had such a long
day

06:46:44.810 --> 06:46:44.820 align:start position:0%
day
 
06:46:47.990 --> 06:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
um I do want to note a couple other uh
 
06:46:48.000 --> 06:46:49.310 align:start position:0%
um I do want to note a couple other uh
things

06:46:49.310 --> 06:46:49.320 align:start position:0%
things
 
06:46:52.070 --> 06:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
um as representative greeson pointed out
 
06:46:54.350 --> 06:46:54.360 align:start position:0%
um there's no process spelled out for
 
06:46:56.590 --> 06:46:56.600 align:start position:0%
how that written notifications to occur
 
06:47:00.230 --> 06:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
as this committee is is aware you've
 
06:47:02.930 --> 06:47:02.940 align:start position:0%
recommended House Bill 307 as octopass
 
06:47:07.070 --> 06:47:07.080 align:start position:0%
which uh if a municipality were to pick
 
06:47:09.170 --> 06:47:09.180 align:start position:0%
the wrong option we'd be we'd be paying
 
06:47:11.330 --> 06:47:11.340 align:start position:0%
for the legal cost to get that resolved
 
06:47:13.670 --> 06:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
so I prefer not to do that and I would
 
06:47:16.670 --> 06:47:16.680 align:start position:0%
like some clarification if possible
 
06:47:19.610 --> 06:47:19.620 align:start position:0%
um it also appears to me that the uh
 
06:47:22.788 --> 06:47:22.798 align:start position:0%
numbers one two and three
 
06:47:24.830 --> 06:47:24.840 align:start position:0%
um where the person has the opportunity
 
06:47:26.990 --> 06:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
to be present have counsel and speak on
 
06:47:29.208 --> 06:47:29.218 align:start position:0%
their own behalf is really seems to be
 
06:47:31.190 --> 06:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
targeted towards a hearing type
 
06:47:34.310 --> 06:47:34.320 align:start position:0%
situation not a public meeting
 
06:47:37.128 --> 06:47:37.138 align:start position:0%
um and we're not talking about a hearing
 
06:47:39.170 --> 06:47:39.180 align:start position:0%
under this section we're talking about
 
06:47:41.930 --> 06:47:41.940 align:start position:0%
public meetings
 
06:47:44.448 --> 06:47:44.458 align:start position:0%
um probably the best example I can give
 
06:47:48.530 --> 06:47:48.540 align:start position:0%
you of a municipal situation where
 
06:47:48.540 --> 06:47:49.730 align:start position:0%
you of a municipal situation where
um

06:47:49.730 --> 06:47:49.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:47:51.468 --> 06:47:51.478 align:start position:0%
where the body will enter into
 
06:47:54.288 --> 06:47:54.298 align:start position:0%
non-public session is in the case of
 
06:47:57.350 --> 06:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
where they are doing an abatement for
 
06:47:59.868 --> 06:47:59.878 align:start position:0%
someone who is poor or unable to pay
 
06:48:01.670 --> 06:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
their taxes
 
06:48:03.410 --> 06:48:03.420 align:start position:0%
um if that person is on Municipal
 
06:48:07.010 --> 06:48:07.020 align:start position:0%
welfare under uh RSA uh pursuant to RSA
 
06:48:10.670 --> 06:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
chapter 165. the municipality can't
 
06:48:13.850 --> 06:48:13.860 align:start position:0%
release information about that person uh
 
06:48:15.770 --> 06:48:15.780 align:start position:0%
being on welfare there they have that
 
06:48:18.048 --> 06:48:18.058 align:start position:0%
privacy protection
 
06:48:20.208 --> 06:48:20.218 align:start position:0%
um and so presumably they're going to
 
06:48:22.430 --> 06:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
apply for an abatement if they're in
 
06:48:24.590 --> 06:48:24.600 align:start position:0%
their own home they can't pay for the
 
06:48:27.708 --> 06:48:27.718 align:start position:0%
taxes and in that case the municipal is
 
06:48:28.610 --> 06:48:28.620 align:start position:0%
gonna have to figure out how to
 
06:48:30.590 --> 06:48:30.600 align:start position:0%
structure these type of meetings in a
 
06:48:34.010 --> 06:48:34.020 align:start position:0%
way that would allow them to
 
06:48:36.468 --> 06:48:36.478 align:start position:0%
have people come in and be represented
 
06:48:38.750 --> 06:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
if they want to we'll also not
 
06:48:40.368 --> 06:48:40.378 align:start position:0%
disclosing that they're receiving that
 
06:48:42.530 --> 06:48:42.540 align:start position:0%
type of assistance so that could be
 
06:48:44.570 --> 06:48:44.580 align:start position:0%
problematic that's one thing I hadn't
 
06:48:46.368 --> 06:48:46.378 align:start position:0%
heard concerns of from the committee and
 
06:48:47.390 --> 06:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to bring that to your
 
06:48:49.250 --> 06:48:49.260 align:start position:0%
attention there's certainly many other
 
06:48:51.288 --> 06:48:51.298 align:start position:0%
scenarios where
 
06:48:53.890 --> 06:48:53.900 align:start position:0%
um some sort of uh some sort of
 
06:48:57.110 --> 06:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
Investigation or other or other uh other
 
06:48:59.570 --> 06:48:59.580 align:start position:0%
thing could be going on there
 
06:48:59.580 --> 06:49:00.590 align:start position:0%
thing could be going on there
um

06:49:00.590 --> 06:49:00.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:49:02.628 --> 06:49:02.638 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to take any questions that
 
06:49:03.830 --> 06:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
you may have
 
06:49:07.310 --> 06:49:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:09.350 --> 06:49:09.360 align:start position:0%
yes representative Perez
 
06:49:10.968 --> 06:49:10.978 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:49:12.830 --> 06:49:12.840 align:start position:0%
the term that was used small town
 
06:49:15.410 --> 06:49:15.420 align:start position:0%
politics is very true I've witnessed it
 
06:49:18.830 --> 06:49:18.840 align:start position:0%
for the past 40 years here in New
 
06:49:22.190 --> 06:49:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:24.170 --> 06:49:24.180 align:start position:0%
more prevalent
 
06:49:24.180 --> 06:49:24.890 align:start position:0%
more prevalent
um

06:49:24.890 --> 06:49:24.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:49:27.230 --> 06:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
I see it in the town I live in I see it
 
06:49:29.628 --> 06:49:29.638 align:start position:0%
in many towns where
 
06:49:32.708 --> 06:49:32.718 align:start position:0%
um executive the use of executive
 
06:49:36.890 --> 06:49:36.900 align:start position:0%
session to talk about people is
 
06:49:40.670 --> 06:49:40.680 align:start position:0%
there's no reeling that in I believe is
 
06:49:43.010 --> 06:49:43.020 align:start position:0%
it the sixth amendment that gives me the
 
06:49:45.590 --> 06:49:45.600 align:start position:0%
right to know my Accuser
 
06:49:49.030 --> 06:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
maybe that applies for
 
06:49:51.948 --> 06:49:51.958 align:start position:0%
law cases but
 
06:49:55.448 --> 06:49:55.458 align:start position:0%
I think that small towns small boards
 
06:49:58.310 --> 06:49:58.320 align:start position:0%
Selectmen or we have Town Council where
 
06:49:59.150 --> 06:49:59.160 align:start position:0%
I live
 
06:50:02.330 --> 06:50:02.340 align:start position:0%
are using this executive session to
 
06:50:06.170 --> 06:50:06.180 align:start position:0%
discuss people discuss things that
 
06:50:08.868 --> 06:50:08.878 align:start position:0%
you have no right to defend yourself or
 
06:50:10.128 --> 06:50:10.138 align:start position:0%
even hear
 
06:50:14.570 --> 06:50:14.580 align:start position:0%
if what's being said is true it's a here
 
06:50:16.670 --> 06:50:16.680 align:start position:0%
he said she said
 
06:50:19.368 --> 06:50:19.378 align:start position:0%
and I'm not there to say that that's not
 
06:50:22.190 --> 06:50:22.200 align:start position:0%
what happened and I don't mean that
 
06:50:25.548 --> 06:50:25.558 align:start position:0%
personally but I think we do need some
 
06:50:29.530 --> 06:50:29.540 align:start position:0%
reeling in of a small town or
 
06:50:33.650 --> 06:50:33.660 align:start position:0%
municipalities so that they people who
 
06:50:36.610 --> 06:50:36.620 align:start position:0%
are we need to stand up for the people
 
06:50:36.620 --> 06:50:38.170 align:start position:0%
are we need to stand up for the people
and

06:50:38.170 --> 06:50:38.180 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:50:40.910 --> 06:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
make sure that even though these boards
 
06:50:43.850 --> 06:50:43.860 align:start position:0%
are elected that it doesn't give them
 
06:50:47.930 --> 06:50:47.940 align:start position:0%
the power to take away my rights as an
 
06:50:50.510 --> 06:50:50.520 align:start position:0%
individual to defend myself or defend
 
06:50:53.510 --> 06:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
against being falsely accused I think
 
06:50:56.468 --> 06:50:56.478 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
06:51:00.350 --> 06:51:00.360 align:start position:0%
will make small town or every
 
06:51:04.670 --> 06:51:04.680 align:start position:0%
municipality think twice before they say
 
06:51:06.048 --> 06:51:06.058 align:start position:0%
you know you know what I heard about
 
06:51:11.690 --> 06:51:11.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:15.230 --> 06:51:15.240 align:start position:0%
oh my question is is not my right to to
 
06:51:18.830 --> 06:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
um uh know my accuser and know what's
 
06:51:20.868 --> 06:51:20.878 align:start position:0%
beyond being accused of
 
06:51:22.788 --> 06:51:22.798 align:start position:0%
so the U.S Supreme Court has been very
 
06:51:26.090 --> 06:51:26.100 align:start position:0%
clear that's in the context of a a
 
06:51:28.610 --> 06:51:28.620 align:start position:0%
Judicial hearing so
 
06:51:30.288 --> 06:51:30.298 align:start position:0%
if you're
 
06:51:32.208 --> 06:51:32.218 align:start position:0%
the government's starting some sort of
 
06:51:35.090 --> 06:51:35.100 align:start position:0%
Investigation because some
 
06:51:37.070 --> 06:51:37.080 align:start position:0%
information has come to your attention
 
06:51:40.910 --> 06:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't come into play there
 
06:51:43.310 --> 06:51:43.320 align:start position:0%
um I don't have a court case to cite you
 
06:51:45.048 --> 06:51:45.058 align:start position:0%
right now although I do want to mention
 
06:51:47.750 --> 06:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
on another context I forgot to mention I
 
06:51:51.288 --> 06:51:51.298 align:start position:0%
gave your researcher a copy of the one
 
06:51:52.788 --> 06:51:52.798 align:start position:0%
court case I could find in New Hampshire
 
06:51:54.230 --> 06:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Supreme Court about
 
06:51:56.448 --> 06:51:56.458 align:start position:0%
the reputation exemption because having
 
06:51:58.070 --> 06:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
heard from this committee previously I
 
06:51:59.750 --> 06:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
know you like to look at any New
 
06:52:01.368 --> 06:52:01.378 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court case decisions
 
06:52:03.830 --> 06:52:03.840 align:start position:0%
and I think that's helpful to illustrate
 
06:52:07.548 --> 06:52:07.558 align:start position:0%
how that functions currently under our
 
06:52:09.948 --> 06:52:09.958 align:start position:0%
existing law and so she has that for the
 
06:52:12.410 --> 06:52:12.420 align:start position:0%
committee we do have we do have it thank
 
06:52:12.420 --> 06:52:13.968 align:start position:0%
committee we do have we do have it thank
you

06:52:13.968 --> 06:52:13.978 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:52:17.868 --> 06:52:17.878 align:start position:0%
yes representative yes sorry I I have
 
06:52:19.490 --> 06:52:19.500 align:start position:0%
some confusion and I don't know if
 
06:52:20.750 --> 06:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
you're the right person but I'm going to
 
06:52:21.650 --> 06:52:21.660 align:start position:0%
ask you
 
06:52:25.190 --> 06:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
um I'm hearing that this can both
 
06:52:29.090 --> 06:52:29.100 align:start position:0%
protect someone's reputation
 
06:52:30.830 --> 06:52:30.840 align:start position:0%
um but it's also a non-public session
 
06:52:33.128 --> 06:52:33.138 align:start position:0%
where someone's reputation could be
 
06:52:35.448 --> 06:52:35.458 align:start position:0%
discussed in private
 
06:52:37.250 --> 06:52:37.260 align:start position:0%
and I guess I'm having trouble
 
06:52:40.250 --> 06:52:40.260 align:start position:0%
reconciling that in my head
 
06:52:42.770 --> 06:52:42.780 align:start position:0%
um in terms of a non-public session this
 
06:52:44.628 --> 06:52:44.638 align:start position:0%
is a deliberation between the public
 
06:52:48.830 --> 06:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
body that is being kept in in private
 
06:52:51.288 --> 06:52:51.298 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of protecting someone's
 
06:52:54.770 --> 06:52:54.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:56.628 --> 06:52:56.638 align:start position:0%
doesn't does this work in the opposite
 
06:52:58.490 --> 06:52:58.500 align:start position:0%
direction as well like if somebody had
 
06:53:01.070 --> 06:53:01.080 align:start position:0%
made an accusation to to save my the
 
06:53:03.170 --> 06:53:03.180 align:start position:0%
board in my town select board in my town
 
06:53:05.690 --> 06:53:05.700 align:start position:0%
you know and they wanted to discuss it
 
06:53:07.368 --> 06:53:07.378 align:start position:0%
in private and decide whether to take
 
06:53:10.190 --> 06:53:10.200 align:start position:0%
any action or not and they perhaps
 
06:53:13.310 --> 06:53:13.320 align:start position:0%
decide not to take any action and the
 
06:53:15.830 --> 06:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
meeting is is done and nobody was ever
 
06:53:17.750 --> 06:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
notified that that it was brought up
 
06:53:20.150 --> 06:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
because they decided it wasn't is that a
 
06:53:22.010 --> 06:53:22.020 align:start position:0%
valid scenario is that part of what
 
06:53:23.750 --> 06:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
going into non-public session would
 
06:53:27.048 --> 06:53:27.058 align:start position:0%
would do that this sort of Might then
 
06:53:29.270 --> 06:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
almost interfere with
 
06:53:32.090 --> 06:53:32.100 align:start position:0%
yes I think that's very valid
 
06:53:32.100 --> 06:53:33.170 align:start position:0%
yes I think that's very valid
um

06:53:33.170 --> 06:53:33.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:53:35.208 --> 06:53:35.218 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's obviously the case
 
06:53:35.218 --> 06:53:36.468 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's obviously the case
that

06:53:36.468 --> 06:53:36.478 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:53:38.208 --> 06:53:38.218 align:start position:0%
if someone doesn't like you as I
 
06:53:40.190 --> 06:53:40.200 align:start position:0%
experience quite frequently
 
06:53:42.048 --> 06:53:42.058 align:start position:0%
um they may talk about you in public or
 
06:53:43.670 --> 06:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
they may talk about you in in private
 
06:53:45.110 --> 06:53:45.120 align:start position:0%
and there are certainly
 
06:53:48.590 --> 06:53:48.600 align:start position:0%
different factual contexts where Maybe
 
06:53:52.910 --> 06:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
more impactful on how the legislature
 
06:53:55.250 --> 06:53:55.260 align:start position:0%
sees me for example
 
06:53:58.070 --> 06:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
um and whether that's done in private or
 
06:54:00.708 --> 06:54:00.718 align:start position:0%
public it may be the case that
 
06:54:02.150 --> 06:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
um there's a discussion that occurs in
 
06:54:05.090 --> 06:54:05.100 align:start position:0%
private that resolves successfully and
 
06:54:06.590 --> 06:54:06.600 align:start position:0%
nothing is to be made public and that's
 
06:54:08.628 --> 06:54:08.638 align:start position:0%
for the best for everyone it may be the
 
06:54:10.250 --> 06:54:10.260 align:start position:0%
case that that's not the it's not the
 
06:54:13.010 --> 06:54:13.020 align:start position:0%
case but it's currently uh the local
 
06:54:14.868 --> 06:54:14.878 align:start position:0%
decision and
 
06:54:17.930 --> 06:54:17.940 align:start position:0%
uh I believe everyone
 
06:54:20.990 --> 06:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
hopefully striving towards making the
 
06:54:22.250 --> 06:54:22.260 align:start position:0%
best decision with the information they
 
06:54:23.868 --> 06:54:23.878 align:start position:0%
have on hand as to whether to make that
 
06:54:25.490 --> 06:54:25.500 align:start position:0%
public or not
 
06:54:29.628 --> 06:54:29.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:32.030 --> 06:54:32.040 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you oh I'm sorry
 
06:54:34.070 --> 06:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
representative trip sorry
 
06:54:34.080 --> 06:54:35.750 align:start position:0%
representative trip sorry
uh

06:54:35.750 --> 06:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:54:37.430 --> 06:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna follow up on something uh
 
06:54:40.730 --> 06:54:40.740 align:start position:0%
representative said uh it seems to me
 
06:54:43.850 --> 06:54:43.860 align:start position:0%
that uh discussion of uh
 
06:54:48.230 --> 06:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
uh someone in a non-public session is
 
06:54:52.788 --> 06:54:52.798 align:start position:0%
more akin to uh you know evaluating a
 
06:54:54.770 --> 06:54:54.780 align:start position:0%
discussion an investigation or something
 
06:54:57.288 --> 06:54:57.298 align:start position:0%
would you agree with that
 
06:55:01.128 --> 06:55:01.138 align:start position:0%
I would I think that and that uh should
 
06:55:03.770 --> 06:55:03.780 align:start position:0%
they be charged with something
 
06:55:05.868 --> 06:55:05.878 align:start position:0%
should should the the discussion lead to
 
06:55:07.730 --> 06:55:07.740 align:start position:0%
a charge that would be public is that
 
06:55:09.948 --> 06:55:09.958 align:start position:0%
correct correct
 
06:55:12.230 --> 06:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
so obviously that would go through the
 
06:55:14.570 --> 06:55:14.580 align:start position:0%
regular court process which is of course
 
06:55:14.580 --> 06:55:16.070 align:start position:0%
regular court process which is of course
public

06:55:16.070 --> 06:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
public
 
06:55:19.250 --> 06:55:19.260 align:start position:0%
so so it's it seems like uh it is
 
06:55:22.368 --> 06:55:22.378 align:start position:0%
representative tour said uh if you if
 
06:55:24.010 --> 06:55:24.020 align:start position:0%
you're in between
 
06:55:27.770 --> 06:55:27.780 align:start position:0%
the investigation and the decision uh
 
06:55:27.780 --> 06:55:29.810 align:start position:0%
the investigation and the decision uh
it's

06:55:29.810 --> 06:55:29.820 align:start position:0%
it's
 
06:55:31.788 --> 06:55:31.798 align:start position:0%
it's worthwhile to make sure it's done
 
06:55:34.250 --> 06:55:34.260 align:start position:0%
in non-public so that should you decide
 
06:55:36.890 --> 06:55:36.900 align:start position:0%
not to make an accusation that remains
 
06:55:39.770 --> 06:55:39.780 align:start position:0%
private is that correct yes all right
 
06:55:43.968 --> 06:55:43.978 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:47.208 --> 06:55:47.218 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm um what do you say one of
 
06:55:49.730 --> 06:55:49.740 align:start position:0%
the things that that um was raised in I
 
06:55:51.288 --> 06:55:51.298 align:start position:0%
think in previous in response to my
 
06:55:53.810 --> 06:55:53.820 align:start position:0%
earlier question was that well in the
 
06:55:56.930 --> 06:55:56.940 align:start position:0%
example that I gave the ability to have
 
06:55:58.510 --> 06:55:58.520 align:start position:0%
the matter
 
06:56:02.690 --> 06:56:02.700 align:start position:0%
conducted uh non-publicly without the
 
06:56:04.430 --> 06:56:04.440 align:start position:0%
person whose reputation might be
 
06:56:07.430 --> 06:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
adversely affected uh having to fall
 
06:56:09.830 --> 06:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
within this proposed section would be
 
06:56:11.448 --> 06:56:11.458 align:start position:0%
the personnel
 
06:56:13.788 --> 06:56:13.798 align:start position:0%
the exemption for personnel matters or
 
06:56:16.730 --> 06:56:16.740 align:start position:0%
something like that and so what do you
 
06:56:19.368 --> 06:56:19.378 align:start position:0%
say about that you know that this so
 
06:56:19.378 --> 06:56:20.930 align:start position:0%
say about that you know that this so
under

06:56:20.930 --> 06:56:20.940 align:start position:0%
under
 
06:56:26.208 --> 06:56:26.218 align:start position:0%
um RSA 91a3 Roman 2 a if you're an
 
06:56:28.670 --> 06:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
employee there's already a provision for
 
06:56:32.150 --> 06:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
allowing investigation and that
 
06:56:34.070 --> 06:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
sort of kick off could start a
 
06:56:36.048 --> 06:56:36.058 align:start position:0%
non-public session
 
06:56:36.058 --> 06:56:36.650 align:start position:0%
non-public session
um

06:56:36.650 --> 06:56:36.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:56:39.830 --> 06:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
so I guess to to you to borrow an
 
06:56:42.170 --> 06:56:42.180 align:start position:0%
example that was brought up earlier
 
06:56:45.288 --> 06:56:45.298 align:start position:0%
it may be the case that if a library
 
06:56:47.690 --> 06:56:47.700 align:start position:0%
director decides to do something without
 
06:56:50.510 --> 06:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
the advice and consent of the trustees
 
06:56:50.520 --> 06:56:52.250 align:start position:0%
the advice and consent of the trustees
these

06:56:52.250 --> 06:56:52.260 align:start position:0%
these
 
06:56:53.990 --> 06:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
that Library director might be
 
06:56:57.530 --> 06:56:57.540 align:start position:0%
investigated and witnesses to whatever
 
06:56:59.690 --> 06:56:59.700 align:start position:0%
is occurring might be interviewed as
 
06:57:02.090 --> 06:57:02.100 align:start position:0%
part of that investigation the witness's
 
06:57:04.670 --> 06:57:04.680 align:start position:0%
reputation wouldn't be at stake but they
 
06:57:06.530 --> 06:57:06.540 align:start position:0%
wouldn't necessarily be informed of the
 
06:57:08.868 --> 06:57:08.878 align:start position:0%
investigation because they just know
 
06:57:10.968 --> 06:57:10.978 align:start position:0%
whatever part of the event and then the
 
06:57:12.708 --> 06:57:12.718 align:start position:0%
investigators job is to put it all
 
06:57:15.350 --> 06:57:15.360 align:start position:0%
together if it's the case that it's
 
06:57:17.990 --> 06:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
you know a library trustee being accused
 
06:57:21.288 --> 06:57:21.298 align:start position:0%
of stealing money for example
 
06:57:24.590 --> 06:57:24.600 align:start position:0%
um then that person is not an employee
 
06:57:26.628 --> 06:57:26.638 align:start position:0%
of the Town therefore they wouldn't fall
 
06:57:28.490 --> 06:57:28.500 align:start position:0%
under that first exemption that's
 
06:57:30.468 --> 06:57:30.478 align:start position:0%
specific to employees
 
06:57:32.150 --> 06:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
but it might be the case the accusation
 
06:57:34.128 --> 06:57:34.138 align:start position:0%
was made of course that they're stealing
 
06:57:35.990 --> 06:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
so maybe the library director comes to
 
06:57:38.150 --> 06:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
the select board and says hey the one of
 
06:57:40.250 --> 06:57:40.260 align:start position:0%
the trustees is stealing money
 
06:57:42.170 --> 06:57:42.180 align:start position:0%
um and at that point the select board
 
06:57:44.090 --> 06:57:44.100 align:start position:0%
enters non-public session under
 
06:57:46.128 --> 06:57:46.138 align:start position:0%
reputation to kick off the investigation
 
06:57:50.048 --> 06:57:50.058 align:start position:0%
of that of that local elected official
 
06:57:53.030 --> 06:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
and because obviously they're not a
 
06:57:54.770 --> 06:57:54.780 align:start position:0%
Public Employee so it does get
 
06:57:54.780 --> 06:57:56.628 align:start position:0%
Public Employee so it does get
complicated

06:57:56.628 --> 06:57:56.638 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
06:58:01.310 --> 06:58:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:05.448 --> 06:58:05.458 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you
 
06:58:12.530 --> 06:58:12.540 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:14.208 --> 06:58:14.218 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you Mr chair
 
06:58:17.030 --> 06:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
Douglas osterhout for oplc uh thank you
 
06:58:19.730 --> 06:58:19.740 align:start position:0%
to the members of the committee for
 
06:58:21.650 --> 06:58:21.660 align:start position:0%
letting me speak today
 
06:58:23.390 --> 06:58:23.400 align:start position:0%
um I was kind of thrown into this bill
 
06:58:25.548 --> 06:58:25.558 align:start position:0%
at the last minute so I have been
 
06:58:28.670 --> 06:58:28.680 align:start position:0%
jotting notes but the oplc does not take
 
06:58:31.070 --> 06:58:31.080 align:start position:0%
a position on this language but we do
 
06:58:33.230 --> 06:58:33.240 align:start position:0%
have a number of concerns I was having a
 
06:58:34.730 --> 06:58:34.740 align:start position:0%
little bit of difficulty hearing I think
 
06:58:36.110 --> 06:58:36.120 align:start position:0%
some of them may have already been
 
06:58:39.590 --> 06:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
addressed but I there's three key things
 
06:58:42.288 --> 06:58:42.298 align:start position:0%
that I've identified right away and one
 
06:58:45.288 --> 06:58:45.298 align:start position:0%
of those again would be individuals who
 
06:58:47.048 --> 06:58:47.058 align:start position:0%
are subject to the complaint under
 
06:58:49.310 --> 06:58:49.320 align:start position:0%
statutes multiple places throughout the
 
06:58:52.610 --> 06:58:52.620 align:start position:0%
statutes complaints under oplc that come
 
06:58:56.270 --> 06:58:56.280 align:start position:0%
to op LC are confidential and what we
 
06:58:58.968 --> 06:58:58.978 align:start position:0%
might have here is a situation where a
 
06:59:00.948 --> 06:59:00.958 align:start position:0%
complaint comes in an investigator at
 
06:59:04.548 --> 06:59:04.558 align:start position:0%
oplc reviews that complaint thinks it's
 
06:59:06.310 --> 06:59:06.320 align:start position:0%
without Merit either there's nothing
 
06:59:09.770 --> 06:59:09.780 align:start position:0%
there's no no claim in that complaint
 
06:59:11.868 --> 06:59:11.878 align:start position:0%
for which relief could be granted or
 
06:59:14.090 --> 06:59:14.100 align:start position:0%
that would be a violation of Statute or
 
06:59:16.910 --> 06:59:16.920 align:start position:0%
Rule and we might bring an investigator
 
06:59:20.030 --> 06:59:20.040 align:start position:0%
before a board and recommend not to
 
06:59:22.788 --> 06:59:22.798 align:start position:0%
proceed with this matter the board would
 
06:59:24.350 --> 06:59:24.360 align:start position:0%
have that discretion they could choose
 
06:59:27.468 --> 06:59:27.478 align:start position:0%
whether to investigate or not and then
 
06:59:29.448 --> 06:59:29.458 align:start position:0%
pending the outcome of an investigation
 
06:59:31.910 --> 06:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
and another recommendation the board
 
06:59:34.490 --> 06:59:34.500 align:start position:0%
would be able to either proceed with
 
06:59:37.610 --> 06:59:37.620 align:start position:0%
discipline or not the way the statutes
 
06:59:40.250 --> 06:59:40.260 align:start position:0%
currently read is until a board decides
 
06:59:42.890 --> 06:59:42.900 align:start position:0%
to move forward with public discipline
 
06:59:46.070 --> 06:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
all of that would be confidential after
 
06:59:48.410 --> 06:59:48.420 align:start position:0%
if a board decides to investigate the
 
06:59:50.270 --> 06:59:50.280 align:start position:0%
matter an individual who's the subject
 
06:59:52.368 --> 06:59:52.378 align:start position:0%
of a complaint would typically be
 
06:59:55.670 --> 06:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
notified there are instances where they
 
06:59:57.830 --> 06:59:57.840 align:start position:0%
happen far and few between but where at
 
07:00:00.350 --> 07:00:00.360 align:start position:0%
the perhaps request of law enforcement
 
07:00:03.288 --> 07:00:03.298 align:start position:0%
and maybe a drug related matter so as
 
07:00:05.270 --> 07:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
not to tip law enforcement's hand they
 
07:00:07.368 --> 07:00:07.378 align:start position:0%
might ask us not to proceed immediately
 
07:00:09.468 --> 07:00:09.478 align:start position:0%
with contacting the subject of the
 
07:00:11.448 --> 07:00:11.458 align:start position:0%
complaint and if a complaint is
 
07:00:14.208 --> 07:00:14.218 align:start position:0%
completely without Merit uh the subject
 
07:00:15.890 --> 07:00:15.900 align:start position:0%
of the complaint may never be aware of
 
07:00:17.628 --> 07:00:17.638 align:start position:0%
that complaint at all
 
07:00:19.430 --> 07:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
um so I just want to put that out there
 
07:00:21.650 --> 07:00:21.660 align:start position:0%
another instance where we might see
 
07:00:25.070 --> 07:00:25.080 align:start position:0%
non-public situations is 10 licensing
 
07:00:27.410 --> 07:00:27.420 align:start position:0%
applications may come in for approval by
 
07:00:29.570 --> 07:00:29.580 align:start position:0%
the board three of those individuals
 
07:00:32.330 --> 07:00:32.340 align:start position:0%
might have a criminal history uh that
 
07:00:33.830 --> 07:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
board might go into non-public to
 
07:00:35.690 --> 07:00:35.700 align:start position:0%
discuss that criminal history mediating
 
07:00:38.090 --> 07:00:38.100 align:start position:0%
factors it might be as simple as you
 
07:00:39.708 --> 07:00:39.718 align:start position:0%
know they got caught shoplifting when
 
07:00:41.930 --> 07:00:41.940 align:start position:0%
they were 18. they haven't had any
 
07:00:44.150 --> 07:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
problems in 20 years
 
07:00:46.250 --> 07:00:46.260 align:start position:0%
we don't see a reason not to approve
 
07:00:48.230 --> 07:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
this individual go back into public
 
07:00:51.170 --> 07:00:51.180 align:start position:0%
these 10 individuals are all approved uh
 
07:00:53.208 --> 07:00:53.218 align:start position:0%
in a case like that if abort did need
 
07:00:56.390 --> 07:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
more information they might call a show
 
07:00:58.548 --> 07:00:58.558 align:start position:0%
cause hearing give the individual an
 
07:00:59.868 --> 07:00:59.878 align:start position:0%
opportunity to come in and explain
 
07:01:02.330 --> 07:01:02.340 align:start position:0%
themselves and and then of course if
 
07:01:03.650 --> 07:01:03.660 align:start position:0%
there's a denial there's always a right
 
07:01:05.810 --> 07:01:05.820 align:start position:0%
to appeal in which case they would get
 
07:01:08.150 --> 07:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
to hear the matter before the board and
 
07:01:11.030 --> 07:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
the other instance I caught and this is
 
07:01:13.070 --> 07:01:13.080 align:start position:0%
a very important one from oplc's
 
07:01:16.490 --> 07:01:16.500 align:start position:0%
perspective I think is that under 541 a
 
07:01:20.030 --> 07:01:20.040 align:start position:0%
30 Roman numeral three if an agency
 
07:01:22.910 --> 07:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
finds that public health safety or
 
07:01:25.850 --> 07:01:25.860 align:start position:0%
welfare requires emergency action and
 
07:01:27.590 --> 07:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
incorporates a finding to that effect
 
07:01:30.468 --> 07:01:30.478 align:start position:0%
they can call a meeting have an ex parte
 
07:01:32.868 --> 07:01:32.878 align:start position:0%
hearing and revoke an individuals and
 
07:01:35.448 --> 07:01:35.458 align:start position:0%
license without notification to the
 
07:01:36.890 --> 07:01:36.900 align:start position:0%
other person because it's an emergency
 
07:01:39.250 --> 07:01:39.260 align:start position:0%
situation and I have seen these happen
 
07:01:42.530 --> 07:01:42.540 align:start position:0%
where the facts are found in the morning
 
07:01:44.990 --> 07:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
the board is contact in the afternoon
 
07:01:47.390 --> 07:01:47.400 align:start position:0%
and there's an extra party hearing the
 
07:01:49.910 --> 07:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
next morning and in those cases an
 
07:01:51.650 --> 07:01:51.660 align:start position:0%
individual has a right to a hearing
 
07:01:54.830 --> 07:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
within 10 days of that process happening
 
07:01:56.510 --> 07:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
so they still get an opportunity to
 
07:01:58.730 --> 07:01:58.740 align:start position:0%
defend themselves but those emergency
 
07:02:01.750 --> 07:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
suspensions can happen very very quickly
 
07:02:03.948 --> 07:02:03.958 align:start position:0%
so those are sort of the concerns that
 
07:02:07.010 --> 07:02:07.020 align:start position:0%
jumped in out to me again oplc does not
 
07:02:08.570 --> 07:02:08.580 align:start position:0%
take a position but we did think we
 
07:02:10.128 --> 07:02:10.138 align:start position:0%
would come and raise some of those
 
07:02:12.708 --> 07:02:12.718 align:start position:0%
issues and I am happy to answer any
 
07:02:14.930 --> 07:02:14.940 align:start position:0%
questions anyone may have questions for
 
07:02:16.548 --> 07:02:16.558 align:start position:0%
this Witness

07:02:50.868 --> 07:02:50.878 align:start position:0%

have any other pink cards but uh
 
07:02:57.948 --> 07:02:57.958 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien I wonder if I
 
07:02:59.990 --> 07:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
could ask you uh one question
 
07:03:02.510 --> 07:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien and that's is I'm
 
07:03:05.868 --> 07:03:05.878 align:start position:0%
uh oh Brian I'm wondering could I we
 
07:03:07.010 --> 07:03:07.020 align:start position:0%
didn't ask you this and I'm just
 
07:03:08.810 --> 07:03:08.820 align:start position:0%
wondering could you tell us
 
07:03:11.990 --> 07:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
are you aware if there are any other
 
07:03:14.810 --> 07:03:14.820 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions in the country that have
 
07:03:18.770 --> 07:03:18.780 align:start position:0%
adopted Provisions like this
 
07:03:21.410 --> 07:03:21.420 align:start position:0%
no I'm not aware of that but I do focus
 
07:03:24.230 --> 07:03:24.240 align:start position:0%
in very closely on where I live and
 
07:03:28.250 --> 07:03:28.260 align:start position:0%
where I have all of my activities so
 
07:03:29.990 --> 07:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
there may be
 
07:03:32.810 --> 07:03:32.820 align:start position:0%
um other places certainly but I spend so
 
07:03:34.910 --> 07:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
much time focused on New Hampshire okay
 
07:03:37.968 --> 07:03:37.978 align:start position:0%
all right I I will add one other thing I
 
07:03:39.770 --> 07:03:39.780 align:start position:0%
wanted to say was
 
07:03:42.110 --> 07:03:42.120 align:start position:0%
that episode
 
07:03:43.850 --> 07:03:43.860 align:start position:0%
felt like
 
07:03:46.128 --> 07:03:46.138 align:start position:0%
a Witch Hunt it felt like I was being
 
07:03:49.548 --> 07:03:49.558 align:start position:0%
scapegoated that my friend and the
 
07:03:51.230 --> 07:03:51.240 align:start position:0%
library trustee from that library was
 
07:03:53.510 --> 07:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
being scapegoated and that it felt like
 
07:03:56.150 --> 07:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
an abuse of power and that I think is
 
07:03:58.368 --> 07:03:58.378 align:start position:0%
something that other people in the state
 
07:04:01.070 --> 07:04:01.080 align:start position:0%
feel all right thank you very much thank
 
07:04:01.080 --> 07:04:02.390 align:start position:0%
