today so the purpose of today's work
 
00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 align:start position:0%
session as a continuation is to go over
 
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 align:start position:0%
a few key areas that weren't uh covered
 
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 align:start position:0%
too deeply the last time we met which by
 
00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 align:start position:0%
the way was Friday February
 
00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 align:start position:0%
21st so I know there is a very well
 
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 align:start position:0%
organized and thoughtful presentation
 
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 align:start position:0%
that we'll go through and the hope is to
 
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 align:start position:0%
cover provisions of house build 2 now
 
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 align:start position:0%
that that has been
 
00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 align:start position:0%
the trigger law discussion on the
 
00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 align:start position:0%
trigger law that New Hampshire has is
 
00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 align:start position:0%
one of very few states that have that
 
00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 align:start position:0%
law and then any other questions or
 
00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 align:start position:0%
concerns since our last work session on
 
00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 align:start position:0%
Medicaid uh that may have gone
 
00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 align:start position:0%
unanswered or we need answers to um to
 
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.350 align:start position:0%
unanswered or we need answers to um to
be

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 align:start position:0%
clarified so we hope to touch upon those
 
00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
as well as other things in the
 
00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 align:start position:0%

morning with I'm Henry Litman the
 
00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319 align:start position:0%
state's Medicaid director so we
 
00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
um we have prepared a
 
00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 align:start position:0%
presentation uh and IT addresses a
 
00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
couple of additional items in addition
 
00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 align:start position:0%
to to what you had indicated
 
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
representative money um and there's two
 
00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 align:start position:0%
handouts in front of you one is all of
 
00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 align:start position:0%
the um the the additional coverages and
 
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 align:start position:0%
rate increases provided um or approved
 
00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:55.879 align:start position:0%
by the legislature and approved by CMS
 
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 align:start position:0%
over the past um 6 years since 2019
 
00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
as as requested and then the second is a
 
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 align:start position:0%
presentation and so I'm going to hand it
 
00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
over to Henry to move us through the
 
00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:08.079 align:start position:0%
presentation and we're hoping as we move
 
00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
through that we'll be able to address
 
00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:17.479 align:start position:0%
questions so in this document the the
 
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 align:start position:0%
actually what would otherwise be a
 
00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 align:start position:0%
PowerPoint document um thankfully it's
 
00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 align:start position:0%
not a PowerPoint um we have uh what we
 
00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
took away from the questions that had
 
00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 align:start position:0%
come up uh as we recorded um from last
 
00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 align:start position:0%
session um one of the things that we
 
00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to do which we hope we achieve
 
00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
with uh the fir in section one is just a
 
00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 align:start position:0%
crosswalk between the adjusted
 
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 align:start position:0%
authorized budget and the governor's
 
00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:48.039 align:start position:0%
budget for 26 the 25 budget versus
 
00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 align:start position:0%
26 um we talked a little bit about how
 
00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:56.919 align:start position:0%
hard it was to um follow the change in
 
00:04:59.469 --> 00:04:59.479 align:start position:0%
how uh the dish program is working so we
 
00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 align:start position:0%
put together an exhibit to um show you
 
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 align:start position:0%
where to find the different pieces so
 
00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:08.759 align:start position:0%
you can put it all together um then we
 
00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 align:start position:0%
have uh that separate handout that uh
 
00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:13.639 align:start position:0%
Nathan referred to a moment ago that
 
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
goes through um service additions and
 
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 align:start position:0%
eligibility changes for the past six
 
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
years um we have some enrollment and
 
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 align:start position:0%
eligibility follow-ups uh based on the
 
00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 align:start position:0%
discussion um we had uh the there was a
 
00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:30.639 align:start position:0%
question about Dental rates we have an
 
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
exhibit to address that and other
 
00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
information which I think uh you're
 
00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.160 align:start position:0%
interest in going through hb2 more
 
00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
specifically now that it's published and
 
00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
that's what we have for today um and so
 
00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:46.600 align:start position:0%
if I could draw your attention to page
 
00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:49.600 align:start position:0%
three and I think um GNA ask Nathan to
 
00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:52.919 align:start position:0%
uh to address that exhibit for us sure
 
00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:55.880 align:start position:0%
so on page three at in the top box there
 
00:05:58.309 --> 00:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
you'll see the state fiscal year 25
 
00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:00.680 align:start position:0%
adjusted authorized and this is
 
00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
representative of the total Medicaid
 
00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:08.560 align:start position:0%
Program and um the adjusted authorized
 
00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
figure you will see is higher than State
 
00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 26 Governor uh recommended
 
00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:17.479 align:start position:0%
budget and in the details below there
 
00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:20.840 align:start position:0%
we've we've listed out the some of the
 
00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:24.039 align:start position:0%
changes that that account for some of
 
00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:24.790 align:start position:0%
changes that that account for some of
those

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:24.800 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:27.400 align:start position:0%
differences um the the reduction in
 
00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:31.199 align:start position:0%
annual Medicare uh management increase
 
00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:33.560 align:start position:0%
so so this is uh coming from accounting
 
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:36.280 align:start position:0%
unit 7948 where we see a lot of the
 
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
changes there this is resulting from the
 
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
premium and some of the return to
 
00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:45.560 align:start position:0%
standard uh to to uh pre-pandemic uh
 
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:48.840 align:start position:0%
eligibility standards there there's the
 
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
pharmacy cost sharing component which
 
00:06:54.309 --> 00:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
also has a corresponding hb2 provision
 
00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
uh which we will uh go through hb2 here
 
00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
in a little bit um there were and here's
 
00:07:02.309 --> 00:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
the return to regular eligibility
 
00:07:05.189 --> 00:07:05.199 align:start position:0%
processing there for the 11.4 million
 
00:07:07.749 --> 00:07:07.759 align:start position:0%
the children's premium up to 5% of
 
00:07:09.869 --> 00:07:09.879 align:start position:0%
household income that's another 3.3
 
00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
million and again I just want to make it
 
00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
clear this is this is for State fiscal
 
00:07:16.029 --> 00:07:16.039 align:start position:0%
year 26 only it's not both years we
 
00:07:17.909 --> 00:07:17.919 align:start position:0%
tried to keep this simple but we also
 
00:07:20.189 --> 00:07:20.199 align:start position:0%
tried to make it as clear as possible so
 
00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
you can kind of crosswalk the
 
00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
differences um the Hamstead change in
 
00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:26.840 align:start position:0%
ownership uh technically we're leasing
 
00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:29.960 align:start position:0%
out Hamstead now uh to Mary Hitchcock
 
00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:32.440 align:start position:0%
Memorial Hospital so the dish dollars
 
00:07:34.189 --> 00:07:34.199 align:start position:0%
were no longer needed to be budget
 
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
budgeted and there's a reduction there
 
00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:40.160 align:start position:0%
um the dcyf residential budget so what
 
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
we what we did here is we had adjusted
 
00:07:46.189 --> 00:07:46.199 align:start position:0%
the amounts within Medicade to be at a
 
00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
5050 level um because this current year
 
00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
uh just due to some of the changes at
 
00:07:52.149 --> 00:07:52.159 align:start position:0%
the federal law some of that had to be
 
00:07:54.029 --> 00:07:54.039 align:start position:0%
paid out at 100% federal funds and
 
00:07:55.909 --> 00:07:55.919 align:start position:0%
that's been moved some of those dollars
 
00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
have been moved to 20 or accounting unit
 
00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.550 align:start position:0%
have been moved to 20 or accounting unit
20

00:07:59.550 --> 00:07:59.560 align:start position:0%
20
 
00:08:02.309 --> 00:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
53 if I'm remembering correctly and we
 
00:08:04.149 --> 00:08:04.159 align:start position:0%
and we will have that crosswalk it's
 
00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:05.800 align:start position:0%
sitting in my email I just haven't had a
 
00:08:07.309 --> 00:08:07.319 align:start position:0%
chance to validate it before I send it
 
00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
over to you so you can see how the
 
00:08:13.029 --> 00:08:13.039 align:start position:0%
residential um contracts are budgeted
 
00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
across multiple Aus I just want to make
 
00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
sure I get that to you and it's correct
 
00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:21.560 align:start position:0%
and then the um below that the updated
 
00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
Community Based Support Services
 
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:25.800 align:start position:0%
utilization this is for uh wraparound
 
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:27.680 align:start position:0%
Services there's been an adjustment
 
00:08:30.149 --> 00:08:30.159 align:start position:0%
there and then the enhanced match under
 
00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:34.399 align:start position:0%
the 80% plan in state fiscal year
 
00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:37.919 align:start position:0%
25 and so when you crosswalk those
 
00:08:41.269 --> 00:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
changes um that that shows you sort of
 
00:08:43.269 --> 00:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
how how we go from the adjusted
 
00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:45.200 align:start position:0%
authorized to the to the governor's
 
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:55.389 --> 00:08:55.399 align:start position:0%
budget I'm hoping that was helpful in
 
00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
terms of trying to piece those pieces
 
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:00.640 align:start position:0%
together yes thank you very much for
 
00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.870 align:start position:0%
together yes thank you very much for
that

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
clarification um if I could Madam sorry
 
00:09:07.829 --> 00:09:07.839 align:start position:0%
representative tarki for a
 
00:09:10.269 --> 00:09:10.279 align:start position:0%
question it's really early since we're
 
00:09:12.829 --> 00:09:12.839 align:start position:0%
starting an hour early so I'm getting my
 
00:09:15.069 --> 00:09:15.079 align:start position:0%
coffee together can we just break it
 
00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
down make sure I fully understand what
 
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:19.240 align:start position:0%
we're looking at here so these numbers
 
00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:24.360 align:start position:0%
are for 26 only 2026 only okay and the
 
00:09:25.829 --> 00:09:25.839 align:start position:0%
for example
 
00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
1.5 million is the savings for the farm
 
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
co-pay cost sharing estimate only yes
 
00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:36.720 align:start position:0%
okay um and one additional point of
 
00:09:40.069 --> 00:09:40.079 align:start position:0%
clarification this represents total
 
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
funds so so in for the pharmacy cost
 
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
sharing component each year it's
 
00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:49.240 align:start position:0%
750,000 General funds but when we do the
 
00:09:50.949 --> 00:09:50.959 align:start position:0%
ma when we add the matching federal
 
00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
dollars we we then it's 1.5 million so
 
00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:56.240 align:start position:0%
so I just want to make sure that just
 
00:09:58.030 --> 00:09:58.040 align:start position:0%
cuz it is early in the morning it's a
 
00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
little earlier than we typically start
 
00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:02.360 align:start position:0%
um it it's the total funds amount that
 
00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:04.160 align:start position:0%
you're looking here looking at right
 
00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:06.680 align:start position:0%
here okay so
 
00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:09.240 align:start position:0%
you're with that logic then you're
 
00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:11.640 align:start position:0%
estimating there will be
 
00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:14.720 align:start position:0%
$750,000 coming in for the pharmacy cost
 
00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
sharing for the first year is that
 
00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:18.920 align:start position:0%
correct am I understanding that
 
00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:29.160 align:start position:0%
um okay I might have more questions but
 
00:10:30.389 --> 00:10:30.399 align:start position:0%
that's helps me just understand what I'm
 
00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:35.000 align:start position:0%
thanks representative Stringham for a
 
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
question yeah so the pharmacy cost
 
00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
sharing is that is that the uh increased
 
00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
co-pay or is that the joint venture um
 
00:10:45.069 --> 00:10:45.079 align:start position:0%
that you were talking about for high
 
00:10:45.079 --> 00:10:45.949 align:start position:0%
that you were talking about for high
cost

00:10:45.949 --> 00:10:45.959 align:start position:0%
cost
 
00:10:48.269 --> 00:10:48.279 align:start position:0%
Pharmaceuticals no that's exclusively
 
00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
the going from $1 to $2 to just four up
 
00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:00.680 align:start position:0%
you representative priest for a question
 
00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Madame Vice chairman um on
 
00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:06.040 align:start position:0%
that second table would it be possible
 
00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:10.160 align:start position:0%
to break down that second column into
 
00:11:12.949 --> 00:11:12.959 align:start position:0%
General funds and federal funds so we
 
00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
know exactly what we're looking at and
 
00:11:17.509 --> 00:11:17.519 align:start position:0%
how much General funds this would be
 
00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:20.600 align:start position:0%
saving uh yes uh we we we can provide
 
00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
that we'll also add a third column with
 
00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
other funds as well okay thank you so
 
00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:32.629 align:start position:0%
other funds as well okay thank you so
much

00:11:32.629 --> 00:11:32.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:36.389 --> 00:11:36.399 align:start position:0%
very good um so if you could go to um
 
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
slide four um which is the Medicaid
 
00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.430 align:start position:0%
slide four um which is the Medicaid
enhancement

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:42.440 align:start position:0%
enhancement
 
00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:47.000 align:start position:0%
tax um we had provided I think the top
 
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
half of this exhibit as part of the
 
00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:51.680 align:start position:0%
prior presentation we added this bottom
 
00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
uh table um so that you could track
 
00:11:59.509 --> 00:11:59.519 align:start position:0%
where the dollars land as a result of
 
00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:03.320 align:start position:0%
moving from paying um completely dish to
 
00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
paying a combination of um higher rates
 
00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
uh directed payments and Dish um and
 
00:12:15.509 --> 00:12:15.519 align:start position:0%
what's reflected in here is the um I
 
00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
think it's colloquially known as the 80%
 
00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
plan which um where things landed at the
 
00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:24.760 align:start position:0%
end of last uh legislative session and
 
00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:27.680 align:start position:0%
representative Nano has a question yeah
 
00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
I apologize I'm still like quite awake
 
00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:34.720 align:start position:0%
awake yet either but this is a a a
 
00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:37.240 align:start position:0%
question and maybe there's no answer to
 
00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
it but uh if you had any indication that
 
00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:41.320 align:start position:0%
there going to be changes in the
 
00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion side of it and and
 
00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:46.240 align:start position:0%
whether you've looked at any
 
00:12:48.949 --> 00:12:48.959 align:start position:0%
sensitivities uh because of the existing
 
00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:50.680 align:start position:0%
uh legislation in New Hampshire that if
 
00:12:54.389 --> 00:12:54.399 align:start position:0%
the 10% if less than 90% of federal
 
00:12:57.949 --> 00:12:57.959 align:start position:0%
funds comes under that program that goes
 
00:12:59.949 --> 00:12:59.959 align:start position:0%
away the
 
00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:02.120 align:start position:0%
if I could uh you're really addressing
 
00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:04.600 align:start position:0%
the trigger law that's in current law
 
00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:06.760 align:start position:0%
yeah exactly and
 
00:13:09.829 --> 00:13:09.839 align:start position:0%
um chair person you had mentioned there
 
00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
are a few states there actually I
 
00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
believe 10 or more now that have a
 
00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
trigger law in the in the US um and so
 
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
what that says under our statute is that
 
00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
should the the federal match go below
 
00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:27.240 align:start position:0%
90% there's a certain period very short
 
00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:29.800 align:start position:0%
period of time I think it may be 10 days
 
00:13:32.829 --> 00:13:32.839 align:start position:0%
or 5 days to alert the legislature and
 
00:13:37.069 --> 00:13:37.079 align:start position:0%
legislative leadership and then um 180
 
00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
day U wind down of the program um I
 
00:13:43.389 --> 00:13:43.399 align:start position:0%
think that also gives the legislature if
 
00:13:46.269 --> 00:13:46.279 align:start position:0%
they so chose to look at whether they
 
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
want to do anything different depending
 
00:13:51.509 --> 00:13:51.519 align:start position:0%
on how much the 90% goes
 
00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
down so my my question is is that you
 
00:13:58.189 --> 00:13:58.199 align:start position:0%
know um given the fact that we have that
 
00:14:01.629 --> 00:14:01.639 align:start position:0%
existing trigger in the legislation and
 
00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:03.320 align:start position:0%
for planning purposes have you all
 
00:14:05.829 --> 00:14:05.839 align:start position:0%
looked at a sensitivity case that uh
 
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
that addresses that possibility um I
 
00:14:12.069 --> 00:14:12.079 align:start position:0%
think we have sort of at a at a a global
 
00:14:14.629 --> 00:14:14.639 align:start position:0%
level I mean I think that um there's so
 
00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
many different scenarios right now we
 
00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:20.680 align:start position:0%
know that if it goes below 90% current
 
00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
law is that it ends unless there's a
 
00:14:25.749 --> 00:14:25.759 align:start position:0%
legislative action to make it different
 
00:14:29.829 --> 00:14:29.839 align:start position:0%
um and so we all the funding there um
 
00:14:31.949 --> 00:14:31.959 align:start position:0%
give me a
 
00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:41.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:47.829 --> 00:14:47.839 align:start position:0%
damage so in um State fisol year 25 um
 
00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
you know the the total cost of that
 
00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
program which is um by legislative
 
00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
design um is not on budget um is uh
 
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
expecting to spend and um in program
 
00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:01.910 align:start position:0%
expecting to spend and um in program
costs

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
costs
 
00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
620 um1 million just for rounding um and
 
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
that uh the um the 90% match generates
 
00:15:13.509 --> 00:15:13.519 align:start position:0%
um about
 
00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
582 thou 582 million um and then there's
 
00:15:20.069 --> 00:15:20.079 align:start position:0%
a remainder amount which is funded by a
 
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
combination of um premium taxes that are
 
00:15:27.069 --> 00:15:27.079 align:start position:0%
on the policies themselves um there's
 
00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:29.519 align:start position:0%
also a component from from liquor
 
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
currently and there's also a component
 
00:15:33.309 --> 00:15:33.319 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire health plan which
 
00:15:35.949 --> 00:15:35.959 align:start position:0%
is sort of the high historic high-risk
 
00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
pool and so that the difference between
 
00:15:41.269 --> 00:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
the 620 and the 582 comes from
 
00:15:44.629 --> 00:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:47.069 --> 00:15:47.079 align:start position:0%
sources okay so the answer is you have
 
00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
at least looked at that on a on a high
 
00:15:51.949 --> 00:15:51.959 align:start position:0%
level level as what the potential impact
 
00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
of that would be not withstanding the
 
00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
fact that it has a lot of arms and legs
 
00:15:58.069 --> 00:15:58.079 align:start position:0%
on it in terms of you know the wh ifs
 
00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:01.240 align:start position:0%
and what the legis might do or not do
 
00:16:05.069 --> 00:16:05.079 align:start position:0%
correct thank you so just to clarify the
 
00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:10.240 align:start position:0%
trigger law is a chapter law section 342
 
00:16:14.269 --> 00:16:14.279 align:start position:0%
colon 12 uh of 2018
 
00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
correct representative tki for a
 
00:16:18.629 --> 00:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
question yeah I am just curious um
 
00:16:19.829 --> 00:16:19.839 align:start position:0%
because we started talking about the
 
00:16:21.829 --> 00:16:21.839 align:start position:0%
Medicaid enhancement tax did you have
 
00:16:23.309 --> 00:16:23.319 align:start position:0%
more information prepared on the trigger
 
00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:25.000 align:start position:0%
law that we can wait and get to that
 
00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:27.880 align:start position:0%
later I just don't want to disrupt your
 
00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
your flow no I don't think there's much
 
00:16:31.949 --> 00:16:31.959 align:start position:0%
more to the trigger law other than that
 
00:16:35.269 --> 00:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
that basically if the federal government
 
00:16:38.629 --> 00:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
reduces the 90% the law says we have to
 
00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
notify legislative leadership um I think
 
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
it may be five days um and then we have
 
00:16:48.269 --> 00:16:48.279 align:start position:0%
to notify the the people who have the
 
00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
benefit that um it is scheduled to end
 
00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:55.240 align:start position:0%
in 180 days the 180 days I think is
 
00:16:57.509 --> 00:16:57.519 align:start position:0%
where the legislature could if it so
 
00:17:00.069 --> 00:17:00.079 align:start position:0%
chose to do something
 
00:17:03.669 --> 00:17:03.679 align:start position:0%
um while this may be
 
00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:07.720 align:start position:0%
premature um is there and I think this
 
00:17:09.909 --> 00:17:09.919 align:start position:0%
may connect a little bit to the
 
00:17:13.429 --> 00:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
questions that were just asked um is
 
00:17:16.189 --> 00:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
there any way there could be some kind
 
00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:21.400 align:start position:0%
of look at data that says if we drop to
 
00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:24.360 align:start position:0%
88% funding the state would need to find
 
00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
x amount of money if we drop to 85%
 
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
funding the state would need to find x
 
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
amount of funding or the variables just
 
00:17:33.789 --> 00:17:33.799 align:start position:0%
too extreme that we can't even talk
 
00:17:36.669 --> 00:17:36.679 align:start position:0%
about those hypothetical
 
00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
situations so um since there's a
 
00:17:42.029 --> 00:17:42.039 align:start position:0%
Prohibition um which is not part of the
 
00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
trigger law but generally for uh the
 
00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:46.120 align:start position:0%
granted Advantage Program there's a
 
00:17:48.669 --> 00:17:48.679 align:start position:0%
Prohibition against General funds so
 
00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:51.720 align:start position:0%
looking to the sources of where we could
 
00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:54.720 align:start position:0%
get additional funding as it under
 
00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:57.720 align:start position:0%
current law is is really the the three
 
00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
sources that I mentioned and um you know
 
00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
the liquor fund which you know to my
 
00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:05.320 align:start position:0%
understanding there's you know there's
 
00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:09.080 align:start position:0%
um the growth in that revenue is not um
 
00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:11.400 align:start position:0%
as great as we'd like it to be um there
 
00:18:15.149 --> 00:18:15.159 align:start position:0%
is the the premium tax which is fixed
 
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
based on the policies and then under
 
00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:19.640 align:start position:0%
current law there's also the New
 
00:18:22.149 --> 00:18:22.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Health pl's contribution is
 
00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
fixed to no more than 50% of what liquor
 
00:18:30.909 --> 00:18:30.919 align:start position:0%
revenue and premium tax does so it may
 
00:18:33.549 --> 00:18:33.559 align:start position:0%
to put more money in there is also a
 
00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
provision um under um from 2019
 
00:18:42.909 --> 00:18:42.919 align:start position:0%
hb4 uh that allowed uh the the
 
00:18:45.029 --> 00:18:45.039 align:start position:0%
department to request additional liquor
 
00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
funds which um happened during the
 
00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
pandemic when the enrollment went from
 
00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:53.000 align:start position:0%
you know in the low 50,000 to over
 
00:18:55.909 --> 00:18:55.919 align:start position:0%
96,000 that um there was a need to tap
 
00:18:58.909 --> 00:18:58.919 align:start position:0%
into that um so there is something on
 
00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
the books that gives a little bit but
 
00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:04.280 align:start position:0%
that's um you know I'm not sure how much
 
00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:08.200 align:start position:0%
really you know liquor could afford um
 
00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:10.280 align:start position:0%
based on what legislature decides to do
 
00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:13.320 align:start position:0%
with money from liquor profits um that
 
00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:14.600 align:start position:0%
could be done there so I think that's
 
00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
the limiting factor in terms of what
 
00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
would be under current legislation well
 
00:19:21.149 --> 00:19:21.159 align:start position:0%
to be fair if there's limiting factor
 
00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:23.320 align:start position:0%
that we need to take action and change
 
00:19:27.029 --> 00:19:27.039 align:start position:0%
the statute to be able to um fix the
 
00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:28.760 align:start position:0%
trigger law then we can change the stat
 
00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
statute to what funds are used is that
 
00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:34.720 align:start position:0%
accurate I I think that the statute can
 
00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
be changed if you so choose I mean I
 
00:19:39.149 --> 00:19:39.159 align:start position:0%
think that is it could be done
 
00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
proactively or it could be done upon
 
00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:44.720 align:start position:0%
upon action in that 180 day period but
 
00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:46.520 align:start position:0%
here again depending on when that 180
 
00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
day period came into effect you know
 
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
which is why I'm asking these questions
 
00:19:54.029 --> 00:19:54.039 align:start position:0%
now for fear of the granted Staters are
 
00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:56.320 align:start position:0%
going to be affected by this okay that
 
00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
answers my questions I'm going to have a
 
00:19:59.270 --> 00:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
lot more though so
 
00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:00.440 align:start position:0%
I don't want to distract from where
 
00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:02.600 align:start position:0%
we're going if I could add one thing in
 
00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:05.200 align:start position:0%
terms of the timing of this I think that
 
00:20:07.909 --> 00:20:07.919 align:start position:0%
it's likely that it appears that there's
 
00:20:11.149 --> 00:20:11.159 align:start position:0%
the um there's the avoidance of the
 
00:20:14.149 --> 00:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
government shutdown which is the um
 
00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:15.880 align:start position:0%
continuing resolution and there's the
 
00:20:18.149 --> 00:20:18.159 align:start position:0%
budget reconciliation I think the budget
 
00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:21.280 align:start position:0%
reconciliation we may not know how that
 
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
lands until the fall in terms of knowing
 
00:20:26.149 --> 00:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
for sure just just so you have a sense
 
00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:34.240 align:start position:0%
what I see here in the chapter law uh
 
00:20:37.029 --> 00:20:37.039 align:start position:0%
with regards to timing it says within 48
 
00:20:38.549 --> 00:20:38.559 align:start position:0%
hours after the event under this
 
00:20:40.029 --> 00:20:40.039 align:start position:0%
paragraph has occurred notify the
 
00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
governor the speaker of the house and
 
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
the president of the Senate and the
 
00:20:44.909 --> 00:20:44.919 align:start position:0%
chairperson of the legislative fiscal
 
00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:47.080 align:start position:0%
Committee of the program's pending
 
00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
termination that's what you were
 
00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
referring to yes that was even quicker
 
00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:52.360 align:start position:0%
than I thought and then it goes on to
 
00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
say within 10 business days after the
 
00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:56.200 align:start position:0%
event in this paragraph has occurred
 
00:20:58.789 --> 00:20:58.799 align:start position:0%
notify program participant
 
00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:01.360 align:start position:0%
participants of the program's pending
 
00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
termination that's coming uh from the
 
00:21:07.149 --> 00:21:07.159 align:start position:0%
chapter law I cited
 
00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
earlier is also sorry I didn't mean
 
00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:11.200 align:start position:0%
interrupt you and then what's the direct
 
00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:13.880 align:start position:0%
wording for the termination date was it
 
00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:17.480 align:start position:0%
180 days that you said
 
00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
yes you you should see that there
 
00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:22.480 align:start position:0%
somewhere if it's not there it might be
 
00:21:25.029 --> 00:21:25.039 align:start position:0%
in a different part of that 342 chapter
 
00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:27.080 align:start position:0%
we can give you the reference uh pull
 
00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:28.760 align:start position:0%
that out for you and provide that to
 
00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
great and I do see here
 
00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
um and this is mid sentence so uh hereby
 
00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:39.080 align:start position:0%
repealed 180 days after the event under
 
00:21:40.669 --> 00:21:40.679 align:start position:0%
this paragraph occurs upon the
 
00:21:42.549 --> 00:21:42.559 align:start position:0%
notification by the commissioner of the
 
00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:43.960 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
to the Secretary of State and the
 
00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:47.960 align:start position:0%
director of legislative services and
 
00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
then it goes on from there it's about
 
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
mid paragraph that's where I see where
 
00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:55.400 align:start position:0%
180 occurs you found it okay real good
 
00:21:57.990 --> 00:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
representative Neno for a question yeah
 
00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
just a a quick question the Medicaid
 
00:22:03.549 --> 00:22:03.559 align:start position:0%
expansion piece of it covers uh how many
 
00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:07.320 align:start position:0%
people today uh uh we have uh exact
 
00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
statistics for March 3rd but it's like
 
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
just under 59,000
 
00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:15.200 align:start position:0%
today and um over the course of the last
 
00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:18.440 align:start position:0%
year about 87,000 individuals have been
 
00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
in the program and over the life of the
 
00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:23.000 align:start position:0%
program um over a quarter of a million
 
00:22:25.149 --> 00:22:25.159 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire residents have had some
 
00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:27.480 align:start position:0%
time on the program the average tenure
 
00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
on the program today is is less than one
 
00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:31.720 align:start position:0%
year that's not to say there's people
 
00:22:33.789 --> 00:22:33.799 align:start position:0%
that don't stay on for a period of years
 
00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
but the average tenure is less than a
 
00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
year so so are those numbers decre
 
00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:41.720 align:start position:0%
postco those numbers are they've come
 
00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:44.320 align:start position:0%
down decreasing excuse me um they have
 
00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:47.000 align:start position:0%
come down from the high of 90 almost
 
00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
97,000 to today just under 60 and it
 
00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:53.320 align:start position:0%
seems to have leveled off on on that one
 
00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:55.720 align:start position:0%
thing I would comment on though is what
 
00:22:59.590 --> 00:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
we've seen is that um
 
00:23:02.909 --> 00:23:02.919 align:start position:0%
individuals who have disabilities that
 
00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:04.559 align:start position:0%
there I think that there's been a trend
 
00:23:07.149 --> 00:23:07.159 align:start position:0%
for people to take advantage of um
 
00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
getting on getting at least their health
 
00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
insurance while they're waiting for
 
00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
maybe um a waiver to come into play so
 
00:23:15.029 --> 00:23:15.039 align:start position:0%
that I think some of the increases
 
00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
related to that some of the increase
 
00:23:20.029 --> 00:23:20.039 align:start position:0%
that we're seeing is um some of the
 
00:23:22.149 --> 00:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
individuals who are pregnant um who have
 
00:23:24.789 --> 00:23:24.799 align:start position:0%
postpartum coverage now for 12 months
 
00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:27.640 align:start position:0%
that there's a portion there and then um
 
00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:32.600 align:start position:0%
parent uh parent U child uh parent
 
00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
caretakers excuse me eligibility group
 
00:23:37.149 --> 00:23:37.159 align:start position:0%
that we see um some increase in
 
00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:39.440 align:start position:0%
individuals using that and the reason I
 
00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:40.760 align:start position:0%
think we see that is that the
 
00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:42.440 align:start position:0%
eligibility criteria for granted
 
00:23:45.789 --> 00:23:45.799 align:start position:0%
Advantage is purely um um your gross
 
00:23:48.549 --> 00:23:48.559 align:start position:0%
adjusted income and
 
00:23:52.269 --> 00:23:52.279 align:start position:0%
um which sometimes is referred to as
 
00:23:57.029 --> 00:23:57.039 align:start position:0%
Magi so very quick fall so that suggests
 
00:23:58.990 --> 00:23:59.000 align:start position:0%
to me that a that a portion of of this
 
00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
that me you may still see declines
 
00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
because a portion of this is transitory
 
00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
the the yeah we our expectation is it's
 
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
going to land somewhere in the lower
 
00:24:11.669 --> 00:24:11.679 align:start position:0%
50,000 ultimately but you know I think
 
00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
that we need some more experience it's
 
00:24:16.149 --> 00:24:16.159 align:start position:0%
really less than a not much more than a
 
00:24:18.269 --> 00:24:18.279 align:start position:0%
year that we finish the unwind and and
 
00:24:20.149 --> 00:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
trying to get a sense of the statistics
 
00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
of how people are using it as sort of a
 
00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:25.000 align:start position:0%
first step potentially to get some
 
00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:26.200 align:start position:0%
Health Care coverage while they're
 
00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
waiting for a waiver or disability
 
00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
determination disability determination
 
00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
take a while thank you and just want to
 
00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
remind um everyone watching or listening
 
00:24:39.789 --> 00:24:39.799 align:start position:0%
here that we are discussing uh what's
 
00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
known as the trigger law in chapter laws
 
00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
uh here in New Hampshire there's been no
 
00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:47.720 align:start position:0%
action uh that we need to take that
 
00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
would trigger this we are Simply Having
 
00:24:54.269 --> 00:24:54.279 align:start position:0%
a discussion related to what this
 
00:24:56.269 --> 00:24:56.279 align:start position:0%
chapter law
 
00:24:58.909 --> 00:24:58.919 align:start position:0%
says representative priest for question
 
00:25:03.389 --> 00:25:03.399 align:start position:0%
could you also cite the um statute and
 
00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
sections again for
 
00:25:12.789 --> 00:25:12.799 align:start position:0%
us yes this is a chapter law section
 
00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:15.320 align:start position:0%
342 colon
 
00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
2018 thank you ma'am and as for a
 
00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:25.510 align:start position:0%
2018 thank you ma'am and as for a
corresponding

00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
corresponding
 
00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:28.840 align:start position:0%
RSA it seems there is isn't one
 
00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:30.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunately this is the sort of thing
 
00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:32.200 align:start position:0%
that probably should have gone into RSA
 
00:25:33.909 --> 00:25:33.919 align:start position:0%
because it was intended to be permanent
 
00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
however it's only in chapter
 
00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
law representative tersi for question so
 
00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:43.320 align:start position:0%
last um bium in hb2 when we put in the
 
00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:47.320 align:start position:0%
sunset the seven-year Sunset um isn't
 
00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
that in chapter law which I thought had
 
00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:51.480 align:start position:0%
language to the
 
00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
trigger um I need to look up that one I
 
00:25:56.389 --> 00:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
don't recall where it went um I don't
 
00:25:58.510 --> 00:25:58.520 align:start position:0%
think there was any language in that Rel
 
00:26:02.389 --> 00:26:02.399 align:start position:0%
to the federal trigger though I think
 
00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:05.080 align:start position:0%
okay I guess we discussed it and debated
 
00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:06.520 align:start position:0%
to hopefully get rid of the trigger and
 
00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:13.880 align:start position:0%
okay if I could Mr my recollection of
 
00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:17.440 align:start position:0%
hp2 was that the changes that made it in
 
00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
there were to address the
 
00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
seven-year and then the sunset and and
 
00:26:26.110 --> 00:26:26.120 align:start position:0%
and some of the funding with respect to
 
00:26:28.669 --> 00:26:28.679 align:start position:0%
where liquor money went um outside of
 
00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
the manage outside of the Medicaid
 
00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
Program and the hospital contribution
 
00:26:36.029 --> 00:26:36.039 align:start position:0%
which at one point was allowed but then
 
00:26:37.909 --> 00:26:37.919 align:start position:0%
wasn't allowed by the
 
00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:40.200 align:start position:0%
federal okay that makes sense
 
00:26:42.149 --> 00:26:42.159 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham for a question
 
00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:45.200 align:start position:0%
yeah well I was also going to um yeah
 
00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:47.720 align:start position:0%
say this this the program sunsets in
 
00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:49.960 align:start position:0%
seven years as you just said from that
 
00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
and the the uh both the placement and
 
00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:55.960 align:start position:0%
the location of the uh the trigger was
 
00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
under considerable debate and it was
 
00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:58.950 align:start position:0%
under considerable debate and it was
even

00:26:58.950 --> 00:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
even
 
00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
uh you know argued on the house floor of
 
00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
whether the trigger law was still in
 
00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
effect or not uh and ultimately I think
 
00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:09.320 align:start position:0%
we decided the trigger trigger law was
 
00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:13.240 align:start position:0%
still still in in effect so which is you
 
00:27:15.789 --> 00:27:15.799 align:start position:0%
agree with so yes um anything about that
 
00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
that's inconsistent with your
 
00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:28.269 --> 00:27:28.279 align:start position:0%
you thank you you may proceed um so I
 
00:27:30.389 --> 00:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
think we were on uh page four at the
 
00:27:33.789 --> 00:27:33.799 align:start position:0%
bottom was um just showing where the
 
00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:37.240 align:start position:0%
Medicaid enhancement tax um and and the
 
00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
revenues for that are are currently
 
00:27:41.909 --> 00:27:41.919 align:start position:0%
accounted for
 
00:27:44.669 --> 00:27:44.679 align:start position:0%
um as we mentioned before when things
 
00:27:47.149 --> 00:27:47.159 align:start position:0%
move from being just paid out as a
 
00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
disproportionate share payment for
 
00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care and instead put the
 
00:27:54.549 --> 00:27:54.559 align:start position:0%
Met um partially into rates and
 
00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
partially into directed payments so that
 
00:27:58.789 --> 00:27:58.799 align:start position:0%
we could obtain the more favorable
 
00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:01.480 align:start position:0%
Federal match it just you see great
 
00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
differences between prior years and this
 
00:28:07.149 --> 00:28:07.159 align:start position:0%
is an attempt to um if you will give you
 
00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
a program to to check which page where
 
00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
those dollars ended up and on the right
 
00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
hand far right hand side of the table um
 
00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:16.760 align:start position:0%
you'll see that I will note the granted
 
00:28:19.269 --> 00:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
Advantage Health Care Program local
 
00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:21.720 align:start position:0%
funds you'll see an NA again because
 
00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:29.669 --> 00:28:29.679 align:start position:0%
budget representative tki for a question
 
00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:33.720 align:start position:0%
thanks um so I think you said that these
 
00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
numbers in 26 and 27 reflect
 
00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
80% like the um the Medicaid enhancement
 
00:28:47.789 --> 00:28:47.799 align:start position:0%
tax itself is the Top Line there the 286
 
00:28:52.789 --> 00:28:52.799 align:start position:0%
the 337 the 350 those uh were the the
 
00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
governor's budget um if you will the the
 
00:28:58.430 --> 00:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
tax that was collected uh and then below
 
00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
the the use of those funds um reflects
 
00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:05.789 align:start position:0%
the the use of those funds um reflects
the

00:29:05.789 --> 00:29:05.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:10.509 --> 00:29:10.519 align:start position:0%
80% so in 25 that would have been the
 
00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
sorry the older um figures in the older
 
00:29:16.269 --> 00:29:16.279 align:start position:0%
calculations no in the adjusted
 
00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
authorized no so um in in
 
00:29:22.669 --> 00:29:22.679 align:start position:0%
25 again at the end of last session what
 
00:29:33.549 --> 00:29:33.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
um I would add a a footnote here not to
 
00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:39.240 align:start position:0%
add any confusion um the Medicaid
 
00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:42.360 align:start position:0%
enhancement tax um and we've provided
 
00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
this information to Kevin in terms of
 
00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
what the um hospitals reported
 
00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:52.600 align:start position:0%
um they make a non-binding estimate for
 
00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh for the upcoming um payment due in
 
00:29:59.830 --> 00:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
April that it was a l over 348 million
 
00:30:06.029 --> 00:30:06.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:10.789 --> 00:30:10.799 align:start position:0%
level 20 24 tax year paid in 25 can I
 
00:30:13.509 --> 00:30:13.519 align:start position:0%
ask a quick question and and sort of if
 
00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:20.320 align:start position:0%
you follow um on page five um we have
 
00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
the on the left hand side the the top
 
00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
line of
 
00:30:28.029 --> 00:30:28.039 align:start position:0%
numbers uh the originally U the budget
 
00:30:29.789 --> 00:30:29.799 align:start position:0%
amount was uh
 
00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:31.640 align:start position:0%
319 uh
 
00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:36.200 align:start position:0%
255 360 represented what um would go to
 
00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:39.640 align:start position:0%
the hospitals under the 80% plan and the
 
00:30:43.310 --> 00:30:43.320 align:start position:0%
63 840 is what's represented would come
 
00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:45.440 align:start position:0%
to um the Department of Health and Human
 
00:30:47.029 --> 00:30:47.039 align:start position:0%
Services this is not the federally
 
00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
matched amount this is just the the
 
00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:53.320 align:start position:0%
Medicaid enhancement tax amount um and
 
00:30:56.909 --> 00:30:56.919 align:start position:0%
then down below that um you know going
 
00:30:58.789 --> 00:30:58.799 align:start position:0%
again horizontally
 
00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:02.240 align:start position:0%
the the non-binding estimate uh that was
 
00:31:06.029 --> 00:31:06.039 align:start position:0%
provided in January the 348 million um
 
00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
at an 80 um percent would be
 
00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:12.440 align:start position:0%
278 and the balance to the state is the
 
00:31:16.389 --> 00:31:16.399 align:start position:0%
69 and then the last line is the change
 
00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
between the two numbers above in each of
 
00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:19.990 align:start position:0%
between the two numbers above in each of
the

00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:31:23.789 --> 00:31:23.799 align:start position:0%
columns and then that's repeated in 26
 
00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
and 27 and then what I would note there
 
00:31:30.509 --> 00:31:30.519 align:start position:0%
is that based on
 
00:31:33.710 --> 00:31:33.720 align:start position:0%
25 um you know we've looked at what
 
00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
rating agencies have said about what's
 
00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:39.720 align:start position:0%
the trends in hospital revenues um and
 
00:31:42.549 --> 00:31:42.559 align:start position:0%
um you know basically reflect that
 
00:31:44.629 --> 00:31:44.639 align:start position:0%
likely we're going to see 4% higher than
 
00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
what we saw in um in the assuming the
 
00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:51.200 align:start position:0%
the non-binding estimate comes in as we
 
00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:55.480 align:start position:0%
expected to um it would be we would be
 
00:31:57.909 --> 00:31:57.919 align:start position:0%
expecting more than what was in the the
 
00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:01.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:05.240 align:start position:0%
budget okay any questions on
 
00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
that representative tki for a question
 
00:32:11.669 --> 00:32:11.679 align:start position:0%
so I'm just wondering if um when working
 
00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:14.440 align:start position:0%
out the
 
00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
projections if there is consideration
 
00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:19.960 align:start position:0%
for an increase in uncompensated care
 
00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
based on the policy changes proposed in
 
00:32:27.029 --> 00:32:27.039 align:start position:0%
hb2 for Medicaid premiums and the
 
00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:29.720 align:start position:0%
assumed drop off that we have
 
00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
discussed um so actually that's a good
 
00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
lead into the very next slide I will
 
00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
step back then thank you um I just
 
00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to make mention and I'm looking
 
00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
for it uh I can't put my finger on it
 
00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
but there is a Senate bill right now
 
00:32:46.549 --> 00:32:46.559 align:start position:0%
pending regarding this assessment tax uh
 
00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
that may very well be headed our way I
 
00:32:49.509 --> 00:32:49.519 align:start position:0%
don't know if you have any comment to
 
00:32:53.149 --> 00:32:53.159 align:start position:0%
that I know Senator birdell is the one
 
00:32:55.549 --> 00:32:55.559 align:start position:0%
and only sponsor I believe that's the
 
00:32:58.350 --> 00:32:58.360 align:start position:0%
bill I'm referring to Yes um it's Senate
 
00:32:58.360 --> 00:32:59.789 align:start position:0%
bill I'm referring to Yes um it's Senate
Bill

00:32:59.789 --> 00:32:59.799 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:04.200 align:start position:0%
249 and um it has the policy committee
 
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
is passing it on to to finance they
 
00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
didn't do anything more than what was in
 
00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
that uh bill which still maintain the
 
00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:16.240 align:start position:0%
80% it's going to Senate Finance uh I
 
00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
believe in the near
 
00:33:20.269 --> 00:33:20.279 align:start position:0%
future real good thank you
 
00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
representative Neno for a question yeah
 
00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
just a a very quick question so any to
 
00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:28.600 align:start position:0%
the extent that that uh the me
 
00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
overperforms that winds back up in the
 
00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:32.190 align:start position:0%
overperforms that winds back up in the
general

00:33:32.190 --> 00:33:32.200 align:start position:0%
general
 
00:33:36.149 --> 00:33:36.159 align:start position:0%
fund the Prat share that is under an 80%
 
00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:39.880 align:start position:0%
plan 20% of it would um the other
 
00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
portion what's under current law would
 
00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
always be 80% of whatever came in would
 
00:33:49.029 --> 00:33:49.039 align:start position:0%
create the pool for the hospitals uh so
 
00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:50.720 align:start position:0%
it isn't like every dollar that comes in
 
00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:53.480 align:start position:0%
is really 20 cents on a dollar that but
 
00:33:55.149 --> 00:33:55.159 align:start position:0%
that that doesn't wind back up in the
 
00:33:59.389 --> 00:33:59.399 align:start position:0%
general fund um well it it does in in
 
00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:01.880 align:start position:0%
part uh for the portion of services that
 
00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:06.720 align:start position:0%
are um again this is another um tweak to
 
00:34:10.589 --> 00:34:10.599 align:start position:0%
the law that was made I think in 2020 or
 
00:34:14.470 --> 00:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
2021 that um a portion of of the
 
00:34:16.430 --> 00:34:16.440 align:start position:0%
Medicaid enhancement tax that is paid
 
00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
out and enhanced directed payments to
 
00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:22.760 align:start position:0%
hospitals that those funds can be the
 
00:34:24.629 --> 00:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
Medicaid enhancement tax dollars can be
 
00:34:29.589 --> 00:34:29.599 align:start position:0%
used to um to cover that because
 
00:34:33.589 --> 00:34:33.599 align:start position:0%
um to to make those payments to the
 
00:34:36.589 --> 00:34:36.599 align:start position:0%
hospitals so so it's h held out for and
 
00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:39.320 align:start position:0%
accounted for separately yeah it's um I
 
00:34:42.069 --> 00:34:42.079 align:start position:0%
I think I have it on one of the line
 
00:34:43.950 --> 00:34:43.960 align:start position:0%
items here I believe
 
00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:45.790 align:start position:0%
items here I believe
it's

00:34:45.790 --> 00:34:45.800 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:34:51.629 --> 00:34:51.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:51.639 --> 00:34:54.710 align:start position:0%
 
it9

00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:57.750 --> 00:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
med to fund it
 
00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
you have it to yeah to grage
 
00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:02.670 align:start position:0%
you have it to yeah to grage
yeah

00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:02.680 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:35:05.349 --> 00:35:05.359 align:start position:0%
yeah it's approximately $9 million I can
 
00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
come back give you an exact number um of
 
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
the proceeds to that go into uh funding
 
00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:13.589 align:start position:0%
the proceeds to that go into uh funding
the

00:35:13.589 --> 00:35:13.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:16.440 align:start position:0%
program okay thank
 
00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:17.990 align:start position:0%
program okay thank
you

00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
um going back to where representative
 
00:35:26.069 --> 00:35:26.079 align:start position:0%
tki was was heading um on page um
 
00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:30.280 align:start position:0%
six so the amount of uncompensated care
 
00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
that states are able to pay out is each
 
00:35:37.349 --> 00:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
state gets a dish allotment um New
 
00:35:40.349 --> 00:35:40.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's dish allotment um if
 
00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:42.880 align:start position:0%
Congress does not act there's currently
 
00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
a congressional along the books that
 
00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
says that state there um as a result of
 
00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
of the ACA you know and and Medicaid
 
00:35:55.870 --> 00:35:55.880 align:start position:0%
expansion that that there should be less
 
00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:00.640 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care and so um in the
 
00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
continuing resolution there was a
 
00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
temporary 4month extension of a pause in
 
00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:09.800 align:start position:0%
in that reduction so New Hampshire if
 
00:36:11.950 --> 00:36:11.960 align:start position:0%
Congress does not act on that would see
 
00:36:16.109 --> 00:36:16.119 align:start position:0%
a reduction of a 139 million out of a
 
00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
out of a um a pool that's approximately
 
00:36:22.309 --> 00:36:22.319 align:start position:0%
230 million so we would only have
 
00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
available to us 905 million to make um
 
00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care payments that's why
 
00:36:31.589 --> 00:36:31.599 align:start position:0%
we've been moving towards the higher
 
00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:34.160 align:start position:0%
payment rates and directed payments and
 
00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:36.760 align:start position:0%
I think the the question there is you
 
00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:39.640 align:start position:0%
know like many things Congress doesn't
 
00:36:42.910 --> 00:36:42.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily always um continue what
 
00:36:44.309 --> 00:36:44.319 align:start position:0%
they're tring to do it when they
 
00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:47.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes delay um and you know I think
 
00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
the the perspective has been thus far to
 
00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
you know pause it a bit but I think
 
00:36:56.430 --> 00:36:56.440 align:start position:0%
given what uh Congress is potentially
 
00:36:59.870 --> 00:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
looking for for for a deficit reduction
 
00:37:01.829 --> 00:37:01.839 align:start position:0%
you know I think there's some risk here
 
00:37:04.309 --> 00:37:04.319 align:start position:0%
that we could see less of that so that's
 
00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:08.920 align:start position:0%
why um putting um the Met dollars into
 
00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
directed payments and uh payment rates
 
00:37:16.270 --> 00:37:16.280 align:start position:0%
is is a good thing to a point um and
 
00:37:19.829 --> 00:37:19.839 align:start position:0%
that um some level of of uncompensated
 
00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
care in the form of dish payments for
 
00:37:24.589 --> 00:37:24.599 align:start position:0%
the hospitals is a good thing and the
 
00:37:28.069 --> 00:37:28.079 align:start position:0%
reason why is that
 
00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
under um the the enhanced payment rates
 
00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
and under directed payments those can
 
00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:38.480 align:start position:0%
only go to Medicaid New Hampshire
 
00:37:41.069 --> 00:37:41.079 align:start position:0%
residents Associated
 
00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
Services um it it can't go for anything
 
00:37:48.790 --> 00:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
else the the the dish dollars can go to
 
00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:51.960 align:start position:0%
cover uncompensated care like a hospital
 
00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
that sees like a Dartmouth Hitchcock who
 
00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
sees a lot of patients from Vermont um
 
00:38:00.430 --> 00:38:00.440 align:start position:0%
that that's where the the uncompensated
 
00:38:01.790 --> 00:38:01.800 align:start position:0%
care dollars are important to the
 
00:38:04.109 --> 00:38:04.119 align:start position:0%
hospitals in terms of being able to
 
00:38:07.790 --> 00:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
develop a formula that addresses um the
 
00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
distribution of this pool um and uh so I
 
00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:15.680 align:start position:0%
think the the issue right now today is
 
00:38:18.349 --> 00:38:18.359 align:start position:0%
we're not sure um if this is going to be
 
00:38:21.109 --> 00:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
extended I'm sure there's great um
 
00:38:25.829 --> 00:38:25.839 align:start position:0%
lobbying efforts to extend it um but uh
 
00:38:28.750 --> 00:38:28.760 align:start position:0%
it is kind of tied to to okay the
 
00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:30.800 align:start position:0%
government shut down kind of situation
 
00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
does it does it get deferred more till
 
00:38:35.589 --> 00:38:35.599 align:start position:0%
you know the budget reconciliation
 
00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:38.240 align:start position:0%
process or do they um they take the
 
00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:41.240 align:start position:0%
savings now um don't have a clear answer
 
00:38:43.309 --> 00:38:43.319 align:start position:0%
on that I don't think anybody does uh
 
00:38:47.470 --> 00:38:47.480 align:start position:0%
but even even if um this weren't in play
 
00:38:49.870 --> 00:38:49.880 align:start position:0%
I think directionally the law is in
 
00:38:52.309 --> 00:38:52.319 align:start position:0%
place for It ultimately happen which is
 
00:38:55.589 --> 00:38:55.599 align:start position:0%
why you know starting in 2025 and really
 
00:38:56.790 --> 00:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
actually a little bit before that we
 
00:38:59.270 --> 00:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
started my ating using the Met dollars
 
00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:06.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:09.470 --> 00:39:09.480 align:start position:0%
sustainable um so um we're now on the
 
00:39:11.790 --> 00:39:11.800 align:start position:0%
presentation and if you want us to hold
 
00:39:13.109 --> 00:39:13.119 align:start position:0%
on this but this is where we were going
 
00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
to pick up the the separate handout of
 
00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:19.800 align:start position:0%
service changes and eligibility changes
 
00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:22.520 align:start position:0%
enacted and
 
00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:27.160 align:start position:0%
um there are 39 of these to to discuss
 
00:39:32.109 --> 00:39:32.119 align:start position:0%
with you um they're um the majority of
 
00:39:34.589 --> 00:39:34.599 align:start position:0%
them all but five are really either
 
00:39:38.309 --> 00:39:38.319 align:start position:0%
federally um driven or by our New
 
00:39:40.829 --> 00:39:40.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legislature driven um and
 
00:39:42.309 --> 00:39:42.319 align:start position:0%
there are a few exceptions to that and
 
00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:44.720 align:start position:0%
I'll cover those five
 
00:39:48.069 --> 00:39:48.079 align:start position:0%
exceptions um representative priest for
 
00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:51.240 align:start position:0%
a question uh thank you madam chairman
 
00:39:54.390 --> 00:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
as a point of clarification this
 
00:39:58.230 --> 00:39:58.240 align:start position:0%
represents what the impacts would be
 
00:39:58.240 --> 00:39:59.630 align:start position:0%
represents what the impacts would be
if

00:39:59.630 --> 00:39:59.640 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
Congress does nothing on the budget and
 
00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:07.880 align:start position:0%
it just falls down to 90% no this is
 
00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
this is really untethered from that
 
00:40:12.309 --> 00:40:12.319 align:start position:0%
whole discussion this I think um this
 
00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
was originally requested by the chair um
 
00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:18.200 align:start position:0%
to understand what policy changes have
 
00:40:22.069 --> 00:40:22.079 align:start position:0%
been made and and did did this committee
 
00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
want to consider any changes to those
 
00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
policy changes that were
 
00:40:28.349 --> 00:40:28.359 align:start position:0%
enacted okay thank you thank
 
00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:31.480 align:start position:0%
you representative Nano for a question
 
00:40:33.109 --> 00:40:33.119 align:start position:0%
yeah just for clarification purposes
 
00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:36.520 align:start position:0%
this really I I think if I recall recall
 
00:40:38.430 --> 00:40:38.440 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards question it was
 
00:40:40.990 --> 00:40:41.000 align:start position:0%
looking at the whole eligibility
 
00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:42.880 align:start position:0%
question and so this relates to changes
 
00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
in eligibility with the relative impacts
 
00:40:50.309 --> 00:40:50.319 align:start position:0%
services and eligibility um that that
 
00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:52.440 align:start position:0%
was what we got us the question from
 
00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:53.960 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards thank you that's
 
00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:55.640 align:start position:0%
what I understood the the question was
 
00:40:57.910 --> 00:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
and how I understood this uh
 
00:41:00.670 --> 00:41:00.680 align:start position:0%
thank thank you um representative
 
00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:02.720 align:start position:0%
Stringham for question it looks like
 
00:41:06.109 --> 00:41:06.119 align:start position:0%
you're also addressing rate changes
 
00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
which doesn't affect eligibility but
 
00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
impacts uh how much we pay
 
00:41:15.550 --> 00:41:15.560 align:start position:0%
basically cost cost of living largely
 
00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:18.520 align:start position:0%
cost of uh living increases but there
 
00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
were some that were um singled out um uh
 
00:41:28.270 --> 00:41:28.280 align:start position:0%
because there was um dramatic under
 
00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
service in those areas so um so you've
 
00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
included all of those is that right yes
 
00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
we we consider those to be service
 
00:41:38.829 --> 00:41:38.839 align:start position:0%
changes um and you know you could look
 
00:41:40.990 --> 00:41:41.000 align:start position:0%
at them differently but I think we
 
00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:43.160 align:start position:0%
wanted to be fully transparent as much
 
00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
as we could have all the things that
 
00:41:47.950 --> 00:41:47.960 align:start position:0%
have come up via legislative policy
 
00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
federal policy and a few things outside
 
00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:54.160 align:start position:0%
of that and the the last column
 
00:41:57.069 --> 00:41:57.079 align:start position:0%
estimated cost that's annual um those
 
00:42:00.069 --> 00:42:00.079 align:start position:0%
those those are uh tied to an annual uh
 
00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
this they're represented in total funds
 
00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
and then the breakdown where we have it
 
00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
uh below um there are a couple here that
 
00:42:11.950 --> 00:42:11.960 align:start position:0%
that uh we don't have a fund in them
 
00:42:13.470 --> 00:42:13.480 align:start position:0%
because there may not have actually been
 
00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
an increase in costs for example the
 
00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
very first one um uh women could get um
 
00:42:22.069 --> 00:42:22.079 align:start position:0%
12 12 months of oral contraceptives
 
00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:24.400 align:start position:0%
before I think this particular uh
 
00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
statutory change was to make it more
 
00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
convenient to be able to get that in one
 
00:42:31.829 --> 00:42:31.839 align:start position:0%
prescription as opposed to having to go
 
00:42:37.589 --> 00:42:37.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:40.720 align:start position:0%
year if you're so my thought is to go
 
00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
through them um just as a time check uh
 
00:42:46.910 --> 00:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
we're almost 45 minutes in which is hard
 
00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
to believe actually time flies here are
 
00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:53.400 align:start position:0%
you okay with that yes I think a lot of
 
00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
this can move fairly quickly depending
 
00:42:57.630 --> 00:42:57.640 align:start position:0%
on the level of
 
00:43:02.030 --> 00:43:02.040 align:start position:0%
right um and um this was uh is this is
 
00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
tremendously helpful and informative the
 
00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
way it's presented and the information
 
00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
contained so I think it would be good to
 
00:43:12.430 --> 00:43:12.440 align:start position:0%
have a um a rundown
 
00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
sure um the number and I put we've put
 
00:43:18.750 --> 00:43:18.760 align:start position:0%
numbers in the column first we were
 
00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
going over it last night saying we're g
 
00:43:22.549 --> 00:43:22.559 align:start position:0%
make it hard to follow if we don't have
 
00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
some way of directing you to the one
 
00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
we're talking about um so we're on
 
00:43:28.750 --> 00:43:28.760 align:start position:0%
number number two now the Medicaid
 
00:43:31.710 --> 00:43:31.720 align:start position:0%
assist medication assisted treatment um
 
00:43:35.109 --> 00:43:35.119 align:start position:0%
is a mandatory benefit that was um
 
00:43:40.510 --> 00:43:40.520 align:start position:0%
enacted by um Congress um and um so we
 
00:43:42.589 --> 00:43:42.599 align:start position:0%
really don't have a choice if we want to
 
00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
participate in the Medicaid Program and
 
00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
I don't think it was something that we
 
00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't think was a good thing which is
 
00:43:51.150 --> 00:43:51.160 align:start position:0%
to for people uh particularly older
 
00:43:53.910 --> 00:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
people who U might need medic medication
 
00:43:56.309 --> 00:43:56.319 align:start position:0%
assisted treatment um you know I think
 
00:43:58.030 --> 00:43:58.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes that's under reported and from
 
00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:01.240 align:start position:0%
what I understand in terms of the of
 
00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
that issue for particularly the elderly
 
00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
that uh may be um you know Home and
 
00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
Community Based as an example so it
 
00:44:10.950 --> 00:44:10.960 align:start position:0%
makes sure that that there's funding
 
00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
available to provide that service um
 
00:44:17.790 --> 00:44:17.800 align:start position:0%
then the the next one down were the
 
00:44:21.870 --> 00:44:21.880 align:start position:0%
provider um rate increases enacted in
 
00:44:24.750 --> 00:44:24.760 align:start position:0%
hb4 um the laws of
 
00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:28.240 align:start position:0%
2019 um on the far right here do have
 
00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
the um the total funding and then a
 
00:44:35.069 --> 00:44:35.079 align:start position:0%
breakdown between the um the general and
 
00:44:37.589 --> 00:44:37.599 align:start position:0%
federal funds and then the um accounting
 
00:44:41.630 --> 00:44:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:43.309 align:start position:0%
 
column

00:44:43.309 --> 00:44:43.319 align:start position:0%
column
 
00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:46.240 align:start position:0%
um any questions on
 
00:44:48.790 --> 00:44:48.800 align:start position:0%
okay representative priest for a
 
00:44:51.670 --> 00:44:51.680 align:start position:0%
question thank you Madame Vice chairman
 
00:44:54.430 --> 00:44:54.440 align:start position:0%
um again I think it would be very
 
00:44:56.510 --> 00:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
helpful it would be very helpful to me
 
00:44:59.950 --> 00:44:59.960 align:start position:0%
and maybe others on this committee if we
 
00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:04.720 align:start position:0%
could see the faces behind each of these
 
00:45:07.829 --> 00:45:07.839 align:start position:0%
programs and how many people you are
 
00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:12.040 align:start position:0%
serving as of this year we will have the
 
00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:14.960 align:start position:0%
statistics on this year um coming up in
 
00:45:20.670 --> 00:45:20.680 align:start position:0%
the presentation um and uh we if if you
 
00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
will after we do that if there's more
 
00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
information than that if there's more
 
00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
information you need or want beyond that
 
00:45:31.870 --> 00:45:31.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:34.160 align:start position:0%
follow representative Stringham for a
 
00:45:36.829 --> 00:45:36.839 align:start position:0%
question and 2020 provider rate increas
 
00:45:39.150 --> 00:45:39.160 align:start position:0%
is that just a flat percentage increase
 
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
across the board that year um no I think
 
00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:43.960 align:start position:0%
there were some targeted rate increases
 
00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
for particularly for um inpatient um
 
00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
mental health the drfs uh were um a very
 
00:45:53.069 --> 00:45:53.079 align:start position:0%
large increase I think we like tripled
 
00:45:55.750 --> 00:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
the rates for um to get more um
 
00:45:59.430 --> 00:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:02.349 --> 00:46:02.359 align:start position:0%
um we could if you want could put
 
00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
together a summary but that off the top
 
00:46:05.230 --> 00:46:05.240 align:start position:0%
of my head is I remember being one of
 
00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:09.240 align:start position:0%
the larger components of of it um and
 
00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:12.440 align:start position:0%
that's still included in here uh in this
 
00:46:14.829 --> 00:46:14.839 align:start position:0%
because those rate increases basically
 
00:46:17.589 --> 00:46:17.599 align:start position:0%
became permanent yes so that that was
 
00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:20.200 align:start position:0%
part of the base already when we were
 
00:46:22.549 --> 00:46:22.559 align:start position:0%
discussing provider rates two years ago
 
00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
yes thank
 
00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:28.720 align:start position:0%
you um the transitional housing I think
 
00:46:31.470 --> 00:46:31.480 align:start position:0%
um when trying to put a face to this one
 
00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
the type of population here would be um
 
00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of individuals who might be in the
 
00:46:38.750 --> 00:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
mental health or or substance use space
 
00:46:41.630 --> 00:46:41.640 align:start position:0%
who um particularly discharging from New
 
00:46:46.030 --> 00:46:46.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital or um or other um
 
00:46:48.109 --> 00:46:48.119 align:start position:0%
mental health settings that you know
 
00:46:50.430 --> 00:46:50.440 align:start position:0%
having a chance to have a place to to
 
00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
reestablish yourself before um moving on
 
00:46:56.910 --> 00:46:56.920 align:start position:0%
to a more permanent situation um in part
 
00:46:59.109 --> 00:46:59.119 align:start position:0%
you know the the backup into the
 
00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:02.200 align:start position:0%
emergency rooms um is because often
 
00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
times um former commissioner shanet who
 
00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
was at the time head of New Hampshire
 
00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
hospital would say that you know we have
 
00:47:11.549 --> 00:47:11.559 align:start position:0%
a back door problem we can treat people
 
00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:13.240 align:start position:0%
but there's no place to put them in the
 
00:47:15.069 --> 00:47:15.079 align:start position:0%
community you know even when they're no
 
00:47:17.710 --> 00:47:17.720 align:start position:0%
longer in acute status so I think this
 
00:47:21.829 --> 00:47:21.839 align:start position:0%
was an investment made to uh improve uh
 
00:47:24.589 --> 00:47:24.599 align:start position:0%
discharge um opportunities for people so
 
00:47:26.349 --> 00:47:26.359 align:start position:0%
they didn't have to remain um
 
00:47:26.359 --> 00:47:31.109 align:start position:0%
they didn't have to remain um
Institution

00:47:31.109 --> 00:47:31.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:34.230 --> 00:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
Iz and then um I guess there's a
 
00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
specific appropriation here for for drf
 
00:47:39.150 --> 00:47:39.160 align:start position:0%
beds um this may have been there was
 
00:47:42.349 --> 00:47:42.359 align:start position:0%
also a there were I think two components
 
00:47:44.589 --> 00:47:44.599 align:start position:0%
the appropriation one was to increase
 
00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
and one was the rate for those who are
 
00:47:49.390 --> 00:47:49.400 align:start position:0%
already existing and then to encourage
 
00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
new ones to come on board I believe that
 
00:47:55.549 --> 00:47:55.559 align:start position:0%
that's what this one was
 
00:48:00.990 --> 00:48:01.000 align:start position:0%
um um Supportive Housing um is again I
 
00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:04.520 align:start position:0%
think a another um attempt to build out
 
00:48:06.589 --> 00:48:06.599 align:start position:0%
the community- based resources for
 
00:48:10.190 --> 00:48:10.200 align:start position:0%
individuals who are U affected by mental
 
00:48:12.030 --> 00:48:12.040 align:start position:0%
health and substit use disorder
 
00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
conditions again this is a temporary uh
 
00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:19.640 align:start position:0%
funding to um enable someone to um have
 
00:48:22.030 --> 00:48:22.040 align:start position:0%
a place to live and not be on the street
 
00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
in terms of in a transition I think the
 
00:48:27.230 --> 00:48:27.240 align:start position:0%
you know some of the major invest ments
 
00:48:28.950 --> 00:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
that that have been made by the
 
00:48:30.829 --> 00:48:30.839 align:start position:0%
legislature is trying to you know
 
00:48:33.349 --> 00:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
improve the transition situation that
 
00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
that we find ourselves in so we don't
 
00:48:36.990 --> 00:48:37.000 align:start position:0%
have back up into the emergency room and
 
00:48:39.309 --> 00:48:39.319 align:start position:0%
building out community services so that
 
00:48:41.790 --> 00:48:41.800 align:start position:0%
people don't reenter institutions
 
00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
because there are Community Based
 
00:48:46.270 --> 00:48:46.280 align:start position:0%
Services available representative walner
 
00:48:47.870 --> 00:48:47.880 align:start position:0%
for a
 
00:48:51.309 --> 00:48:51.319 align:start position:0%
question um how are the how do people
 
00:48:54.589 --> 00:48:54.599 align:start position:0%
receive this help is it a voucher kind
 
00:48:57.870 --> 00:48:57.880 align:start position:0%
of program or do we actually have
 
00:48:57.880 --> 00:48:58.990 align:start position:0%
of program or do we actually have
places

00:48:58.990 --> 00:48:59.000 align:start position:0%
places
 
00:49:03.030 --> 00:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
that so live there's a there's a
 
00:49:05.950 --> 00:49:05.960 align:start position:0%
screening process that like a case
 
00:49:10.030 --> 00:49:10.040 align:start position:0%
management assessment of of it and then
 
00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:11.549 align:start position:0%
management assessment of of it and then
um

00:49:11.549 --> 00:49:11.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:14.470 --> 00:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
there's uh support I'm not an expert on
 
00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:17.160 align:start position:0%
this program but um basically there's uh
 
00:49:20.750 --> 00:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
support to um help them get into a
 
00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
housing situation you know some people
 
00:49:26.349 --> 00:49:26.359 align:start position:0%
may need help with things like basic
 
00:49:28.589 --> 00:49:28.599 align:start position:0%
household budgeting you know being able
 
00:49:32.670 --> 00:49:32.680 align:start position:0%
to you know um be a good tenant um and
 
00:49:34.789 --> 00:49:34.799 align:start position:0%
it's the basically the types of services
 
00:49:38.270 --> 00:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
that would allow someone who may have
 
00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:40.640 align:start position:0%
some challenges transitioning to a
 
00:49:42.430 --> 00:49:42.440 align:start position:0%
independent living situation to have the
 
00:49:46.670 --> 00:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
supports to to to do that transition
 
00:49:49.270 --> 00:49:49.280 align:start position:0%
successfully representative nello for a
 
00:49:51.230 --> 00:49:51.240 align:start position:0%
question followed by representative
 
00:49:54.030 --> 00:49:54.040 align:start position:0%
priest yes thank you uh uh Madam
 
00:49:56.910 --> 00:49:56.920 align:start position:0%
co-chair um so my understanding is the
 
00:49:58.630 --> 00:49:58.640 align:start position:0%
difference between number four and
 
00:50:01.750 --> 00:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
number six is really a length of time
 
00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
issue or they look like they overlap so
 
00:50:07.430 --> 00:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
they probably do overlap in the sense of
 
00:50:10.069 --> 00:50:10.079 align:start position:0%
one is creating the the housing
 
00:50:12.150 --> 00:50:12.160 align:start position:0%
opportunities and the other is sort of
 
00:50:14.870 --> 00:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
the case management Care Management and
 
00:50:18.349 --> 00:50:18.359 align:start position:0%
support so that um that they can
 
00:50:20.789 --> 00:50:20.799 align:start position:0%
successfully be in a setting you know in
 
00:50:24.630 --> 00:50:24.640 align:start position:0%
terms of you know landlord relations and
 
00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:26.240 align:start position:0%
and you know household budgeting and
 
00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:27.200 align:start position:0%
such that
 
00:50:29.349 --> 00:50:29.359 align:start position:0%
okay you have a place to go but let's
 
00:50:32.950 --> 00:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
make sure that you can
 
00:50:36.190 --> 00:50:36.200 align:start position:0%
um so is it correct to you know I'm just
 
00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh looking at is it correct to say that
 
00:50:40.309 --> 00:50:40.319 align:start position:0%
uh some portion of the people in
 
00:50:42.870 --> 00:50:42.880 align:start position:0%
transitional housing then uh take
 
00:50:44.829 --> 00:50:44.839 align:start position:0%
advantage of Supportive
 
00:50:48.069 --> 00:50:48.079 align:start position:0%
Housing it's it's possible but I to be
 
00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
to be fair to you um there are other
 
00:50:51.710 --> 00:50:51.720 align:start position:0%
people that have a lot more expertise on
 
00:50:54.430 --> 00:50:54.440 align:start position:0%
this program than I do um and probably
 
00:50:58.950 --> 00:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
uh would be in the um in Kota Fox's area
 
00:51:02.670 --> 00:51:02.680 align:start position:0%
that would be able to talk more um
 
00:51:07.309 --> 00:51:07.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
you um thank you madam chairman uh drf
 
00:51:16.710 --> 00:51:16.720 align:start position:0%
can you just yes Define that for me the
 
00:51:18.829 --> 00:51:18.839 align:start position:0%
the acronym stands for designated
 
00:51:22.069 --> 00:51:22.079 align:start position:0%
receiving facilities they're uh
 
00:51:24.990 --> 00:51:25.000 align:start position:0%
typically the high intensity mental
 
00:51:28.309 --> 00:51:28.319 align:start position:0%
health sometimes um um it's someone you
 
00:51:30.990 --> 00:51:31.000 align:start position:0%
hear the term committed um may be an
 
00:51:34.950 --> 00:51:34.960 align:start position:0%
involuntary basis um and sometimes
 
00:51:36.630 --> 00:51:36.640 align:start position:0%
people can go between involuntary and
 
00:51:38.069 --> 00:51:38.079 align:start position:0%
voluntary or Sometimes They Come
 
00:51:40.230 --> 00:51:40.240 align:start position:0%
involuntary in but it's more the more
 
00:51:42.109 --> 00:51:42.119 align:start position:0%
intense cases that typically are you
 
00:51:46.230 --> 00:51:46.240 align:start position:0%
know locked unit um okay and how many
 
00:51:49.270 --> 00:51:49.280 align:start position:0%
beds are in each of these categories and
 
00:51:52.870 --> 00:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
where are they located at um we'll take
 
00:51:54.670 --> 00:51:54.680 align:start position:0%
that back as a question um that would be
 
00:51:57.109 --> 00:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
great I just curious they're all
 
00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
concentrated in uh Manchester you know
 
00:52:05.910 --> 00:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
NASA and Rochester areas of the state so
 
00:52:09.910 --> 00:52:09.920 align:start position:0%
on the drf beds um the most recent
 
00:52:12.870 --> 00:52:12.880 align:start position:0%
addition um was Dartmouth Hitchcock um
 
00:52:14.789 --> 00:52:14.799 align:start position:0%
adding some beds there that that's
 
00:52:17.069 --> 00:52:17.079 align:start position:0%
probably the furthest North but like
 
00:52:20.589 --> 00:52:20.599 align:start position:0%
Franklin um hospital and Franklin is has
 
00:52:23.950 --> 00:52:23.960 align:start position:0%
drf but Manchester SE Coast the thing
 
00:52:25.750 --> 00:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
about it's not just having the beds it's
 
00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:27.069 align:start position:0%
about it's not just having the beds it's
having

00:52:27.069 --> 00:52:27.079 align:start position:0%
having
 
00:52:29.589 --> 00:52:29.599 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist all the trained nurses and
 
00:52:32.950 --> 00:52:32.960 align:start position:0%
such to go with it um but I know that
 
00:52:34.710 --> 00:52:34.720 align:start position:0%
other hospitals have looked at this
 
00:52:36.870 --> 00:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
issue and try to evaluate it but you
 
00:52:39.270 --> 00:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
know there is a shortage of U mental
 
00:52:40.950 --> 00:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
health professionals that the state is
 
00:52:42.150 --> 00:52:42.160 align:start position:0%
dealing with as
 
00:52:47.950 --> 00:52:47.960 align:start position:0%
well thank you sure um number seven is
 
00:52:52.069 --> 00:52:52.079 align:start position:0%
the children's system of care um and
 
00:52:54.109 --> 00:52:54.119 align:start position:0%
again uh the children's Behavioral
 
00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
Health people could tell you more about
 
00:52:57.030 --> 00:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
this but
 
00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
um in in 2019 um excuse me 2020 um think
 
00:53:04.910 --> 00:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
building the system of care out more for
 
00:53:08.549 --> 00:53:08.559 align:start position:0%
children that uh was I think probably
 
00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:10.720 align:start position:0%
kacha Fox may have addressed with you
 
00:53:12.349 --> 00:53:12.359 align:start position:0%
this is what this was the additional
 
00:53:14.309 --> 00:53:14.319 align:start position:0%
investment made by the legislature to
 
00:53:16.990 --> 00:53:17.000 align:start position:0%
help build out that system of supports
 
00:53:18.990 --> 00:53:19.000 align:start position:0%
basically a lot of it being mental
 
00:53:22.349 --> 00:53:22.359 align:start position:0%
health um for for children in terms of
 
00:53:28.150 --> 00:53:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:33.150 --> 00:53:33.160 align:start position:0%
um number eight um the is an action by
 
00:53:36.030 --> 00:53:36.040 align:start position:0%
Congress to make sure that um
 
00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
individuals in Medicaid have a chance to
 
00:53:42.789 --> 00:53:42.799 align:start position:0%
participate in clinical trials um New
 
00:53:46.349 --> 00:53:46.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I don't think this meant
 
00:53:50.510 --> 00:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
much to us because we had um you know
 
00:53:52.829 --> 00:53:52.839 align:start position:0%
the ability to um have people
 
00:53:54.750 --> 00:53:54.760 align:start position:0%
participate in clinical trials that were
 
00:53:57.670 --> 00:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate um but uh this sort of
 
00:54:00.109 --> 00:54:00.119 align:start position:0%
codified that you know it wasn't just
 
00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
that it was a good thing to do but that
 
00:54:03.510 --> 00:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
it needed to be done when it was
 
00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:05.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate to give people access to
 
00:54:09.750 --> 00:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
clinical trials um I know there's a bill
 
00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
in this session somewhere about
 
00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:14.030 align:start position:0%
in this session somewhere about
expanding

00:54:14.030 --> 00:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
expanding
 
00:54:17.589 --> 00:54:17.599 align:start position:0%
um choices I think it's a um a bill in
 
00:54:20.069 --> 00:54:20.079 align:start position:0%
Commerce about choices but in terms of
 
00:54:22.309 --> 00:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
the Medicade program the access to
 
00:54:24.750 --> 00:54:24.760 align:start position:0%
clinical trials is really not an issue
 
00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:28.310 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:28.310 --> 00:54:29.510 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:54:33.109 --> 00:54:33.119 align:start position:0%
um number nine is the adult Dental
 
00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
benefit um that was enacted in
 
00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
22 um and um you know implemented in
 
00:54:42.829 --> 00:54:42.839 align:start position:0%
April of
 
00:54:42.839 --> 00:54:44.990 align:start position:0%
April of
23

00:54:44.990 --> 00:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
23
 
00:54:47.270 --> 00:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
um they
 
00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:49.270 align:start position:0%
um they
um

00:54:49.270 --> 00:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
um I think uh the if you may recall the
 
00:54:57.190 --> 00:54:57.200 align:start position:0%
the Dentures um uh was something that
 
00:54:59.430 --> 00:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
the legislature wanted to provide to
 
00:55:03.109 --> 00:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
people in waivers and in um nursing
 
00:55:05.950 --> 00:55:05.960 align:start position:0%
homes um but not necessarily the the
 
00:55:09.030 --> 00:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
public at large um and that are in the
 
00:55:13.430 --> 00:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
program and so um we had to uh do a
 
00:55:16.390 --> 00:55:16.400 align:start position:0%
special um state plan amendment to enact
 
00:55:19.710 --> 00:55:19.720 align:start position:0%
that and then also there was an interest
 
00:55:24.789 --> 00:55:24.799 align:start position:0%
in um certain populations um to uh to
 
00:55:27.870 --> 00:55:27.880 align:start position:0%
have uh CAU sharing for dental
 
00:55:41.710 --> 00:55:41.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:48.069 align:start position:0%
 
about

00:55:48.069 --> 00:55:48.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:51.200 align:start position:0%
see trying to remember number 11 here
 
00:55:52.630 --> 00:55:52.640 align:start position:0%
I'm going to have to having a little
 
00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
brain cramp on what that that one was
 
00:55:58.750 --> 00:55:58.760 align:start position:0%
but um I think it was and um probably um
 
00:56:02.309 --> 00:56:02.319 align:start position:0%
expanding the the
 
00:56:06.069 --> 00:56:06.079 align:start position:0%
um the use of
 
00:56:09.750 --> 00:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh uh caregivers in in um you know in a
 
00:56:12.710 --> 00:56:12.720 align:start position:0%
waiver situation but I'll let me have
 
00:56:15.270 --> 00:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
someone verify that for
 
00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:19.470 align:start position:0%
someone verify that for
me

00:56:19.470 --> 00:56:19.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:23.750 --> 00:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
um then number 12 is uh birthing
 
00:56:28.870 --> 00:56:28.880 align:start position:0%
Services um and this was to um increase
 
00:56:31.549 --> 00:56:31.559 align:start position:0%
because of the closure of
 
00:56:41.230 --> 00:56:41.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:44.910 --> 00:56:44.920 align:start position:0%
we yeah so so I guess going back to
 
00:56:48.589 --> 00:56:48.599 align:start position:0%
number to 11 um thank you Nathan for
 
00:56:50.470 --> 00:56:50.480 align:start position:0%
helping me remember that one is you know
 
00:56:53.750 --> 00:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
there was a significant shortage of Home
 
00:56:57.470 --> 00:56:57.480 align:start position:0%
Care um available for personal care and
 
00:56:59.630 --> 00:56:59.640 align:start position:0%
it um I think that gave us the authority
 
00:57:02.109 --> 00:57:02.119 align:start position:0%
to be able to provide um some
 
00:57:04.109 --> 00:57:04.119 align:start position:0%
compensation to family members under
 
00:57:07.670 --> 00:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
certain um controls to be able to
 
00:57:09.950 --> 00:57:09.960 align:start position:0%
support individuals that in their home
 
00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
there were you know times when um you
 
00:57:16.349 --> 00:57:16.359 align:start position:0%
know the during particularly during the
 
00:57:18.870 --> 00:57:18.880 align:start position:0%
the closures that was very difficult to
 
00:57:21.309 --> 00:57:21.319 align:start position:0%
get Staffing to keep maintain people in
 
00:57:23.029 --> 00:57:23.039 align:start position:0%
their homes and this gave us some
 
00:57:28.069 --> 00:57:28.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:32.430 --> 00:57:32.440 align:start position:0%
um and and number 13 is also there were
 
00:57:35.630 --> 00:57:35.640 align:start position:0%
certain um rules that were available to
 
00:57:38.190 --> 00:57:38.200 align:start position:0%
us to provide personal care services in
 
00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
the home um and when the federal Public
 
00:57:44.910 --> 00:57:44.920 align:start position:0%
Health Emergency ended um there were
 
00:57:46.910 --> 00:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
greater restrictions but still an
 
00:57:50.589 --> 00:57:50.599 align:start position:0%
allowance and so what 13 um represents
 
00:57:55.150 --> 00:57:55.160 align:start position:0%
is okay now that the the flexibilities
 
00:57:57.109 --> 00:57:57.119 align:start position:0%
that were available during the public
 
00:58:00.150 --> 00:58:00.160 align:start position:0%
health emergency or over we still had a
 
00:58:02.829 --> 00:58:02.839 align:start position:0%
a Workforce shortage in the state and um
 
00:58:05.789 --> 00:58:05.799 align:start position:0%
this was um a waiver that we were able
 
00:58:10.470 --> 00:58:10.480 align:start position:0%
to uh obtain to continue to allow um a
 
00:58:13.710 --> 00:58:13.720 align:start position:0%
certain level of of family based support
 
00:58:16.270 --> 00:58:16.280 align:start position:0%
um and I will say this is it isn't just
 
00:58:18.390 --> 00:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
sort of a free-for-all kind of thing
 
00:58:20.270 --> 00:58:20.280 align:start position:0%
that they build the state they have to
 
00:58:23.870 --> 00:58:23.880 align:start position:0%
we set up a a relationship with uh uh
 
00:58:25.870 --> 00:58:25.880 align:start position:0%
Grand State Independent Living who make
 
00:58:27.589 --> 00:58:27.599 align:start position:0%
sure sure that they're oriented and that
 
00:58:31.190 --> 00:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
the hours attract and that that it's
 
00:58:32.829 --> 00:58:32.839 align:start position:0%
based on something that has controls
 
00:58:34.230 --> 00:58:34.240 align:start position:0%
around it's not a wide open thing that
 
00:58:37.630 --> 00:58:37.640 align:start position:0%
you could just build the um but it's it
 
00:58:40.390 --> 00:58:40.400 align:start position:0%
fills an important need where um home
 
00:58:43.910 --> 00:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
care workers particularly um some of
 
00:58:47.150 --> 00:58:47.160 align:start position:0%
our U families that have a severely
 
00:58:49.710 --> 00:58:49.720 align:start position:0%
disabled child at home a case that you
 
00:58:51.190 --> 00:58:51.200 align:start position:0%
know they may be on a ventilator and
 
00:58:53.470 --> 00:58:53.480 align:start position:0%
they need or or have a tra and they may
 
00:58:55.710 --> 00:58:55.720 align:start position:0%
need someone to help them come into the
 
00:58:57.910 --> 00:58:57.920 align:start position:0%
home to be able to they want to keep the
 
00:58:59.150 --> 00:58:59.160 align:start position:0%
child at home but they need some
 
00:59:02.190 --> 00:59:02.200 align:start position:0%
supports to to do so and and we know
 
00:59:04.309 --> 00:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
that typically it's two to three times
 
00:59:05.950 --> 00:59:05.960 align:start position:0%
more expensive to institutionalize
 
00:59:08.390 --> 00:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
versus maintaining at the home and then
 
00:59:11.109 --> 00:59:11.119 align:start position:0%
also the the value of M keeping a family
 
00:59:13.549 --> 00:59:13.559 align:start position:0%
together I think is is reflected there
 
00:59:15.349 --> 00:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
representative Nano for a question
 
00:59:17.870 --> 00:59:17.880 align:start position:0%
followed by representative pre thank you
 
00:59:20.870 --> 00:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
madam chair uh so Mr liman so how do I
 
00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
interpret the blank boxes under the
 
00:59:27.150 --> 00:59:27.160 align:start position:0%
estimated cost uh so in that when we
 
00:59:29.549 --> 00:59:29.559 align:start position:0%
were providing the service already and
 
00:59:32.470 --> 00:59:32.480 align:start position:0%
so this was just it actually may be a
 
00:59:35.470 --> 00:59:35.480 align:start position:0%
lesser cost in terms of um the personal
 
00:59:35.480 --> 00:59:36.270 align:start position:0%
lesser cost in terms of um the personal
care

00:59:36.270 --> 00:59:36.280 align:start position:0%
care
 
00:59:39.230 --> 00:59:39.240 align:start position:0%
services so so a DI Minimus incremental
 
00:59:41.069 --> 00:59:41.079 align:start position:0%
cost off of what we're already doing is
 
00:59:42.910 --> 00:59:42.920 align:start position:0%
that how I interpret that on this
 
00:59:45.549 --> 00:59:45.559 align:start position:0%
particular one I think it's probably a a
 
00:59:48.069 --> 00:59:48.079 align:start position:0%
reduction as opposed to an increase um
 
00:59:51.549 --> 00:59:51.559 align:start position:0%
because the the criteria to be able to
 
00:59:55.109 --> 00:59:55.119 align:start position:0%
do it were tightened a little bit and um
 
00:59:56.710 --> 00:59:56.720 align:start position:0%
so that that's that's why I don't think
 
00:59:59.670 --> 00:59:59.680 align:start position:0%
it really if it's di Minimus it's it's
 
01:00:01.390 --> 01:00:01.400 align:start position:0%
di Minimus moving in the direction of
 
01:00:05.549 --> 01:00:05.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
you thank you madam Vice chairman and my
 
01:00:12.309 --> 01:00:12.319 align:start position:0%
question is along with my fellow
 
01:00:15.549 --> 01:00:15.559 align:start position:0%
representative um I I get the feeling
 
01:00:18.549 --> 01:00:18.559 align:start position:0%
that these blank spaces on the estimated
 
01:00:20.710 --> 01:00:20.720 align:start position:0%
cost are the ones are not being funded
 
01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
they have no funds they're on the books
 
01:00:26.829 --> 01:00:26.839 align:start position:0%
and that's the way it is is that correct
 
01:00:31.309 --> 01:00:31.319 align:start position:0%
um no that I would say that um in the in
 
01:00:33.950 --> 01:00:33.960 align:start position:0%
um what I'll try to do is go back as I
 
01:00:36.390 --> 01:00:36.400 align:start position:0%
go forward is address the blank spots
 
01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:41.029 align:start position:0%
go forward is address the blank spots
for

01:00:41.029 --> 01:00:41.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:44.950 --> 01:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
you sure um so I think Nathan was
 
01:00:48.390 --> 01:00:48.400 align:start position:0%
suggesting if if something is in our
 
01:00:51.710 --> 01:00:51.720 align:start position:0%
state plan it's already built into our
 
01:00:54.349 --> 01:00:54.359 align:start position:0%
budget and sometimes it's you know a
 
01:00:55.710 --> 01:00:55.720 align:start position:0%
modification of something that we're
 
01:00:59.150 --> 01:00:59.160 align:start position:0%
already doing like for example the medic
 
01:01:01.109 --> 01:01:01.119 align:start position:0%
medication assist treatment you know
 
01:01:03.470 --> 01:01:03.480 align:start position:0%
we're already doing it and we're
 
01:01:05.990 --> 01:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
just New Hampshire was Progressive in
 
01:01:08.910 --> 01:01:08.920 align:start position:0%
terms of its treatment as an example and
 
01:01:10.589 --> 01:01:10.599 align:start position:0%
so when they put in that Federal
 
01:01:12.750 --> 01:01:12.760 align:start position:0%
requirement it didn't really change what
 
01:01:15.950 --> 01:01:15.960 align:start position:0%
we expected to provide and services but
 
01:01:18.069 --> 01:01:18.079 align:start position:0%
if we're already doing shouldn't there
 
01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:21.720 align:start position:0%
be a cost to that well I think what we
 
01:01:23.789 --> 01:01:23.799 align:start position:0%
when when we do a state plan Amendment
 
01:01:26.430 --> 01:01:26.440 align:start position:0%
um if there's an additional cost cost
 
01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:28.440 align:start position:0%
it's here if it's if we believe it's
 
01:01:30.789 --> 01:01:30.799 align:start position:0%
already built into our base we don't we
 
01:01:34.549 --> 01:01:34.559 align:start position:0%
didn't include it okay thank you so
 
01:01:36.309 --> 01:01:36.319 align:start position:0%
we're coming up to another example that
 
01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:39.720 align:start position:0%
nicotine cessation counseling is um I
 
01:01:44.270 --> 01:01:44.280 align:start position:0%
think this allowed um pharmacists to be
 
01:01:46.829 --> 01:01:46.839 align:start position:0%
able to to be able to provide some of
 
01:01:51.829 --> 01:01:51.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:58.150 --> 01:01:58.160 align:start position:0%
um number 15 um 16 17 were part of the
 
01:02:03.269 --> 01:02:03.279 align:start position:0%
mnib legislation that was passed um in
 
01:02:08.470 --> 01:02:08.480 align:start position:0%
2023 um these do have um increased costs
 
01:02:11.870 --> 01:02:11.880 align:start position:0%
and which are noted um uh on the far
 
01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:13.630 align:start position:0%
and which are noted um uh on the far
right

01:02:13.630 --> 01:02:13.640 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:02:16.269 --> 01:02:16.279 align:start position:0%
column um lactation Services was
 
01:02:18.549 --> 01:02:18.559 align:start position:0%
basically we already provide lactation
 
01:02:21.390 --> 01:02:21.400 align:start position:0%
services but this was allowing um
 
01:02:23.309 --> 01:02:23.319 align:start position:0%
additional settings for which that to
 
01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
occur and additional um
 
01:02:28.710 --> 01:02:28.720 align:start position:0%
qualified individuals to to be able to
 
01:02:30.750 --> 01:02:30.760 align:start position:0%
provide that
 
01:02:35.710 --> 01:02:35.720 align:start position:0%
service um the the duo service
 
01:02:41.269 --> 01:02:41.279 align:start position:0%
um was passed into law there was um it
 
01:02:44.950 --> 01:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
got Consolidated into hb2 there was a
 
01:02:46.750 --> 01:02:46.760 align:start position:0%
component of rule making that was
 
01:02:49.870 --> 01:02:49.880 align:start position:0%
unfortunately left out of the the um
 
01:02:52.549 --> 01:02:52.559 align:start position:0%
when that happened so we had to go back
 
01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
and get um working with off office of
 
01:02:58.510 --> 01:02:58.520 align:start position:0%
professional licens your oplc is
 
01:03:01.710 --> 01:03:01.720 align:start position:0%
actually under their jurisdiction to um
 
01:03:03.549 --> 01:03:03.559 align:start position:0%
to get that rule making Authority that
 
01:03:06.269 --> 01:03:06.279 align:start position:0%
rulle making Authority is is is going
 
01:03:09.349 --> 01:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
through there you may recall Senator
 
01:03:12.029 --> 01:03:12.039 align:start position:0%
Whitley in in terms of this particular
 
01:03:13.670 --> 01:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
issue wanted to make sure there was good
 
01:03:16.349 --> 01:03:16.359 align:start position:0%
stakeholder engagement in developing
 
01:03:20.230 --> 01:03:20.240 align:start position:0%
this service and um we're hoping that uh
 
01:03:21.910 --> 01:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
um you know we're we're in the process
 
01:03:24.789 --> 01:03:24.799 align:start position:0%
of of uh getting ready to put this into
 
01:03:27.430 --> 01:03:27.440 align:start position:0%
place I think this is is a service that
 
01:03:30.109 --> 01:03:30.119 align:start position:0%
um does have a cost with it in the short
 
01:03:33.870 --> 01:03:33.880 align:start position:0%
run but in the longer term um I think it
 
01:03:35.349 --> 01:03:35.359 align:start position:0%
actually potentially could be a cost
 
01:03:38.829 --> 01:03:38.839 align:start position:0%
savings to the department um and similar
 
01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
to like Dental you know we know that
 
01:03:43.910 --> 01:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
there'll be emergency room savings but
 
01:03:45.910 --> 01:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
when we you know try to be conservative
 
01:03:47.589 --> 01:03:47.599 align:start position:0%
about how we put together projections we
 
01:03:49.789 --> 01:03:49.799 align:start position:0%
talked about that there would be you
 
01:03:51.630 --> 01:03:51.640 align:start position:0%
know potential savings by you know
 
01:03:52.789 --> 01:03:52.799 align:start position:0%
supporting making sure people are
 
01:03:54.390 --> 01:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
getting their free natal care making
 
01:03:55.750 --> 01:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
sure they're getting their appointments
 
01:03:56.510 --> 01:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
making sure they're getting their
 
01:03:58.390 --> 01:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
followup care all things that I think
 
01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
are good to good maternal Health um and
 
01:04:04.589 --> 01:04:04.599 align:start position:0%
um you know they're when you look at
 
01:04:07.230 --> 01:04:07.240 align:start position:0%
this service it's a you know Arkansas
 
01:04:10.630 --> 01:04:10.640 align:start position:0%
for example um is one of two states that
 
01:04:14.510 --> 01:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
have not yet adopted the the um Extended
 
01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
postpartum coverage but they have
 
01:04:18.190 --> 01:04:18.200 align:start position:0%
legislation going forward this session
 
01:04:20.589 --> 01:04:20.599 align:start position:0%
um to not only do the 12 months of
 
01:04:22.630 --> 01:04:22.640 align:start position:0%
continuous coverage but to also to on a
 
01:04:25.750 --> 01:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
presumptive basis provide dual coverage
 
01:04:27.829 --> 01:04:27.839 align:start position:0%
association with it I think there's you
 
01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:30.640 align:start position:0%
know um you know there sometimes a
 
01:04:32.470 --> 01:04:32.480 align:start position:0%
perception that this is a luxury service
 
01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's really not for for individuals
 
01:04:36.829 --> 01:04:36.839 align:start position:0%
who I think would take advantage of it
 
01:04:41.470 --> 01:04:41.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:44.349 --> 01:04:44.359 align:start position:0%
Program representative Nano has a
 
01:04:47.309 --> 01:04:47.319 align:start position:0%
question well maybe a comment I I was
 
01:04:48.589 --> 01:04:48.599 align:start position:0%
gonna ask the question I think you
 
01:04:51.750 --> 01:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
answered that that the duala uh program
 
01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
would have offsets uh elsewhere like
 
01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:56.190 align:start position:0%
would have offsets uh elsewhere like
those

01:04:56.190 --> 01:04:56.200 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:04:58.510 --> 01:04:58.520 align:start position:0%
not yet accounted for I guess given the
 
01:05:00.589 --> 01:05:00.599 align:start position:0%
lack of experience with that program
 
01:05:03.230 --> 01:05:03.240 align:start position:0%
that means that you have somebody who's
 
01:05:04.829 --> 01:05:04.839 align:start position:0%
that that service is probably a lot
 
01:05:06.269 --> 01:05:06.279 align:start position:0%
cheaper than somebody being in a
 
01:05:09.390 --> 01:05:09.400 align:start position:0%
hospital to make a
 
01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
delivery yeah I mean if when you look at
 
01:05:15.029 --> 01:05:15.039 align:start position:0%
complications at Birth and you know um
 
01:05:19.069 --> 01:05:19.079 align:start position:0%
that can happen and um that um you know
 
01:05:20.789 --> 01:05:20.799 align:start position:0%
the postpartum coverage and making sure
 
01:05:22.309 --> 01:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
that people are getting the services
 
01:05:25.109 --> 01:05:25.119 align:start position:0%
that they need so that you know you
 
01:05:26.470 --> 01:05:26.480 align:start position:0%
don't have
 
01:05:28.990 --> 01:05:29.000 align:start position:0%
bad events happen I think there there is
 
01:05:31.630 --> 01:05:31.640 align:start position:0%
a savings there but hard hard to
 
01:05:33.990 --> 01:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
quantify it will happen over time and
 
01:05:35.470 --> 01:05:35.480 align:start position:0%
and a lot of what I think the
 
01:05:37.510 --> 01:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
legislature has
 
01:05:39.990 --> 01:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
passed in terms of like building out the
 
01:05:42.549 --> 01:05:42.559 align:start position:0%
children's system of care adding you
 
01:05:45.109 --> 01:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
know resources in certain places is you
 
01:05:46.549 --> 01:05:46.559 align:start position:0%
know when someone stays in an emergency
 
01:05:48.430 --> 01:05:48.440 align:start position:0%
room as an example that's a very
 
01:05:50.990 --> 01:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
expensive place to stay if you if we can
 
01:05:52.549 --> 01:05:52.559 align:start position:0%
move people into a community based
 
01:05:55.870 --> 01:05:55.880 align:start position:0%
service and keep them there the cost to
 
01:05:58.589 --> 01:05:58.599 align:start position:0%
DHHS and the public at large is
 
01:06:00.789 --> 01:06:00.799 align:start position:0%
typically Less in terms of in many
 
01:06:02.230 --> 01:06:02.240 align:start position:0%
different areas whether it's the courts
 
01:06:05.190 --> 01:06:05.200 align:start position:0%
or the police or um you know excessive
 
01:06:09.109 --> 01:06:09.119 align:start position:0%
use of services um so that that I think
 
01:06:12.589 --> 01:06:12.599 align:start position:0%
is um I don't think there's a lot that
 
01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
you'll see when we go through this that
 
01:06:17.910 --> 01:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
that I think um would make sense if
 
01:06:19.870 --> 01:06:19.880 align:start position:0%
you're trying to manage long-term cost
 
01:06:22.430 --> 01:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
to to to go back on like you know
 
01:06:24.470 --> 01:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
postpartum care I think is really
 
01:06:25.990 --> 01:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
important and when you look at at some
 
01:06:28.390 --> 01:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
of the um you know the national
 
01:06:31.470 --> 01:06:31.480 align:start position:0%
statistics on these issues U that you
 
01:06:35.510 --> 01:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
know trying to to avoid um mortality and
 
01:06:38.069 --> 01:06:38.079 align:start position:0%
to and other issues I think there there
 
01:06:40.150 --> 01:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
are a lot of good things that you know
 
01:06:42.390 --> 01:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
we've been fortunate to be able to to do
 
01:06:43.870 --> 01:06:43.880 align:start position:0%
I understand with the budget in front of
 
01:06:46.990 --> 01:06:47.000 align:start position:0%
us there there a period of what we will
 
01:06:49.230 --> 01:06:49.240 align:start position:0%
try to make what we implemented work
 
01:06:51.230 --> 01:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
better I think is is is really what I
 
01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:53.029 align:start position:0%
better I think is is is really what I
would

01:06:53.029 --> 01:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:06:55.269 --> 01:06:55.279 align:start position:0%
encourage um yeah so I would just say
 
01:06:57.150 --> 01:06:57.160 align:start position:0%
that that the other piece of this is a
 
01:06:59.309 --> 01:06:59.319 align:start position:0%
risk assessment on the part of
 
01:07:02.269 --> 01:07:02.279 align:start position:0%
individual users on the
 
01:07:06.589 --> 01:07:06.599 align:start position:0%
service okay thank you um uh donor
 
01:07:10.349 --> 01:07:10.359 align:start position:0%
breast milk is um this is not people
 
01:07:13.630 --> 01:07:13.640 align:start position:0%
giving milk to one one another it's it's
 
01:07:17.349 --> 01:07:17.359 align:start position:0%
going through a uh a specialized
 
01:07:20.269 --> 01:07:20.279 align:start position:0%
facility and it's typically there are
 
01:07:22.670 --> 01:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
utilization criteria where an infant has
 
01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
to meet certain um weight and other
 
01:07:29.069 --> 01:07:29.079 align:start position:0%
conditions to be able to get access to
 
01:07:33.029 --> 01:07:33.039 align:start position:0%
this uh and again it's you know making
 
01:07:35.349 --> 01:07:35.359 align:start position:0%
sure a child starts life in a healthy
 
01:07:37.829 --> 01:07:37.839 align:start position:0%
way and and you know when that doesn't
 
01:07:39.910 --> 01:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
happen we have long-term costs in the
 
01:07:43.549 --> 01:07:43.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:46.589 --> 01:07:46.599 align:start position:0%
place Madam chair quick quick question
 
01:07:48.670 --> 01:07:48.680 align:start position:0%
so that's through representative Neno
 
01:07:50.430 --> 01:07:50.440 align:start position:0%
for a question that's through an outside
 
01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
agency like LTI or U some other
 
01:07:57.069 --> 01:07:57.079 align:start position:0%
organization that so so there's a I
 
01:07:58.589 --> 01:07:58.599 align:start position:0%
believe there's a facility in
 
01:08:01.870 --> 01:08:01.880 align:start position:0%
Connecticut that U that Banks the milk
 
01:08:04.750 --> 01:08:04.760 align:start position:0%
and Dartmouth Hitchcock I believe is our
 
01:08:08.109 --> 01:08:08.119 align:start position:0%
is the one that actually distributes it
 
01:08:09.670 --> 01:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
uh and I'm not sure if there's another
 
01:08:11.470 --> 01:08:11.480 align:start position:0%
hospital that that is doing it today but
 
01:08:14.269 --> 01:08:14.279 align:start position:0%
I know Dartmouth was was one of them and
 
01:08:15.870 --> 01:08:15.880 align:start position:0%
obviously they see a lot of the more
 
01:08:17.870 --> 01:08:17.880 align:start position:0%
premies and things like that there right
 
01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:22.430 align:start position:0%
premies and things like that there right
thank

01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:26.590 --> 01:08:26.600 align:start position:0%
you mobile crisis is sort of the rapid
 
01:08:29.669 --> 01:08:29.679 align:start position:0%
response to um providing Mental Health
 
01:08:33.550 --> 01:08:33.560 align:start position:0%
Services in the community um here's an
 
01:08:35.070 --> 01:08:35.080 align:start position:0%
example of something that wasn't
 
01:08:37.269 --> 01:08:37.279 align:start position:0%
legislatively mandated but the
 
01:08:39.189 --> 01:08:39.199 align:start position:0%
department saw while we're doing this
 
01:08:43.669 --> 01:08:43.679 align:start position:0%
service um there's potential to get um
 
01:08:45.269 --> 01:08:45.279 align:start position:0%
because Congress passed something that
 
01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:47.759 align:start position:0%
provided an enhanced match you know the
 
01:08:50.189 --> 01:08:50.199 align:start position:0%
state had an interest in um building out
 
01:08:52.309 --> 01:08:52.319 align:start position:0%
mobile crisis so all communities in the
 
01:08:56.189 --> 01:08:56.199 align:start position:0%
state could be served uh when um
 
01:08:58.110 --> 01:08:58.120 align:start position:0%
a certain definition of services is
 
01:09:01.030 --> 01:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
provided the state instead of a 50%
 
01:09:04.590 --> 01:09:04.600 align:start position:0%
match um in those instances gets an 85%
 
01:09:07.430 --> 01:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
match um so it was something that seemed
 
01:09:10.709 --> 01:09:10.719 align:start position:0%
to be a prudent thing to to do since we
 
01:09:12.990 --> 01:09:13.000 align:start position:0%
were going to provide the service
 
01:09:15.870 --> 01:09:15.880 align:start position:0%
irrespective oron already were um so
 
01:09:17.550 --> 01:09:17.560 align:start position:0%
that was an instance of something that
 
01:09:20.630 --> 01:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
wasn't legislatively required of us but
 
01:09:23.829 --> 01:09:23.839 align:start position:0%
Congress made this opportunity and and
 
01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
um since we look to provide the service
 
01:09:32.510 --> 01:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
um that uh we we sought that uh state
 
01:09:36.149 --> 01:09:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:36.159 --> 01:09:37.910 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:44.440 align:start position:0%
um number uh 19 um let's see this this
 
01:09:48.030 --> 01:09:48.040 align:start position:0%
gets into um what were the hb2 rate
 
01:09:50.669 --> 01:09:50.679 align:start position:0%
increases I think we have all seen
 
01:09:54.269 --> 01:09:54.279 align:start position:0%
stories about the challenges that um the
 
01:09:57.870 --> 01:09:57.880 align:start position:0%
EMS Community is having um you know on
 
01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
the Sea Coast up north um you know labor
 
01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:03.960 align:start position:0%
shortages you know as certain Hospital
 
01:10:07.030 --> 01:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
services are closed like maternity um
 
01:10:10.630 --> 01:10:10.640 align:start position:0%
you know that ambulances in small towns
 
01:10:12.990 --> 01:10:13.000 align:start position:0%
have to go further away which sometimes
 
01:10:17.350 --> 01:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
leaves the towns uncovered um and so I
 
01:10:20.669 --> 01:10:20.679 align:start position:0%
think this was um trying to bring our
 
01:10:25.870 --> 01:10:25.880 align:start position:0%
rates to um Medicare levels um and
 
01:10:30.310 --> 01:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
um it was achieved in part of uh of hb2
 
01:10:33.070 --> 01:10:33.080 align:start position:0%
now price changes will happen thereafter
 
01:10:35.709 --> 01:10:35.719 align:start position:0%
there's um legislation that was enacted
 
01:10:39.470 --> 01:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
I think we come later on to um also
 
01:10:43.189 --> 01:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
provide some support to to um ambulances
 
01:10:46.189 --> 01:10:46.199 align:start position:0%
in terms of times when ambulances go out
 
01:10:49.310 --> 01:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
to a setting they may to provide
 
01:10:50.790 --> 01:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
treatment but they don't actually have
 
01:10:53.830 --> 01:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
to transport and um we we'll get to that
 
01:10:57.310 --> 01:10:57.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:00.229 --> 01:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
representative Neno for a question yeah
 
01:11:02.110 --> 01:11:02.120 align:start position:0%
I just want to make the comment that uh
 
01:11:04.709 --> 01:11:04.719 align:start position:0%
that was greatly appreciated especially
 
01:11:06.550 --> 01:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
in rural communities such as in the
 
01:11:08.709 --> 01:11:08.719 align:start position:0%
district that I represent where that
 
01:11:10.950 --> 01:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
increase made a big difference in
 
01:11:13.149 --> 01:11:13.159 align:start position:0%
especially in the cases where they made
 
01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:15.280 align:start position:0%
a call provided services but because
 
01:11:17.070 --> 01:11:17.080 align:start position:0%
they didn't transport weren't
 
01:11:19.790 --> 01:11:19.800 align:start position:0%
compensated for it so I want to thank
 
01:11:22.709 --> 01:11:22.719 align:start position:0%
everybody that was involved uh in
 
01:11:26.709 --> 01:11:26.719 align:start position:0%
helping to get those rate rate increases
 
01:11:29.110 --> 01:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
and I also you know it had the secondary
 
01:11:31.870 --> 01:11:31.880 align:start position:0%
benefit I think to um a former city
 
01:11:34.630 --> 01:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
counselor had nine terms in Laconia and
 
01:11:37.750 --> 01:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
you know in terms of what what uh
 
01:11:40.030 --> 01:11:40.040 align:start position:0%
taxpayers have to pay to provide EMS
 
01:11:42.590 --> 01:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
Services it also help Town budget so I
 
01:11:44.629 --> 01:11:44.639 align:start position:0%
think it had a double benefit if you
 
01:11:47.270 --> 01:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
will as I recall last turn
 
01:11:49.270 --> 01:11:49.280 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham had a hand in
 
01:11:53.669 --> 01:11:53.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:58.030 --> 01:11:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:59.229 --> 01:11:59.239 align:start position:0%
proceed Mr
 
01:11:59.239 --> 01:12:00.910 align:start position:0%
proceed Mr
Lipman

01:12:00.910 --> 01:12:00.920 align:start position:0%
Lipman
 
01:12:05.229 --> 01:12:05.239 align:start position:0%
um the next one um is again another hb2
 
01:12:07.350 --> 01:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
provision um trying to remember which
 
01:12:09.790 --> 01:12:09.800 align:start position:0%
one that's for if you can look at that
 
01:12:11.709 --> 01:12:11.719 align:start position:0%
for a moment the state plan service the
 
01:12:13.629 --> 01:12:13.639 align:start position:0%
general one there
 
01:12:13.639 --> 01:12:15.430 align:start position:0%
general one there
239

01:12:15.430 --> 01:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
239
 
01:12:21.310 --> 01:12:21.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:25.790 --> 01:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
sure sure um what what Nathan suggest we
 
01:12:27.790 --> 01:12:27.800 align:start position:0%
actually put together a report for
 
01:12:30.149 --> 01:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee um which was required
 
01:12:33.950 --> 01:12:33.960 align:start position:0%
in hb2 that shows um the 100
 
01:12:36.350 --> 01:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
approximately $134 million in
 
01:12:39.709 --> 01:12:39.719 align:start position:0%
Appropriations and where it went um a
 
01:12:42.830 --> 01:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
large part of it did go to um the
 
01:12:44.470 --> 01:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
Community Based Services Home and
 
01:12:46.430 --> 01:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
Community Based Services which has made
 
01:12:48.870 --> 01:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
a difference in terms of access there
 
01:12:50.270 --> 01:12:50.280 align:start position:0%
but rather than maybe going through all
 
01:12:52.709 --> 01:12:52.719 align:start position:0%
these I could um send to you that um
 
01:12:54.830 --> 01:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
letter that went to fiscal terms of
 
01:12:57.390 --> 01:12:57.400 align:start position:0%
saving a little bit of time here yeah
 
01:13:00.910 --> 01:13:00.920 align:start position:0%
and and at a high level um how the $134
 
01:13:04.590 --> 01:13:04.600 align:start position:0%
million um was allocated essentially
 
01:13:06.870 --> 01:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
there was a 3% rate increase effective
 
01:13:10.629 --> 01:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
July 1 of the first year of the spum and
 
01:13:12.629 --> 01:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
then there was a portion of funds that
 
01:13:14.790 --> 01:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
was allocated for targeted rate
 
01:13:16.709 --> 01:13:16.719 align:start position:0%
increases that took effect during the
 
01:13:19.750 --> 01:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
second quarter of State fiscal year 24
 
01:13:22.070 --> 01:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
and then the remainder went into effect
 
01:13:26.590 --> 01:13:26.600 align:start position:0%
January 1 of um excuse me the first yes
 
01:13:28.590 --> 01:13:28.600 align:start position:0%
of January 1
 
01:13:32.030 --> 01:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
2024 uh and and the the document that
 
01:13:34.550 --> 01:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
that Henry referred to that provides a
 
01:13:36.030 --> 01:13:36.040 align:start position:0%
high it provides a couple of
 
01:13:37.550 --> 01:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets as well as a high level
 
01:13:40.350 --> 01:13:40.360 align:start position:0%
overview of how those um how those rate
 
01:13:42.910 --> 01:13:42.920 align:start position:0%
increases were were allocated and a
 
01:13:44.470 --> 01:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
portion of them were at the
 
01:13:47.590 --> 01:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner's discretion um identifying
 
01:13:49.910 --> 01:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
uh High higher needs areas or areas
 
01:13:52.709 --> 01:13:52.719 align:start position:0%
where the rates were uh a little more a
 
01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:54.440 align:start position:0%
skew with standard Medicare or
 
01:13:59.430 --> 01:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:00.950 --> 01:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
um number
 
01:14:04.510 --> 01:14:04.520 align:start position:0%
25 um I do have a dollar value for this
 
01:14:07.550 --> 01:14:07.560 align:start position:0%
one and I I'll have to Circle back on
 
01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:09.910 align:start position:0%
one and I I'll have to Circle back on
that

01:14:09.910 --> 01:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:14:13.149 --> 01:14:13.159 align:start position:0%
um but and representative Neno for a
 
01:14:16.110 --> 01:14:16.120 align:start position:0%
question very quick question the the
 
01:14:19.189 --> 01:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
overlap between item 16 which is the
 
01:14:23.070 --> 01:14:23.080 align:start position:0%
duala the uh birthing centers and The
 
01:14:25.709 --> 01:14:25.719 align:start position:0%
Midwives so I I was kind intrigued by
 
01:14:28.110 --> 01:14:28.120 align:start position:0%
the fact that uh less allocated for
 
01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
midwives which is kind of the more
 
01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
traditional um uh
 
01:14:35.870 --> 01:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
alternative uh is it because the duala
 
01:14:37.790 --> 01:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
thing is new that it got allocated more
 
01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:38.790 align:start position:0%
thing is new that it got allocated more
funds

01:14:38.790 --> 01:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:14:42.189 --> 01:14:42.199 align:start position:0%
or and and is there an overlap in those
 
01:14:42.199 --> 01:14:43.870 align:start position:0%
or and and is there an overlap in those
three

01:14:43.870 --> 01:14:43.880 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:14:49.950 --> 01:14:49.960 align:start position:0%
items so there was um I think in in
 
01:14:53.110 --> 01:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
um so so they they they actually
 
01:14:55.470 --> 01:14:55.480 align:start position:0%
represent different actions so so the
 
01:14:58.629 --> 01:14:58.639 align:start position:0%
The Midwives was a rate increase whereas
 
01:15:00.550 --> 01:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
the The Duel is that was adding the
 
01:15:02.709 --> 01:15:02.719 align:start position:0%
coverage okay yeah so it's it's not
 
01:15:04.669 --> 01:15:04.679 align:start position:0%
necessarily one: one what you're looking
 
01:15:07.030 --> 01:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
at here and birthing centers is a
 
01:15:09.590 --> 01:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
totally different you know midwives
 
01:15:12.430 --> 01:15:12.440 align:start position:0%
aren't using birthing centers so so
 
01:15:14.990 --> 01:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
there's a a technical the facility
 
01:15:17.990 --> 01:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
component to birthing centers for the
 
01:15:19.910 --> 01:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
facil like a hospital right there's
 
01:15:21.189 --> 01:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
typically you go when you have a
 
01:15:23.070 --> 01:15:23.080 align:start position:0%
hospital admission you you pay the
 
01:15:25.510 --> 01:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
hospital for sort of the in tional can
 
01:15:27.750 --> 01:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
the doctor component the equivalent here
 
01:15:29.590 --> 01:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
would be the Midwife has a professional
 
01:15:31.669 --> 01:15:31.679 align:start position:0%
component there those are the with five
 
01:15:37.310 --> 01:15:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:43.790 --> 01:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
yes so I think I can um Jump Ahead to
 
01:15:46.950 --> 01:15:46.960 align:start position:0%
um 25 I'm going to um come back with a
 
01:15:49.430 --> 01:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
number but part of
 
01:15:51.629 --> 01:15:51.639 align:start position:0%
um when we get into the waiver
 
01:15:55.030 --> 01:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
discussion a little bit more um
 
01:15:58.110 --> 01:15:58.120 align:start position:0%
there are two things that have um have
 
01:16:00.830 --> 01:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
gone on and you'll see a couple more
 
01:16:04.350 --> 01:16:04.360 align:start position:0%
references in general we we applied for
 
01:16:06.950 --> 01:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
a waiver um with the approval of the
 
01:16:10.470 --> 01:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
governor to um support transitions of
 
01:16:13.390 --> 01:16:13.400 align:start position:0%
individuals coming out of the correction
 
01:16:17.510 --> 01:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
system and um there're about 20
 
01:16:21.510 --> 01:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
something states that have um G have
 
01:16:23.629 --> 01:16:23.639 align:start position:0%
this waiver and what it allows for
 
01:16:25.669 --> 01:16:25.679 align:start position:0%
there's typically what they call an
 
01:16:28.189 --> 01:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
inmate exclusion that Medicaid dollars
 
01:16:33.030 --> 01:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
cannot be used um in behind the full
 
01:16:37.189 --> 01:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
walls so um New Hampshire's approach to
 
01:16:41.910 --> 01:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
this um what we saw from data um that
 
01:16:46.189 --> 01:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections and um um the
 
01:16:47.790 --> 01:16:47.800 align:start position:0%
Council of state governments analyzing
 
01:16:50.950 --> 01:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's why do people have
 
01:16:53.470 --> 01:16:53.480 align:start position:0%
recidivism back into the correction
 
01:16:55.709 --> 01:16:55.719 align:start position:0%
system it's often because of mental
 
01:16:58.709 --> 01:16:58.719 align:start position:0%
health or substance use disorder issues
 
01:17:00.870 --> 01:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
so the the goal of this program is to
 
01:17:04.030 --> 01:17:04.040 align:start position:0%
provide a limited benefit which now the
 
01:17:07.669 --> 01:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
feds will share in the cost um that will
 
01:17:10.669 --> 01:17:10.679 align:start position:0%
probably the most valuable one to the to
 
01:17:12.629 --> 01:17:12.639 align:start position:0%
the corrections is discharge
 
01:17:15.990 --> 01:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
prescriptions rather than um the the
 
01:17:18.430 --> 01:17:18.440 align:start position:0%
state or the county having to pick up
 
01:17:20.830 --> 01:17:20.840 align:start position:0%
the discharge prescription that a 30-day
 
01:17:24.229 --> 01:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
supply of medication for uh can be
 
01:17:24.239 --> 01:17:25.470 align:start position:0%
supply of medication for uh can be
provided

01:17:25.470 --> 01:17:25.480 align:start position:0%
provided
 
01:17:28.950 --> 01:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
um to an individual so that's on the
 
01:17:32.470 --> 01:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
cost side I think that is a value um
 
01:17:35.550 --> 01:17:35.560 align:start position:0%
because um among the transitional issues
 
01:17:37.629 --> 01:17:37.639 align:start position:0%
that someone has is if you can't get
 
01:17:40.110 --> 01:17:40.120 align:start position:0%
your medications you sometimes end up in
 
01:17:41.790 --> 01:17:41.800 align:start position:0%
emergency rooms which is a lot more
 
01:17:45.390 --> 01:17:45.400 align:start position:0%
expensive for us in Behind the Walls if
 
01:17:48.669 --> 01:17:48.679 align:start position:0%
you will um part of the the transition
 
01:17:52.350 --> 01:17:52.360 align:start position:0%
is to um planning is to connect them to
 
01:17:54.110 --> 01:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
the types of providers that they're
 
01:17:57.189 --> 01:17:57.199 align:start position:0%
going to need need to see um when
 
01:17:59.229 --> 01:17:59.239 align:start position:0%
they're when they leave the correction
 
01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
setting so for example they might get if
 
01:18:04.390 --> 01:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
they have mental health treatment or
 
01:18:07.510 --> 01:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
substit disorder treatment in behind
 
01:18:09.470 --> 01:18:09.480 align:start position:0%
prisons the state has been investing
 
01:18:12.629 --> 01:18:12.639 align:start position:0%
with state general dollars uh to get
 
01:18:15.310 --> 01:18:15.320 align:start position:0%
people uh rehabilitated or to provide
 
01:18:18.790 --> 01:18:18.800 align:start position:0%
services that are needed um so rather
 
01:18:21.910 --> 01:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
than having them leave the prison um
 
01:18:26.030 --> 01:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
setting or uh or the correction setting
 
01:18:28.350 --> 01:18:28.360 align:start position:0%
and have no connection to the community
 
01:18:30.629 --> 01:18:30.639 align:start position:0%
providers there's a higher chance that
 
01:18:33.149 --> 01:18:33.159 align:start position:0%
they're going to have a problem and end
 
01:18:37.310 --> 01:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
up back in which is a costly setting so
 
01:18:40.950 --> 01:18:40.960 align:start position:0%
for for fairly small dollars in the
 
01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:42.430 align:start position:0%
for for fairly small dollars in the
Medicaid

01:18:42.430 --> 01:18:42.440 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
 
01:18:45.950 --> 01:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
Program um in fact this this waiver has
 
01:18:50.149 --> 01:18:50.159 align:start position:0%
to be budget neutral um uh That We
 
01:18:53.229 --> 01:18:53.239 align:start position:0%
Believe by providing better transition
 
01:18:55.229 --> 01:18:55.239 align:start position:0%
management preparator
 
01:18:57.149 --> 01:18:57.159 align:start position:0%
transition management meaning connecting
 
01:18:59.310 --> 01:18:59.320 align:start position:0%
providers people to their providers that
 
01:19:00.750 --> 01:19:00.760 align:start position:0%
they're going to need
 
01:19:03.189 --> 01:19:03.199 align:start position:0%
outside um making sure they have the
 
01:19:04.950 --> 01:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
medications they need and if they
 
01:19:06.870 --> 01:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
qualify for Medicaid when they leave
 
01:19:09.229 --> 01:19:09.239 align:start position:0%
which they probably would since they
 
01:19:12.149 --> 01:19:12.159 align:start position:0%
have no income coming out that we get
 
01:19:14.110 --> 01:19:14.120 align:start position:0%
them connected so that there's a
 
01:19:16.229 --> 01:19:16.239 align:start position:0%
successful transition and that if
 
01:19:18.270 --> 01:19:18.280 align:start position:0%
services are accessed they're accessed
 
01:19:20.990 --> 01:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
in the least costly setting because you
 
01:19:22.629 --> 01:19:22.639 align:start position:0%
know my experience before coming to the
 
01:19:25.030 --> 01:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
state I work for hospitals for several
 
01:19:26.950 --> 01:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
decades and you know one of the things I
 
01:19:29.189 --> 01:19:29.199 align:start position:0%
observed in the community I lived in is
 
01:19:32.070 --> 01:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
that people would bounce from um the
 
01:19:35.310 --> 01:19:35.320 align:start position:0%
county uh prison to the emergency room
 
01:19:37.310 --> 01:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
because sometimes they didn't have the
 
01:19:39.590 --> 01:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
medications that they needed um and it's
 
01:19:41.790 --> 01:19:41.800 align:start position:0%
not just mental health it could be their
 
01:19:43.709 --> 01:19:43.719 align:start position:0%
their cardiac met or blood pressure met
 
01:19:45.669 --> 01:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
or something like that so I think what
 
01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
the idea here in this
 
01:19:51.310 --> 01:19:51.320 align:start position:0%
waiver is to make sure that we manage
 
01:19:54.030 --> 01:19:54.040 align:start position:0%
transition so people could be successful
 
01:19:56.350 --> 01:19:56.360 align:start position:0%
and and build upon the investment the
 
01:19:58.189 --> 01:19:58.199 align:start position:0%
state has made while they've been behind
 
01:20:01.030 --> 01:20:01.040 align:start position:0%
bars and then to try to make them um
 
01:20:02.510 --> 01:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity to be productive
 
01:20:05.990 --> 01:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
person in society as well um and so
 
01:20:08.750 --> 01:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
that's kind of what's behind that one
 
01:20:11.390 --> 01:20:11.400 align:start position:0%
and there's also um a federal
 
01:20:12.470 --> 01:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
requirement which I'll talk about a
 
01:20:15.310 --> 01:20:15.320 align:start position:0%
little bit more later too for juveniles
 
01:20:20.110 --> 01:20:20.120 align:start position:0%
to provide um Services uh pre-release
 
01:20:22.950 --> 01:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
and as they come into the community um
 
01:20:25.550 --> 01:20:25.560 align:start position:0%
uh case management servic
 
01:20:27.310 --> 01:20:27.320 align:start position:0%
that one's required of every state to
 
01:20:32.189 --> 01:20:32.199 align:start position:0%
implement um again the the history of of
 
01:20:35.990 --> 01:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
children coming out of like an syc
 
01:20:40.070 --> 01:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
setting you know dcyf setting um is that
 
01:20:41.590 --> 01:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
you know the transitions into the
 
01:20:44.070 --> 01:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
community are really important um points
 
01:20:45.990 --> 01:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
in making sure they're connected to the
 
01:20:48.070 --> 01:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
providers that they need making sure
 
01:20:51.189 --> 01:20:51.199 align:start position:0%
that the preventative Services that they
 
01:20:53.709 --> 01:20:53.719 align:start position:0%
should have received are are accounted
 
01:20:55.390 --> 01:20:55.400 align:start position:0%
for and provided
 
01:20:57.030 --> 01:20:57.040 align:start position:0%
um before they bake it back into the
 
01:20:58.629 --> 01:20:58.639 align:start position:0%
community and then to make sure that
 
01:21:00.709 --> 01:21:00.719 align:start position:0%
they're successfully reintegrating into
 
01:21:00.719 --> 01:21:01.790 align:start position:0%
they're successfully reintegrating into
the

01:21:01.790 --> 01:21:01.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:21:05.750 --> 01:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
community um so you know just getting
 
01:21:10.149 --> 01:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
back to this uh um see was on number
 
01:21:10.159 --> 01:21:12.189 align:start position:0%
back to this uh um see was on number
20

01:21:12.189 --> 01:21:12.199 align:start position:0%
20
 
01:21:12.199 --> 01:21:14.229 align:start position:0%
20
um

01:21:14.229 --> 01:21:14.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:17.669 --> 01:21:17.679 align:start position:0%
2025 was where I was talking started to
 
01:21:21.550 --> 01:21:21.560 align:start position:0%
to talk about the adult program and 27
 
01:21:26.669 --> 01:21:26.679 align:start position:0%
is the is the the program for youth um
 
01:21:29.470 --> 01:21:29.480 align:start position:0%
and in between that is number 26 which
 
01:21:32.709 --> 01:21:32.719 align:start position:0%
is a bill that um was actually passed by
 
01:21:35.189 --> 01:21:35.199 align:start position:0%
both the house and the Senate um in two
 
01:21:37.229 --> 01:21:37.239 align:start position:0%
different versions but basically the
 
01:21:40.390 --> 01:21:40.400 align:start position:0%
same thing to provide um some
 
01:21:44.470 --> 01:21:44.480 align:start position:0%
reimbursement to um ambul EMS calls
 
01:21:46.709 --> 01:21:46.719 align:start position:0%
where there's treatment provided and
 
01:21:49.070 --> 01:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
here again I think the experience um
 
01:21:52.629 --> 01:21:52.639 align:start position:0%
that we saw from other states on this is
 
01:21:55.390 --> 01:21:55.400 align:start position:0%
that while there'll be some cost to
 
01:21:58.390 --> 01:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
reimbursing for those Services avoiding
 
01:22:00.430 --> 01:22:00.440 align:start position:0%
um a situation where someone doesn't
 
01:22:01.910 --> 01:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
have to go to an emergency room to get
 
01:22:05.070 --> 01:22:05.080 align:start position:0%
cleared um that that's going to be a
 
01:22:06.990 --> 01:22:07.000 align:start position:0%
savings to state but we didn't build in
 
01:22:08.629 --> 01:22:08.639 align:start position:0%
the savings we just built in the
 
01:22:10.910 --> 01:22:10.920 align:start position:0%
additional cost at this
 
01:22:14.110 --> 01:22:14.120 align:start position:0%
point representative Neno for question
 
01:22:18.350 --> 01:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
very quick question that that's uh the
 
01:22:22.830 --> 01:22:22.840 align:start position:0%
uh number 19 and number 26 are are
 
01:22:25.750 --> 01:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
linked or so they happened in different
 
01:22:31.270 --> 01:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
years um those so actually prior to hb2
 
01:22:32.910 --> 01:22:32.920 align:start position:0%
um there was some improvement in
 
01:22:36.070 --> 01:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
ambulance rates and then the big lift up
 
01:22:40.270 --> 01:22:40.280 align:start position:0%
to Medicare was um part of hp2 of 2023
 
01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
and this was passed just this past
 
01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:43.910 align:start position:0%
and this was passed just this past
session

01:22:43.910 --> 01:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
session
 
01:22:46.790 --> 01:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
um yeah so it's part and parcel of the
 
01:22:50.350 --> 01:22:50.360 align:start position:0%
same uh solution to an existing problem
 
01:22:52.870 --> 01:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
which is basically uncompensated uh
 
01:22:57.270 --> 01:22:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:00.270 --> 01:23:00.280 align:start position:0%
um so I think um representative
 
01:23:02.310 --> 01:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
Stringham for a question yeah can you
 
01:23:06.790 --> 01:23:06.800 align:start position:0%
just um um give us the status of the uh
 
01:23:09.510 --> 01:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh the waiver um to implement the
 
01:23:13.189 --> 01:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
non-transport ambulance rates and uh and
 
01:23:16.550 --> 01:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
what's been going on with that so the
 
01:23:20.030 --> 01:23:20.040 align:start position:0%
one one where we're sorry my phone is
 
01:23:26.189 --> 01:23:26.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:31.830 --> 01:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
um the um we've done our research we
 
01:23:34.990 --> 01:23:35.000 align:start position:0%
have the state plan drafted one of the
 
01:23:37.470 --> 01:23:37.480 align:start position:0%
things we're clarifying is that the
 
01:23:39.830 --> 01:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
House and Senate passed identical bills
 
01:23:42.470 --> 01:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
with identical Appropriations and so I
 
01:23:45.149 --> 01:23:45.159 align:start position:0%
think we're trying to clarify how that's
 
01:23:48.270 --> 01:23:48.280 align:start position:0%
dealt with as a technical issue
 
01:23:50.470 --> 01:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
um not sure if you have any update to
 
01:23:53.070 --> 01:23:53.080 align:start position:0%
that yet no so that we need to we need
 
01:23:56.350 --> 01:23:56.360 align:start position:0%
to get the funds I think um you know we
 
01:24:00.310 --> 01:24:00.320 align:start position:0%
view this as a savings based on um you
 
01:24:01.910 --> 01:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
know Kentucky is one of the states that
 
01:24:04.830 --> 01:24:04.840 align:start position:0%
are actuary serves and that we so we'll
 
01:24:06.390 --> 01:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
look to implement that as soon as we can
 
01:24:15.310 --> 01:24:15.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:20.070 --> 01:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:25.229 --> 01:24:25.239 align:start position:0%
um okay so 27 and and and
 
01:24:25.239 --> 01:24:27.590 align:start position:0%
um okay so 27 and and and
28

01:24:27.590 --> 01:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
28
 
01:24:31.030 --> 01:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
um I think we're all dealing with the
 
01:24:35.510 --> 01:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
the same those the waiver for um to be
 
01:24:38.149 --> 01:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
able to provide that Community re-entry
 
01:24:38.159 --> 01:24:39.910 align:start position:0%
able to provide that Community re-entry
benefit

01:24:39.910 --> 01:24:39.920 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
01:24:43.629 --> 01:24:43.639 align:start position:0%
um and they just requireed different
 
01:24:45.870 --> 01:24:45.880 align:start position:0%
different uh vehicles to get the
 
01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
authorities from CMS in place to be able
 
01:24:50.470 --> 01:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
01:24:52.990 --> 01:24:53.000 align:start position:0%
um then uh
 
01:24:54.950 --> 01:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
29 um
 
01:24:58.229 --> 01:24:58.239 align:start position:0%
as part of hb2 2023 there was a
 
01:25:01.310 --> 01:25:01.320 align:start position:0%
component to ask the department to apply
 
01:25:04.830 --> 01:25:04.840 align:start position:0%
for a waiver for presumptive eligibility
 
01:25:06.669 --> 01:25:06.679 align:start position:0%
for people who would qualify for Home
 
01:25:09.229 --> 01:25:09.239 align:start position:0%
and Community Based Services and the
 
01:25:11.870 --> 01:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
concept here
 
01:25:13.870 --> 01:25:13.880 align:start position:0%
um was
 
01:25:17.510 --> 01:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
that um sometimes it takes a while for a
 
01:25:19.629 --> 01:25:19.639 align:start position:0%
family to put together the documentation
 
01:25:22.149 --> 01:25:22.159 align:start position:0%
to be able to meet all the eligibility
 
01:25:24.669 --> 01:25:24.679 align:start position:0%
requirements so we're trying to avoid
 
01:25:26.590 --> 01:25:26.600 align:start position:0%
here is situation where someone
 
01:25:28.870 --> 01:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
decompensates while that eligibility
 
01:25:30.950 --> 01:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
process is playing out to be able to put
 
01:25:33.030 --> 01:25:33.040 align:start position:0%
certain services in place so that they
 
01:25:35.350 --> 01:25:35.360 align:start position:0%
can stay in the home as opposed to being
 
01:25:38.189 --> 01:25:38.199 align:start position:0%
institutionalized we were we filed that
 
01:25:43.910 --> 01:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:47.590 --> 01:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:49.510 --> 01:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
2020 I'm
 
01:25:55.510 --> 01:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
2024 um and um expect
 
01:25:56.629 --> 01:25:56.639 align:start position:0%
um excuse me though that would have been
 
01:26:00.750 --> 01:26:00.760 align:start position:0%
2023 sorry um September of 2023 where we
 
01:26:03.430 --> 01:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
filed the waiver um it was part of our
 
01:26:06.030 --> 01:26:06.040 align:start position:0%
larger 1115 waiver which was uh a
 
01:26:09.830 --> 01:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
continuation of our um waiver for
 
01:26:11.830 --> 01:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
institutional services for mental health
 
01:26:14.590 --> 01:26:14.600 align:start position:0%
IMD and substance use disorder where the
 
01:26:16.990 --> 01:26:17.000 align:start position:0%
state gets additional Federal funding
 
01:26:19.229 --> 01:26:19.239 align:start position:0%
that um otherwise isn't generally paid
 
01:26:21.870 --> 01:26:21.880 align:start position:0%
for without the waiver and those
 
01:26:23.590 --> 01:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
benefits are intended to support the
 
01:26:26.430 --> 01:26:26.440 align:start position:0%
state and the commity Based Services so
 
01:26:29.270 --> 01:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
we we made that request with the renewal
 
01:26:32.229 --> 01:26:32.239 align:start position:0%
CMS um
 
01:26:35.109 --> 01:26:35.119 align:start position:0%
U had a lot with the outgoing
 
01:26:36.790 --> 01:26:36.800 align:start position:0%
administration had a lot of waiver
 
01:26:38.390 --> 01:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
requests that they were processing and
 
01:26:40.990 --> 01:26:41.000 align:start position:0%
they said we believe we can approve this
 
01:26:44.030 --> 01:26:44.040 align:start position:0%
we're following what Washington State um
 
01:26:47.310 --> 01:26:47.320 align:start position:0%
largely had implemented they expected us
 
01:26:49.510 --> 01:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
to see this come get an approval
 
01:26:51.709 --> 01:26:51.719 align:start position:0%
sometime in
 
01:26:54.590 --> 01:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
2025 um I don't have any new information
 
01:26:58.229 --> 01:26:58.239 align:start position:0%
that it's different than that um but we
 
01:26:59.590 --> 01:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
we're expecting that will come out the
 
01:27:02.990 --> 01:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
other side again it's an an instance
 
01:27:06.430 --> 01:27:06.440 align:start position:0%
where you know you do pay for certain
 
01:27:09.950 --> 01:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
services but the actual cost of
 
01:27:12.910 --> 01:27:12.920 align:start position:0%
avoidance of institutionalization is is
 
01:27:16.910 --> 01:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
a saving so that the the waiver requires
 
01:27:20.669 --> 01:27:20.679 align:start position:0%
us to um come in at no more than what it
 
01:27:22.790 --> 01:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
costs us today and that's what the what
 
01:27:24.750 --> 01:27:24.760 align:start position:0%
we mean by budget neutrality
 
01:27:27.870 --> 01:27:27.880 align:start position:0%
representative Neno for a question so if
 
01:27:29.910 --> 01:27:29.920 align:start position:0%
I understand this correctly it's a casew
 
01:27:32.070 --> 01:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
worker that would look at us a given
 
01:27:34.750 --> 01:27:34.760 align:start position:0%
situation on the presumptive thing and
 
01:27:37.950 --> 01:27:37.960 align:start position:0%
say look uh this the circumstances here
 
01:27:40.629 --> 01:27:40.639 align:start position:0%
are pretty high probability that the
 
01:27:43.430 --> 01:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
they'll get the approval so we're uh
 
01:27:46.550 --> 01:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
Expediting the delivery of the service
 
01:27:49.189 --> 01:27:49.199 align:start position:0%
and then subject to uh at some point the
 
01:27:51.310 --> 01:27:51.320 align:start position:0%
paperwork being filed and and getting
 
01:27:53.390 --> 01:27:53.400 align:start position:0%
approved is that a correct description
 
01:27:55.990 --> 01:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
of what what talking about here I'd say
 
01:27:58.990 --> 01:27:59.000 align:start position:0%
generally I think that uh you're right
 
01:28:01.070 --> 01:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
there' be a clinical person assessing
 
01:28:05.550 --> 01:28:05.560 align:start position:0%
the the the situation to see what basic
 
01:28:07.629 --> 01:28:07.639 align:start position:0%
Services need to be put in place to
 
01:28:09.830 --> 01:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
avoid like we wouldn't place them in
 
01:28:11.709 --> 01:28:11.719 align:start position:0%
certain settings that would be long-term
 
01:28:13.590 --> 01:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
commitments for the state but we would
 
01:28:15.870 --> 01:28:15.880 align:start position:0%
put in place maybe like a homemaker
 
01:28:17.830 --> 01:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
service or make a a modification to
 
01:28:19.629 --> 01:28:19.639 align:start position:0%
their home while waiting for other
 
01:28:23.310 --> 01:28:23.320 align:start position:0%
things to come into play um okay thank
 
01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:26.750 align:start position:0%
things to come into play um okay thank
you

01:28:26.750 --> 01:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:28.470 --> 01:28:28.480 align:start position:0%
okay we made it through this the
 
01:28:30.390 --> 01:28:30.400 align:start position:0%
services now we're on the home stretch
 
01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:33.709 align:start position:0%
services now we're on the home stretch
here

01:28:33.709 --> 01:28:33.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:39.310 --> 01:28:39.320 align:start position:0%
um so um number one under eligibility um
 
01:28:41.470 --> 01:28:41.480 align:start position:0%
some of you may be familiar with the
 
01:28:44.750 --> 01:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
acronym mode Medicaid for older adults
 
01:28:47.510 --> 01:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
then we had the me which would for
 
01:28:51.590 --> 01:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
people who are younger um but basically
 
01:28:56.270 --> 01:28:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:01.189 --> 01:29:01.199 align:start position:0%
um sometimes have greater income than um
 
01:29:04.830 --> 01:29:04.840 align:start position:0%
would qualify them uh ordinarily but um
 
01:29:07.070 --> 01:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
it makes sense when if they incur
 
01:29:09.830 --> 01:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
certain level expenses to to provide
 
01:29:12.590 --> 01:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
eligibility um so we create was created
 
01:29:17.910 --> 01:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
that eligibility group um and then um in
 
01:29:23.070 --> 01:29:23.080 align:start position:0%
um there was a uh provision to um add uh
 
01:29:27.270 --> 01:29:27.280 align:start position:0%
premiums to that service
 
01:29:31.430 --> 01:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
um that um we actually couldn't end up
 
01:29:34.390 --> 01:29:34.400 align:start position:0%
implementing because of the the
 
01:29:36.109 --> 01:29:36.119 align:start position:0%
conditions associated with the federal
 
01:29:37.550 --> 01:29:37.560 align:start position:0%
Public Health Emergency of getting the
 
01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:38.870 align:start position:0%
Public Health Emergency of getting the
extra

01:29:38.870 --> 01:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
extra
 
01:29:41.830 --> 01:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
6.2% um that you couldn't change your
 
01:29:45.350 --> 01:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
eligibility requirements then as um
 
01:29:48.470 --> 01:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
things went on um there was uh a
 
01:29:52.790 --> 01:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
decision to not collect um the premiums
 
01:29:55.669 --> 01:29:55.679 align:start position:0%
there and so that's that's kind of
 
01:29:57.910 --> 01:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
what's happening in one and
 
01:30:03.910 --> 01:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
two um number three is the um the the
 
01:30:06.590 --> 01:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
last part of the mom R bill which was
 
01:30:08.790 --> 01:30:08.800 align:start position:0%
the 12 month of continuous coverage
 
01:30:12.550 --> 01:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
there are now 48 states that have the
 
01:30:15.590 --> 01:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
same uh element in place and the two
 
01:30:18.430 --> 01:30:18.440 align:start position:0%
states that um I think it was Wisconsin
 
01:30:20.830 --> 01:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
and Arkansas are actively working and
 
01:30:23.109 --> 01:30:23.119 align:start position:0%
putting it in place um in this current
 
01:30:26.430 --> 01:30:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:32.390 --> 01:30:32.400 align:start position:0%
um number four um is the um people who
 
01:30:34.950 --> 01:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
have in andout coverage meaning that
 
01:30:36.669 --> 01:30:36.679 align:start position:0%
unless they they generally wouldn't
 
01:30:38.229 --> 01:30:38.239 align:start position:0%
qualify for Medicaid but if their
 
01:30:40.790 --> 01:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
medical expenses are certain level they
 
01:30:43.790 --> 01:30:43.800 align:start position:0%
do get um eligibility and um the
 
01:30:48.070 --> 01:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
legislature has dealt with this um by
 
01:30:52.830 --> 01:30:52.840 align:start position:0%
increasing um the allowances that um in
 
01:30:54.590 --> 01:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
terms of what someone could have for
 
01:30:56.870 --> 01:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
expenses like I think you know when
 
01:30:58.750 --> 01:30:58.760 align:start position:0%
there was a huge increase in housing
 
01:31:02.070 --> 01:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
costs it really the the criteria use
 
01:31:03.910 --> 01:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
were were blown out of the water and I
 
01:31:06.790 --> 01:31:06.800 align:start position:0%
think that um the legislature made
 
01:31:09.030 --> 01:31:09.040 align:start position:0%
adjustments so that people who were
 
01:31:09.040 --> 01:31:09.990 align:start position:0%
adjustments so that people who were
previously

01:31:09.990 --> 01:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
previously
 
01:31:13.070 --> 01:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
qualifying um would continue to qualify
 
01:31:14.990 --> 01:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
because the expenses had gone up so much
 
01:31:18.870 --> 01:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
for individuals um and representative
 
01:31:21.590 --> 01:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
Nano has a question yeah I just want to
 
01:31:25.149 --> 01:31:25.159 align:start position:0%
come back to the um um the footnote here
 
01:31:27.790 --> 01:31:27.800 align:start position:0%
I you know where're we're I'm trying to
 
01:31:29.990 --> 01:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
understand the impact of covid and then
 
01:31:31.470 --> 01:31:31.480 align:start position:0%
more importantly the question as I
 
01:31:34.430 --> 01:31:34.440 align:start position:0%
recall it covid was over before it was
 
01:31:38.030 --> 01:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
officially declared over or I mean how
 
01:31:40.470 --> 01:31:40.480 align:start position:0%
did that impact so there's a date
 
01:31:41.990 --> 01:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
specific when somebody said the
 
01:31:45.390 --> 01:31:45.400 align:start position:0%
emergency is over even though it it you
 
01:31:49.310 --> 01:31:49.320 align:start position:0%
know there might have been U statements
 
01:31:52.910 --> 01:31:52.920 align:start position:0%
uh earlier on that it was over is that
 
01:31:54.629 --> 01:31:54.639 align:start position:0%
yeah so you're you're pointing out a
 
01:31:57.270 --> 01:31:57.280 align:start position:0%
little bit of uh tanglement kind of
 
01:32:03.950 --> 01:32:03.960 align:start position:0%
situation so in January of uh 20 uh 20
 
01:32:06.990 --> 01:32:07.000 align:start position:0%
actually on a retroactive basis the
 
01:32:09.189 --> 01:32:09.199 align:start position:0%
president Trump at the time declared a
 
01:32:10.990 --> 01:32:11.000 align:start position:0%
Federal Public Health Emergency related
 
01:32:13.910 --> 01:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
to covid and part of that was to provide
 
01:32:16.590 --> 01:32:16.600 align:start position:0%
States an enhanced Federal
 
01:32:21.990 --> 01:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
match the at the time the the that
 
01:32:24.990 --> 01:32:25.000 align:start position:0%
Federal Public Health Emergency had a
 
01:32:27.189 --> 01:32:27.199 align:start position:0%
certain duration of time I think it was
 
01:32:30.310 --> 01:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
90 days before it had to be renewed
 
01:32:35.109 --> 01:32:35.119 align:start position:0%
again and so there was in the initial
 
01:32:38.950 --> 01:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
couple years say 2021 there was this
 
01:32:41.030 --> 01:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
situation where we're getting ready for
 
01:32:42.629 --> 01:32:42.639 align:start position:0%
the federal Public Health Emergency to
 
01:32:44.709 --> 01:32:44.719 align:start position:0%
end and then it got extended and then it
 
01:32:48.070 --> 01:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
got extended then finally Congress acted
 
01:32:49.669 --> 01:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
to um
 
01:32:54.229 --> 01:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
provide a greater um level of of of
 
01:32:57.629 --> 01:32:57.639 align:start position:0%
notice and they then beyond that they
 
01:32:59.790 --> 01:32:59.800 align:start position:0%
came up with a specific date which was
 
01:33:04.229 --> 01:33:04.239 align:start position:0%
March 31st of uh of
 
01:33:08.709 --> 01:33:08.719 align:start position:0%
2023 but then the the fact that states
 
01:33:11.950 --> 01:33:11.960 align:start position:0%
had um increased enrollment they didn't
 
01:33:14.310 --> 01:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
immediately um you know in New Hampshire
 
01:33:16.510 --> 01:33:16.520 align:start position:0%
we went from where we are today of
 
01:33:19.510 --> 01:33:19.520 align:start position:0%
185,000 roughly to over
 
01:33:22.510 --> 01:33:22.520 align:start position:0%
250,000 you know they expected that it
 
01:33:25.709 --> 01:33:25.719 align:start position:0%
would take time for states to to
 
01:33:28.550 --> 01:33:28.560 align:start position:0%
re start or in the case of New Hampshire
 
01:33:31.149 --> 01:33:31.159 align:start position:0%
to we had we had kept a certain level of
 
01:33:33.310 --> 01:33:33.320 align:start position:0%
activity going through the public health
 
01:33:35.070 --> 01:33:35.080 align:start position:0%
emergency the whole time which is why we
 
01:33:36.629 --> 01:33:36.639 align:start position:0%
were one of the earlier states to be
 
01:33:39.229 --> 01:33:39.239 align:start position:0%
able to start and finish that unwind
 
01:33:42.590 --> 01:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
effort but basically giving States a a
 
01:33:45.790 --> 01:33:45.800 align:start position:0%
Runway to uh as they got back to regular
 
01:33:48.510 --> 01:33:48.520 align:start position:0%
levels of enrollment uh additional
 
01:33:51.430 --> 01:33:51.440 align:start position:0%
Federal funding and so in order to to
 
01:33:53.790 --> 01:33:53.800 align:start position:0%
get those funds um that extra money
 
01:33:56.189 --> 01:33:56.199 align:start position:0%
which is you know compared to the if you
 
01:33:59.470 --> 01:33:59.480 align:start position:0%
will I'm being a little um flip here and
 
01:34:01.030 --> 01:34:01.040 align:start position:0%
saying the pennies that would be
 
01:34:03.109 --> 01:34:03.119 align:start position:0%
collected in premion versus the millions
 
01:34:06.270 --> 01:34:06.280 align:start position:0%
that would be collected um by you know
 
01:34:09.310 --> 01:34:09.320 align:start position:0%
not not uh violating the the
 
01:34:11.430 --> 01:34:11.440 align:start position:0%
requirements um was was the decision
 
01:34:15.189 --> 01:34:15.199 align:start position:0%
that was made um and that made a lot of
 
01:34:18.590 --> 01:34:18.600 align:start position:0%
financial sense um and eventually that
 
01:34:21.830 --> 01:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
that 6.2% kept on going down till it
 
01:34:25.229 --> 01:34:25.239 align:start position:0%
ended um I think I think at a 2% level
 
01:34:27.229 --> 01:34:27.239 align:start position:0%
in in
 
01:34:31.709 --> 01:34:31.719 align:start position:0%
2020 December 2023 yes and
 
01:34:35.310 --> 01:34:35.320 align:start position:0%
uh so that's that's kind of went on
 
01:34:37.910 --> 01:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
there and then there was also another um
 
01:34:40.109 --> 01:34:40.119 align:start position:0%
provision that came into play there was
 
01:34:43.189 --> 01:34:43.199 align:start position:0%
um for to support Home and Community
 
01:34:45.030 --> 01:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
Based Services which took a big hit
 
01:34:49.750 --> 01:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
during the the pandemic um to um States
 
01:34:52.229 --> 01:34:52.239 align:start position:0%
could get a onetime enhanced Federal
 
01:34:54.790 --> 01:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
match of 10% their spending in Home and
 
01:34:57.510 --> 01:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
Community Based Services that there was
 
01:35:00.709 --> 01:35:00.719 align:start position:0%
also another condition that you had to
 
01:35:03.910 --> 01:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
um you know keep eligibility the same um
 
01:35:06.990 --> 01:35:07.000 align:start position:0%
and or you'd violate that that money so
 
01:35:08.629 --> 01:35:08.639 align:start position:0%
the combination of factors I think made
 
01:35:11.870 --> 01:35:11.880 align:start position:0%
it make sense not to really uh do this
 
01:35:13.790 --> 01:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
and I think you know that these are not
 
01:35:16.910 --> 01:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
people that are affluent it's just they
 
01:35:18.709 --> 01:35:18.719 align:start position:0%
have ongoing medical expenses that may
 
01:35:21.229 --> 01:35:21.239 align:start position:0%
be variable and so they're coming in an
 
01:35:24.310 --> 01:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
off and on Medicaid
 
01:35:28.030 --> 01:35:28.040 align:start position:0%
so so just a followup so net net all of
 
01:35:30.510 --> 01:35:30.520 align:start position:0%
that confusion and extensions and
 
01:35:33.750 --> 01:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
everything had a a a net negative or
 
01:35:35.990 --> 01:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
positive impact on on including
 
01:35:40.590 --> 01:35:40.600 align:start position:0%
including Moe becausee was you know part
 
01:35:42.350 --> 01:35:42.360 align:start position:0%
and parcel of that if I understand the
 
01:35:44.629 --> 01:35:44.639 align:start position:0%
footnote so I would say for New
 
01:35:47.510 --> 01:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that um the additional Federal
 
01:35:51.629 --> 01:35:51.639 align:start position:0%
match allowed us um to financially get
 
01:35:53.669 --> 01:35:53.679 align:start position:0%
through the the federal Public Health
 
01:35:56.990 --> 01:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
emergency pandemic period um in in an
 
01:35:59.430 --> 01:35:59.440 align:start position:0%
okay Financial way from Medicaid
 
01:36:03.870 --> 01:36:03.880 align:start position:0%
standpoint um we didn't have to um you
 
01:36:05.950 --> 01:36:05.960 align:start position:0%
know other than under
 
01:36:09.590 --> 01:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
the needing a little bit of liquor money
 
01:36:11.910 --> 01:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
to additional liquor money to maintain
 
01:36:14.590 --> 01:36:14.600 align:start position:0%
the the grant Advantage Program I mean I
 
01:36:16.990 --> 01:36:17.000 align:start position:0%
can't even remember but hundreds of
 
01:36:20.070 --> 01:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars that we took in um
 
01:36:22.070 --> 01:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
in terms of that extra Federal match and
 
01:36:25.149 --> 01:36:25.159 align:start position:0%
we may have had to to put that against
 
01:36:27.310 --> 01:36:27.320 align:start position:0%
maybe 16 million or something to that
 
01:36:33.669 --> 01:36:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:37.750 --> 01:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
you so we're down to four five and six
 
01:36:43.790 --> 01:36:43.800 align:start position:0%
here um on this page um so um in terms
 
01:36:48.149 --> 01:36:48.159 align:start position:0%
of the the In-N-Out Medicaid while we we
 
01:36:50.310 --> 01:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
made adjustments for
 
01:36:52.510 --> 01:36:52.520 align:start position:0%
eligibility they were it was a onetime
 
01:36:55.950 --> 01:36:55.960 align:start position:0%
adjustment then in 2023 they came back
 
01:36:58.510 --> 01:36:58.520 align:start position:0%
and provided
 
01:37:03.550 --> 01:37:03.560 align:start position:0%
um an adjustment that would occur um
 
01:37:06.830 --> 01:37:06.840 align:start position:0%
January um of each year it began
 
01:37:09.750 --> 01:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
actually U excuse
 
01:37:12.990 --> 01:37:13.000 align:start position:0%
me January and then July then annually
 
01:37:15.990 --> 01:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
thereafter um to provide some connection
 
01:37:19.189 --> 01:37:19.199 align:start position:0%
to the uh Consumer Price Index changes
 
01:37:21.350 --> 01:37:21.360 align:start position:0%
so that we don't end up in the same
 
01:37:23.149 --> 01:37:23.159 align:start position:0%
position of 10 years not addressing the
 
01:37:25.390 --> 01:37:25.400 align:start position:0%
eligib Billy levels and lots of people
 
01:37:27.750 --> 01:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
not making it on who are in the same
 
01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:32.390 align:start position:0%
not making it on who are in the same
place

01:37:32.390 --> 01:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:34.830 --> 01:37:34.840 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:37:38.470 --> 01:37:38.480 align:start position:0%
uh five
 
01:37:41.950 --> 01:37:41.960 align:start position:0%
um yeah there's some um additional
 
01:37:45.990 --> 01:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
protections of needing to serve uh
 
01:37:49.270 --> 01:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
former foster care um regardless of
 
01:37:50.990 --> 01:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
where you know if someone moved into
 
01:37:52.350 --> 01:37:52.360 align:start position:0%
your state or someone from our state
 
01:37:54.510 --> 01:37:54.520 align:start position:0%
moved into another state that we're
 
01:37:57.270 --> 01:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
supposed to provide the Medicaid up to
 
01:38:00.790 --> 01:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
age 20 till they turn
 
01:38:05.669 --> 01:38:05.679 align:start position:0%
26 um number six is the um elimination
 
01:38:09.830 --> 01:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
of of the premiums for um the mode that
 
01:38:12.950 --> 01:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:19.709 --> 01:38:19.719 align:start position:0%
earlier um number seven um is federally
 
01:38:21.470 --> 01:38:21.480 align:start position:0%
part of the Consolidated appropriation
 
01:38:24.950 --> 01:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
act um we
 
01:38:28.229 --> 01:38:28.239 align:start position:0%
um we U had to provide 12 months of
 
01:38:29.709 --> 01:38:29.719 align:start position:0%
continuous coverage for children that
 
01:38:31.550 --> 01:38:31.560 align:start position:0%
was not
 
01:38:35.470 --> 01:38:35.480 align:start position:0%
voluntary because our capitation rates
 
01:38:38.030 --> 01:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
already reflected because people had
 
01:38:41.229 --> 01:38:41.239 align:start position:0%
continuous enrollment already um during
 
01:38:43.669 --> 01:38:43.679 align:start position:0%
the federal Public Health Emergency we
 
01:38:46.070 --> 01:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
already had that cost built into our so
 
01:38:48.030 --> 01:38:48.040 align:start position:0%
there was no new additional cost that we
 
01:38:50.189 --> 01:38:50.199 align:start position:0%
had to account for in our capitation
 
01:38:51.870 --> 01:38:51.880 align:start position:0%
rates because we already had that built
 
01:38:54.950 --> 01:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
into our our base
 
01:38:59.310 --> 01:38:59.320 align:start position:0%
um number eight was um basically
 
01:39:01.990 --> 01:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
providing to lawfully residing women and
 
01:39:05.589 --> 01:39:05.599 align:start position:0%
children the same um benefit as the
 
01:39:07.870 --> 01:39:07.880 align:start position:0%
postpartum and continuous
 
01:39:12.390 --> 01:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
coverage um This was um there's a a cost
 
01:39:17.390 --> 01:39:17.400 align:start position:0%
total fund cost of uh 966 th000 but um
 
01:39:19.709 --> 01:39:19.719 align:start position:0%
this one we believe has a enhanced
 
01:39:22.070 --> 01:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
Federal match compared to uh just the
 
01:39:29.990 --> 01:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:33.950 --> 01:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
Federal um number nine representative
 
01:39:37.350 --> 01:39:37.360 align:start position:0%
Neno with a question a very quick
 
01:39:40.229 --> 01:39:40.239 align:start position:0%
question is there is there and this is
 
01:39:43.109 --> 01:39:43.119 align:start position:0%
language related and number eight a
 
01:39:46.870 --> 01:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
difference between lawfully residing and
 
01:39:51.750 --> 01:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
domiciled there's a lot of um uh in
 
01:39:54.629 --> 01:39:54.639 align:start position:0%
terms of the citizenship there's a lot
 
01:39:58.270 --> 01:39:58.280 align:start position:0%
of different um levels of of of how
 
01:39:59.870 --> 01:39:59.880 align:start position:0%
people are categorized there are
 
01:40:03.629 --> 01:40:03.639 align:start position:0%
individuals who um could be entitled to
 
01:40:05.390 --> 01:40:05.400 align:start position:0%
Medicaid benefits which are on a a
 
01:40:06.790 --> 01:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
voluntary basis and then there are
 
01:40:09.030 --> 01:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
people who who are not eligible until
 
01:40:10.910 --> 01:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
they have a five-year period and then
 
01:40:12.310 --> 01:40:12.320 align:start position:0%
there's other people who aren't eligible
 
01:40:14.350 --> 01:40:14.360 align:start position:0%
at all um
 
01:40:16.550 --> 01:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
this would probably be helpful if we
 
01:40:18.149 --> 01:40:18.159 align:start position:0%
provide if you're really interested to
 
01:40:20.430 --> 01:40:20.440 align:start position:0%
provide the specific citation of federal
 
01:40:24.350 --> 01:40:24.360 align:start position:0%
law that with this group is because it's
 
01:40:26.790 --> 01:40:26.800 align:start position:0%
uh you know the terminology sometimes is
 
01:40:28.709 --> 01:40:28.719 align:start position:0%
important yes it is there's a lot of
 
01:40:32.109 --> 01:40:32.119 align:start position:0%
nuances there and the choice of lawfully
 
01:40:35.510 --> 01:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
residing as opposed to permanently
 
01:40:39.310 --> 01:40:39.320 align:start position:0%
domiciled right or so this would cover
 
01:40:41.990 --> 01:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
somebody visiting from another state um
 
01:40:44.030 --> 01:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
this would be I think it's think of it
 
01:40:47.149 --> 01:40:47.159 align:start position:0%
more as um someone who is a
 
01:40:49.990 --> 01:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
noncitizen but is lawfully residing in
 
01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:50.790 align:start position:0%
noncitizen but is lawfully residing in
the

01:40:50.790 --> 01:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:40:54.470 --> 01:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
country based on Federal um rules it may
 
01:40:56.390 --> 01:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
be that they're waiting for like a
 
01:40:59.750 --> 01:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
refugee part of a refugee program or it
 
01:41:01.790 --> 01:41:01.800 align:start position:0%
may not necessar necessarily be a
 
01:41:04.510 --> 01:41:04.520 align:start position:0%
refugee program I think um there's a lot
 
01:41:06.990 --> 01:41:07.000 align:start position:0%
of nuance this one I think if you're
 
01:41:09.270 --> 01:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
interested I can give you the some
 
01:41:11.510 --> 01:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
reading on on that to to help if you
 
01:41:13.910 --> 01:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
want I'm sure it refers to federal law
 
01:41:15.790 --> 01:41:15.800 align:start position:0%
where where these these terms are
 
01:41:19.070 --> 01:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
defined exactly okay and and so the
 
01:41:21.070 --> 01:41:21.080 align:start position:0%
choice of that
 
01:41:23.470 --> 01:41:23.480 align:start position:0%
is I mean you can make some choices is
 
01:41:25.669 --> 01:41:25.679 align:start position:0%
on what wording that use I
 
01:41:28.229 --> 01:41:28.239 align:start position:0%
suppose ju just to clarify the the the
 
01:41:30.470 --> 01:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
language lawfully residing children um
 
01:41:32.709 --> 01:41:32.719 align:start position:0%
that that comes from from the hb2
 
01:41:35.430 --> 01:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
provision from chapter 79 for Section
 
01:41:38.229 --> 01:41:38.239 align:start position:0%
421 and in there it does site pursuant
 
01:41:40.589 --> 01:41:40.599 align:start position:0%
to section 214 uh children's health
 
01:41:42.830 --> 01:41:42.840 align:start position:0%
insurance program re reauthorization Act
 
01:41:45.229 --> 01:41:45.239 align:start position:0%
of 2009 so that's the reason that you
 
01:41:47.030 --> 01:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
see that language here we're trying to
 
01:41:49.510 --> 01:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
tie it directly to the hb2 provision
 
01:41:51.669 --> 01:41:51.679 align:start position:0%
that we're citing and the and then the
 
01:41:54.750 --> 01:41:54.760 align:start position:0%
htb2 provision ties to federal law it
 
01:41:56.750 --> 01:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
ties to the federal law exactly correct
 
01:41:56.760 --> 01:42:00.229 align:start position:0%
ties to the federal law exactly correct
thank

01:42:00.229 --> 01:42:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:02.589 --> 01:42:02.599 align:start position:0%
you and
 
01:42:07.070 --> 01:42:07.080 align:start position:0%
um number nine um this is part of the
 
01:42:12.629 --> 01:42:12.639 align:start position:0%
section um of the system of care for um
 
01:42:16.270 --> 01:42:16.280 align:start position:0%
adult and aging population in terms of
 
01:42:19.109 --> 01:42:19.119 align:start position:0%
um providing some
 
01:42:23.669 --> 01:42:23.679 align:start position:0%
um or eligibility to to allow
 
01:42:26.270 --> 01:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
individuals to have a little bit more
 
01:42:29.790 --> 01:42:29.800 align:start position:0%
assets um to to not be considered um
 
01:42:32.870 --> 01:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
there's also like the spousal
 
01:42:36.669 --> 01:42:36.679 align:start position:0%
relationships there this was um again an
 
01:42:41.270 --> 01:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
hb2 provision to um I think take into
 
01:42:45.430 --> 01:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
account again how um costs and and and
 
01:42:47.270 --> 01:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
being able to maintain yourself in the
 
01:42:49.990 --> 01:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
community um and to be able to qualify
 
01:42:54.589 --> 01:42:54.599 align:start position:0%
for services that um the ENT here was to
 
01:42:57.589 --> 01:42:57.599 align:start position:0%
to try to be more rational about who is
 
01:43:00.870 --> 01:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
getting eligibility and who is not um
 
01:43:02.990 --> 01:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
and not putting people in a position
 
01:43:06.070 --> 01:43:06.080 align:start position:0%
where they're so they have to go down so
 
01:43:08.750 --> 01:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
far that it costs the state more to to
 
01:43:15.350 --> 01:43:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:20.669 --> 01:43:20.679 align:start position:0%
on so number 10 um was one of the ones
 
01:43:24.629 --> 01:43:24.639 align:start position:0%
that uh the department um
 
01:43:28.310 --> 01:43:28.320 align:start position:0%
um dealt with is that we had um during
 
01:43:31.350 --> 01:43:31.360 align:start position:0%
the continuous eligibility we had
 
01:43:34.870 --> 01:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
children that we had to maintain um who
 
01:43:37.950 --> 01:43:37.960 align:start position:0%
might um have another source of
 
01:43:42.750 --> 01:43:42.760 align:start position:0%
insurance as well and um from the an
 
01:43:46.910 --> 01:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
audit that we had um in terms of
 
01:43:49.350 --> 01:43:49.360 align:start position:0%
um whether these children could be
 
01:43:52.470 --> 01:43:52.480 align:start position:0%
claimed at the 65% level or the 50%
 
01:43:56.790 --> 01:43:56.800 align:start position:0%
level um we um to to put the state in
 
01:43:59.550 --> 01:43:59.560 align:start position:0%
compliance we um use this eligibility
 
01:44:02.390 --> 01:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
group so that um we would be in
 
01:44:04.350 --> 01:44:04.360 align:start position:0%
compliance in terms of the federal match
 
01:44:06.270 --> 01:44:06.280 align:start position:0%
level that we were drawing on these
 
01:44:08.910 --> 01:44:08.920 align:start position:0%
children we do have third party
 
01:44:12.470 --> 01:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
liability um activities to make sure
 
01:44:15.950 --> 01:44:15.960 align:start position:0%
that uh Medicaid is the pay of Last
 
01:44:18.750 --> 01:44:18.760 align:start position:0%
Resort um some of these children will
 
01:44:20.350 --> 01:44:20.360 align:start position:0%
probably be the ones that would fall
 
01:44:22.669 --> 01:44:22.679 align:start position:0%
into the the premiums if those are
 
01:44:22.679 --> 01:44:28.669 align:start position:0%
into the the premiums if those are
adopted

01:44:28.669 --> 01:44:28.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:31.750 --> 01:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
um Madam
 
01:44:35.350 --> 01:44:35.360 align:start position:0%
chair representative Neno for a question
 
01:44:37.870 --> 01:44:37.880 align:start position:0%
so this is generally what I would think
 
01:44:42.310 --> 01:44:42.320 align:start position:0%
of as a coordination of benefits um um
 
01:44:46.550 --> 01:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
exercise yes um and who who has the
 
01:44:49.149 --> 01:44:49.159 align:start position:0%
overall responsibility in DHHS for
 
01:44:53.030 --> 01:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
managing the um coordination of Ben
 
01:44:55.750 --> 01:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
benefits uh part of this so there's a
 
01:44:57.510 --> 01:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
certain level of responsibility that's
 
01:45:02.270 --> 01:45:02.280 align:start position:0%
within the um manage Care Organization
 
01:45:04.750 --> 01:45:04.760 align:start position:0%
and then we also have um you met I think
 
01:45:08.550 --> 01:45:08.560 align:start position:0%
with Meredith talo earlier I believe um
 
01:45:12.750 --> 01:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
her Department of program Integrity um
 
01:45:15.430 --> 01:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
is the party that works to make sure
 
01:45:17.990 --> 01:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
that the for those who are in managed
 
01:45:20.830 --> 01:45:20.840 align:start position:0%
care that those activities are happening
 
01:45:24.550 --> 01:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
um as well as other um types of cost
 
01:45:26.070 --> 01:45:26.080 align:start position:0%
avoidance activities that you would
 
01:45:29.709 --> 01:45:29.719 align:start position:0%
otherwise um do in an insurance program
 
01:45:31.270 --> 01:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
um and then there you know there's a
 
01:45:33.870 --> 01:45:33.880 align:start position:0%
small element of our our Medicaid
 
01:45:35.510 --> 01:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
Program that are fee for service still
 
01:45:37.189 --> 01:45:37.199 align:start position:0%
and and then we have the responsibility
 
01:45:40.669 --> 01:45:40.679 align:start position:0%
in the department for that so we we
 
01:45:43.470 --> 01:45:43.480 align:start position:0%
Outsource we basically Outsource that
 
01:45:45.990 --> 01:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
piece of it to uh managed care
 
01:45:49.950 --> 01:45:49.960 align:start position:0%
facilities and then there's a the audit
 
01:45:51.510 --> 01:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
require I mean I guess what's happening
 
01:45:54.149 --> 01:45:54.159 align:start position:0%
on the quality section is it's uh uh
 
01:45:56.910 --> 01:45:56.920 align:start position:0%
qual but in between that who provides
 
01:46:00.030 --> 01:46:00.040 align:start position:0%
the oversight so so that's um meris
 
01:46:02.270 --> 01:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
Department the program Integrity to make
 
01:46:06.189 --> 01:46:06.199 align:start position:0%
sure that um we actually monitor them
 
01:46:07.790 --> 01:46:07.800 align:start position:0%
very closely on that activity because
 
01:46:09.750 --> 01:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
manag Care organizations sometimes
 
01:46:12.189 --> 01:46:12.199 align:start position:0%
that's not their strongest suit um right
 
01:46:14.790 --> 01:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
and we actually build into our manage
 
01:46:16.669 --> 01:46:16.679 align:start position:0%
care contract a certain level of
 
01:46:19.350 --> 01:46:19.360 align:start position:0%
performance on that activity whether
 
01:46:20.870 --> 01:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
they meet it or not we're going to take
 
01:46:22.910 --> 01:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
a credit against what we pay them in cap
 
01:46:24.950 --> 01:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
reputation um so there's an incentive
 
01:46:28.030 --> 01:46:28.040 align:start position:0%
for them to perform and we're also
 
01:46:29.870 --> 01:46:29.880 align:start position:0%
looking to strengthen our own
 
01:46:31.870 --> 01:46:31.880 align:start position:0%
capabilities in that area in terms of
 
01:46:35.990 --> 01:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
doing more data matching to to uh to
 
01:46:37.990 --> 01:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
strengthen that that whole activity even
 
01:46:39.430 --> 01:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
further we think there's still
 
01:46:45.310 --> 01:46:45.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:48.870 --> 01:46:48.880 align:start position:0%
you um and then
 
01:46:48.880 --> 01:46:50.870 align:start position:0%
you um and then
uh

01:46:50.870 --> 01:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:46:53.830 --> 01:46:53.840 align:start position:0%
see the last one um which doesn't have a
 
01:46:55.629 --> 01:46:55.639 align:start position:0%
number on it number would be otherwise
 
01:46:59.310 --> 01:46:59.320 align:start position:0%
number 11 um I think this was another
 
01:47:03.310 --> 01:47:03.320 align:start position:0%
action to um to provide um an this was
 
01:47:08.709 --> 01:47:08.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:12.310 --> 01:47:12.320 align:start position:0%
update that's a lot to digest M chairman
 
01:47:14.430 --> 01:47:14.440 align:start position:0%
and you presented it very well I'm in
 
01:47:16.910 --> 01:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
awe of how you can um do this almost on
 
01:47:18.470 --> 01:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
the Fly and uh that we're really
 
01:47:20.669 --> 01:47:20.679 align:start position:0%
fortunate to have you at the helm here
 
01:47:23.510 --> 01:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire uh dur
 
01:47:27.470 --> 01:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
medical equipment or supplies uh what
 
01:47:32.189 --> 01:47:32.199 align:start position:0%
percentage of that uh is determined and
 
01:47:34.669 --> 01:47:34.679 align:start position:0%
plans to control that so that would be
 
01:47:37.149 --> 01:47:37.159 align:start position:0%
known as
 
01:47:41.430 --> 01:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:44.109 --> 01:47:44.119 align:start position:0%
um durable medical equipment is the is
 
01:47:48.950 --> 01:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
the correct uh uh uh tme correct for the
 
01:47:53.589 --> 01:47:53.599 align:start position:0%
abbreviation of that um so in terms of
 
01:47:57.229 --> 01:47:57.239 align:start position:0%
um within the Managed Care Program um
 
01:47:59.310 --> 01:47:59.320 align:start position:0%
there's a requirement to provide needed
 
01:48:02.709 --> 01:48:02.719 align:start position:0%
Dural medical equipment um and that
 
01:48:06.390 --> 01:48:06.400 align:start position:0%
would be based on uh patients condition
 
01:48:08.589 --> 01:48:08.599 align:start position:0%
um the
 
01:48:14.550 --> 01:48:14.560 align:start position:0%
uh the legislature I think has um
 
01:48:17.830 --> 01:48:17.840 align:start position:0%
um provided um a change in the
 
01:48:21.390 --> 01:48:21.400 align:start position:0%
percentage on um I think in the last
 
01:48:25.149 --> 01:48:25.159 align:start position:0%
session from 80% to 90% of the um of
 
01:48:32.870 --> 01:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:36.149 --> 01:48:36.159 align:start position:0%
um um appliances that more like in the
 
01:48:38.750 --> 01:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
orthopedic space if you will that to
 
01:48:41.990 --> 01:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
support um Rehabilitation and and such
 
01:48:46.790 --> 01:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
but it is built into our our our program
 
01:48:50.310 --> 01:48:50.320 align:start position:0%
um today and um it's it's one of the
 
01:48:54.310 --> 01:48:54.320 align:start position:0%
areas that's a little bit challenging
 
01:48:58.310 --> 01:48:58.320 align:start position:0%
because in providing DME a lot of the
 
01:48:59.990 --> 01:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
things that you provide are
 
01:49:02.149 --> 01:49:02.159 align:start position:0%
Commodities um meaning that there's a
 
01:49:06.149 --> 01:49:06.159 align:start position:0%
national market and um you can buy it at
 
01:49:08.149 --> 01:49:08.159 align:start position:0%
a very low cost but there's also
 
01:49:11.229 --> 01:49:11.239 align:start position:0%
component of um sometimes going to the
 
01:49:14.189 --> 01:49:14.199 align:start position:0%
house and providing that service as well
 
01:49:17.870 --> 01:49:17.880 align:start position:0%
to instruct or to apply and so we've
 
01:49:21.470 --> 01:49:21.480 align:start position:0%
been um balancing in the Medicaid
 
01:49:25.470 --> 01:49:25.480 align:start position:0%
Program um the market Forces versus you
 
01:49:27.189 --> 01:49:27.199 align:start position:0%
know needing to make sure like the post
 
01:49:28.910 --> 01:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
office that you can deliver to any
 
01:49:31.870 --> 01:49:31.880 align:start position:0%
community in the state and so what we're
 
01:49:36.229 --> 01:49:36.239 align:start position:0%
we we tried to do um back in our second
 
01:49:37.870 --> 01:49:37.880 align:start position:0%
procurement of the Managed Care Program
 
01:49:41.189 --> 01:49:41.199 align:start position:0%
was to provide a floor to which
 
01:49:44.709 --> 01:49:44.719 align:start position:0%
um uh reimbursement could could happen
 
01:49:47.310 --> 01:49:47.320 align:start position:0%
and um there was a $3 million investment
 
01:49:51.270 --> 01:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
made at that time Managed Care Program
 
01:49:51.280 --> 01:49:52.830 align:start position:0%
made at that time Managed Care Program
and

01:49:52.830 --> 01:49:52.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:49:54.310 --> 01:49:54.320 align:start position:0%
think the DME providers are still
 
01:49:56.830 --> 01:49:56.840 align:start position:0%
struggling out there a bit on this
 
01:50:00.790 --> 01:50:00.800 align:start position:0%
because um you know they have um the
 
01:50:02.430 --> 01:50:02.440 align:start position:0%
Personnel cost and and the
 
01:50:05.390 --> 01:50:05.400 align:start position:0%
transportation cost to serve all parts
 
01:50:07.350 --> 01:50:07.360 align:start position:0%
of the state you know it's if you're
 
01:50:08.830 --> 01:50:08.840 align:start position:0%
located in downtown Manchester and
 
01:50:10.669 --> 01:50:10.679 align:start position:0%
serving Manchester is different than you
 
01:50:12.350 --> 01:50:12.360 align:start position:0%
know up in colbrook right in terms of
 
01:50:15.709 --> 01:50:15.719 align:start position:0%
serving the the North country and so um
 
01:50:18.229 --> 01:50:18.239 align:start position:0%
I think this is an area that we you know
 
01:50:20.430 --> 01:50:20.440 align:start position:0%
spend a lot of time on I think you know
 
01:50:22.109 --> 01:50:22.119 align:start position:0%
we in terms of the appropriation that we
 
01:50:24.229 --> 01:50:24.239 align:start position:0%
have to work with we're doing the best
 
01:50:27.990 --> 01:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
we can I'm sure you may be hearing from
 
01:50:30.709 --> 01:50:30.719 align:start position:0%
DME providers that they would like like
 
01:50:32.870 --> 01:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
more I think you did address part of
 
01:50:36.750 --> 01:50:36.760 align:start position:0%
that issue with the appliances that um
 
01:50:39.990 --> 01:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
that went up to 90% of Medicare um but
 
01:50:41.830 --> 01:50:41.840 align:start position:0%
it's it is a a challenging area in terms
 
01:50:45.390 --> 01:50:45.400 align:start position:0%
of making sure that um the state is a a
 
01:50:47.790 --> 01:50:47.800 align:start position:0%
good purchaser um but
 
01:50:50.870 --> 01:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
also you know there are costs for
 
01:50:53.709 --> 01:50:53.719 align:start position:0%
servicing the small areas it's
 
01:50:55.109 --> 01:50:55.119 align:start position:0%
and what we want to make sure is that
 
01:50:57.149 --> 01:50:57.159 align:start position:0%
the whole state can be served I'm not
 
01:50:58.990 --> 01:50:59.000 align:start position:0%
sure if there was more to what your
 
01:51:02.350 --> 01:51:02.360 align:start position:0%
question was but that's that was good um
 
01:51:05.189 --> 01:51:05.199 align:start position:0%
I have another question related uh to
 
01:51:06.830 --> 01:51:06.840 align:start position:0%
another service that wasn't mentioned
 
01:51:09.870 --> 01:51:09.880 align:start position:0%
but Homebase dialysis uh what is the
 
01:51:12.589 --> 01:51:12.599 align:start position:0%
Readiness or the interest in that and
 
01:51:15.470 --> 01:51:15.480 align:start position:0%
cost and transportation if you could
 
01:51:19.310 --> 01:51:19.320 align:start position:0%
discuss that sure um we do cover
 
01:51:23.229 --> 01:51:23.239 align:start position:0%
homebased dialysis today I know that um
 
01:51:25.790 --> 01:51:25.800 align:start position:0%
the chairman had mentioned to us about
 
01:51:28.669 --> 01:51:28.679 align:start position:0%
um a technology that is potentially
 
01:51:31.270 --> 01:51:31.280 align:start position:0%
coming out that uh would differentiate
 
01:51:34.790 --> 01:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
between what we do today um it's we're
 
01:51:37.510 --> 01:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to be looking into that uh
 
01:51:40.669 --> 01:51:40.679 align:start position:0%
based on his request uh to to do that
 
01:51:43.629 --> 01:51:43.639 align:start position:0%
but we do a lot of dialysis is picked up
 
01:51:46.149 --> 01:51:46.159 align:start position:0%
by Medicare that PE and Stage renal
 
01:51:49.830 --> 01:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
disease that usually the tenure on on
 
01:51:52.629 --> 01:51:52.639 align:start position:0%
Medicaid for dialysis usually picked up
 
01:51:54.189 --> 01:51:54.199 align:start position:0%
by Medicare because they qualify that
 
01:51:55.870 --> 01:51:55.880 align:start position:0%
way but we do have some people that
 
01:51:59.109 --> 01:51:59.119 align:start position:0%
don't qualifies and but uh we do provide
 
01:52:01.910 --> 01:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
all forms of dialysis that are currently
 
01:52:03.990 --> 01:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
available that the newest one that was
 
01:52:06.149 --> 01:52:06.159 align:start position:0%
brought to our attention where we need
 
01:52:08.470 --> 01:52:08.480 align:start position:0%
to take a look into
 
01:52:10.870 --> 01:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
that great thank
 
01:52:13.189 --> 01:52:13.199 align:start position:0%
you looks like we are approaching 11
 
01:52:16.430 --> 01:52:16.440 align:start position:0%
o'clock just as a time check uh no rush
 
01:52:18.430 --> 01:52:18.440 align:start position:0%
um we're about halfway through your
 
01:52:21.350 --> 01:52:21.360 align:start position:0%
slides and of course then we have um
 
01:52:23.550 --> 01:52:23.560 align:start position:0%
House Bill two provision
 
01:52:26.550 --> 01:52:26.560 align:start position:0%
so um however you'd like to proceed so I
 
01:52:28.950 --> 01:52:28.960 align:start position:0%
think the next part to get to the house
 
01:52:30.270 --> 01:52:30.280 align:start position:0%
bill to because I'm sure you want to
 
01:52:34.870 --> 01:52:34.880 align:start position:0%
spend time on that um the the next uh we
 
01:52:39.270 --> 01:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
were left the slide deck at uh onto page
 
01:52:42.870 --> 01:52:42.880 align:start position:0%
eight so this is in response to a
 
01:52:46.229 --> 01:52:46.239 align:start position:0%
request to share the waivers the state
 
01:52:46.239 --> 01:52:47.270 align:start position:0%
request to share the waivers the state
plan

01:52:47.270 --> 01:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
plan
 
01:52:50.270 --> 01:52:50.280 align:start position:0%
amendments that are in place today and
 
01:52:53.550 --> 01:52:53.560 align:start position:0%
basically 8 n
 
01:52:57.069 --> 01:52:57.079 align:start position:0%
our our water water in place when it
 
01:53:01.229 --> 01:53:01.239 align:start position:0%
began um and if it ended um there are a
 
01:53:04.510 --> 01:53:04.520 align:start position:0%
few that have ended
 
01:53:07.870 --> 01:53:07.880 align:start position:0%
um well not a few but um one at least
 
01:53:10.589 --> 01:53:10.599 align:start position:0%
that has ended the the co Health covid
 
01:53:13.510 --> 01:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
Public Health Emergency um 11:15 waiver
 
01:53:17.669 --> 01:53:17.679 align:start position:0%
ended um as did the disaster waiver um
 
01:53:21.270 --> 01:53:21.280 align:start position:0%
so um this is the list of of of individ
 
01:53:23.470 --> 01:53:23.480 align:start position:0%
of the different
 
01:53:25.790 --> 01:53:25.800 align:start position:0%
exceptions to ordinarily covered
 
01:53:30.830 --> 01:53:30.840 align:start position:0%
services that Medicaid provides um then
 
01:53:36.030 --> 01:53:36.040 align:start position:0%
on um page 10 um the page number didn't
 
01:53:39.149 --> 01:53:39.159 align:start position:0%
come out on that one sorry um is how it
 
01:53:41.589 --> 01:53:41.599 align:start position:0%
all sort of uh this another
 
01:53:43.270 --> 01:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
representation of what's on the prior
 
01:53:46.189 --> 01:53:46.199 align:start position:0%
page is what we call our waiver wheel um
 
01:53:47.750 --> 01:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
everything evolves
 
01:53:51.189 --> 01:53:51.199 align:start position:0%
around what we call the state plan um
 
01:53:54.109 --> 01:53:54.119 align:start position:0%
those are the required services and the
 
01:53:56.350 --> 01:53:56.360 align:start position:0%
optional services that that the state
 
01:53:59.149 --> 01:53:59.159 align:start position:0%
has adopted and then when you're asking
 
01:54:04.270 --> 01:54:04.280 align:start position:0%
for an exception to ordinary things um
 
01:54:06.550 --> 01:54:06.560 align:start position:0%
like the ones in pink um we talked about
 
01:54:09.109 --> 01:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
earlier the the personal care services
 
01:54:11.550 --> 01:54:11.560 align:start position:0%
to be able to that's ordinarily you need
 
01:54:14.510 --> 01:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
a special state plan Amendment called um
 
01:54:17.790 --> 01:54:17.800 align:start position:0%
a 1915 J which is at the top uh to be
 
01:54:20.470 --> 01:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
able to do this is just a in terms of
 
01:54:23.189 --> 01:54:23.199 align:start position:0%
the things that the Division of Medicaid
 
01:54:24.910 --> 01:54:24.920 align:start position:0%
services we work with all the other
 
01:54:26.550 --> 01:54:26.560 align:start position:0%
divisions and getting these things in
 
01:54:28.790 --> 01:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
place but we don't necessarily oversee
 
01:54:32.669 --> 01:54:32.679 align:start position:0%
them dayto day like um let's see the
 
01:54:34.510 --> 01:54:34.520 align:start position:0%
inhome support waiver would be a good
 
01:54:37.229 --> 01:54:37.239 align:start position:0%
example of that that provides you know
 
01:54:40.430 --> 01:54:40.440 align:start position:0%
services to U severely disabled children
 
01:54:43.390 --> 01:54:43.400 align:start position:0%
typically in their homes that their
 
01:54:45.030 --> 01:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
other parts of the department typically
 
01:54:46.550 --> 01:54:46.560 align:start position:0%
would be in long-term services and
 
01:54:49.470 --> 01:54:49.480 align:start position:0%
support and special medical needs but
 
01:54:51.149 --> 01:54:51.159 align:start position:0%
you know our role as the division of
 
01:54:52.910 --> 01:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
Medicaid is to provide
 
01:54:55.270 --> 01:54:55.280 align:start position:0%
you know first and foremost the the
 
01:54:56.709 --> 01:54:56.719 align:start position:0%
health insurance component what you
 
01:54:59.270 --> 01:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
would think of the Medicaid Program and
 
01:55:00.950 --> 01:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
then to support the rest of the
 
01:55:03.709 --> 01:55:03.719 align:start position:0%
department in um their interactions with
 
01:55:07.470 --> 01:55:07.480 align:start position:0%
CMS to get exceptions U to provide
 
01:55:10.629 --> 01:55:10.639 align:start position:0%
certain Services um or waivers to
 
01:55:12.709 --> 01:55:12.719 align:start position:0%
provide certain Services as well as the
 
01:55:15.750 --> 01:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
financing component and the financing
 
01:55:19.870 --> 01:55:19.880 align:start position:0%
component um is not all us either we um
 
01:55:22.430 --> 01:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
interact with u Nathan's team and in
 
01:55:25.030 --> 01:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
terms of the federal claiming um if you
 
01:55:28.350 --> 01:55:28.360 align:start position:0%
will we're sort of the the policy
 
01:55:31.149 --> 01:55:31.159 align:start position:0%
expertise and
 
01:55:33.990 --> 01:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
financing understanding and the actual
 
01:55:36.030 --> 01:55:36.040 align:start position:0%
making sure that we do it right and
 
01:55:38.270 --> 01:55:38.280 align:start position:0%
claiming is really under Nathan's group
 
01:55:41.910 --> 01:55:41.920 align:start position:0%
and managing portions of of this chart
 
01:55:44.310 --> 01:55:44.320 align:start position:0%
go to different programers like kacha
 
01:55:47.870 --> 01:55:47.880 align:start position:0%
Fox's division would be um one uh the
 
01:55:50.750 --> 01:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
the DD waiver you know is uh Melissa
 
01:55:53.310 --> 01:55:53.320 align:start position:0%
Hardy um over sees you know that
 
01:55:55.709 --> 01:55:55.719 align:start position:0%
division so this gives you a picture of
 
01:55:58.669 --> 01:55:58.679 align:start position:0%
everything we have um and kind of what I
 
01:56:01.069 --> 01:56:01.079 align:start position:0%
have to have a certain my division has
 
01:56:03.109 --> 01:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
to have a certain level of interaction
 
01:56:04.870 --> 01:56:04.880 align:start position:0%
with but we don't control everything
 
01:56:07.669 --> 01:56:07.679 align:start position:0%
that happens in these spaces but when
 
01:56:09.910 --> 01:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
when CMS has an issue they look to the
 
01:56:11.550 --> 01:56:11.560 align:start position:0%
Medicaid director as a single point of
 
01:56:15.350 --> 01:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
contact to the state and um it's really
 
01:56:17.350 --> 01:56:17.360 align:start position:0%
a partnership and working with other
 
01:56:20.109 --> 01:56:20.119 align:start position:0%
parts of the department um and you know
 
01:56:22.589 --> 01:56:22.599 align:start position:0%
trying to meet needs and and when needs
 
01:56:24.990 --> 01:56:25.000 align:start position:0%
are for particular populations are are
 
01:56:27.510 --> 01:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
special that's where these um Pieces
 
01:56:30.310 --> 01:56:30.320 align:start position:0%
come into play representative priest for
 
01:56:33.229 --> 01:56:33.239 align:start position:0%
a question followed by representative
 
01:56:36.189 --> 01:56:36.199 align:start position:0%
walner thank you Madame Vice chairman
 
01:56:40.550 --> 01:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
back on page nine the last item on
 
01:56:43.910 --> 01:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
waivers 1135 disaster
 
01:56:48.390 --> 01:56:48.400 align:start position:0%
waivers it came into existence in 2020 I
 
01:56:51.270 --> 01:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
mean I'm sorry 2020 and it ended in 23
 
01:56:52.790 --> 01:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
can you give us just some
 
01:56:52.800 --> 01:56:53.589 align:start position:0%
can you give us just some
a

01:56:53.589 --> 01:56:53.599 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:56:57.830 --> 01:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
brief sure what that was so at at the
 
01:57:01.510 --> 01:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
very beginning like March of 2020 um you
 
01:57:02.669 --> 01:57:02.679 align:start position:0%
know there were concerns that our
 
01:57:04.709 --> 01:57:04.719 align:start position:0%
hospitals were going to get overrun okay
 
01:57:08.470 --> 01:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
um we were it was a permission to um be
 
01:57:11.950 --> 01:57:11.960 align:start position:0%
able to work outside of normal um
 
01:57:14.030 --> 01:57:14.040 align:start position:0%
conditions and meeting like you know if
 
01:57:16.350 --> 01:57:16.360 align:start position:0%
we were going to use an Armory to or to
 
01:57:19.430 --> 01:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
to be able to do testing outside of the
 
01:57:21.350 --> 01:57:21.360 align:start position:0%
conventional means it was basically
 
01:57:23.669 --> 01:57:23.679 align:start position:0%
those things that could get
 
01:57:25.270 --> 01:57:25.280 align:start position:0%
flexibilities and still receive a
 
01:57:28.030 --> 01:57:28.040 align:start position:0%
Medicaid match um that didn't comply
 
01:57:32.229 --> 01:57:32.239 align:start position:0%
with with what would be normal times um
 
01:57:34.589 --> 01:57:34.599 align:start position:0%
that's why it's called a disaster waiver
 
01:57:36.390 --> 01:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
you know states that have hurricanes and
 
01:57:38.669 --> 01:57:38.679 align:start position:0%
tornadoes deal with this all the time
 
01:57:40.149 --> 01:57:40.159 align:start position:0%
this is the only one I've dealt with in
 
01:57:42.470 --> 01:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
my tenure hopefully it'll be the only
 
01:57:45.270 --> 01:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
one that yeah so you have a kind of a
 
01:57:48.510 --> 01:57:48.520 align:start position:0%
plan in place for this and even though
 
01:57:52.229 --> 01:57:52.239 align:start position:0%
it's not being utilized now it could be
 
01:57:55.870 --> 01:57:55.880 align:start position:0%
utilize if we have something like the
 
01:58:00.270 --> 01:58:00.280 align:start position:0%
sea sea levels Rising on the coast and
 
01:58:02.430 --> 01:58:02.440 align:start position:0%
at our communities yeah so we would have
 
01:58:04.510 --> 01:58:04.520 align:start position:0%
to go back and there are different
 
01:58:06.750 --> 01:58:06.760 align:start position:0%
specific authorities you can ask for um
 
01:58:09.510 --> 01:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
like the think of the wildfires that
 
01:58:11.830 --> 01:58:11.840 align:start position:0%
were in California like some of the
 
01:58:13.669 --> 01:58:13.679 align:start position:0%
hospitals that were maybe destroyed in
 
01:58:15.709 --> 01:58:15.719 align:start position:0%
that or other healthare facilities you
 
01:58:18.830 --> 01:58:18.840 align:start position:0%
know may sometimes you have a a region
 
01:58:21.149 --> 01:58:21.159 align:start position:0%
but this one was a Statewide kind of
 
01:58:23.990 --> 01:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
situation um um but basically we have a
 
01:58:26.870 --> 01:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
a contact at CMS that says you know we
 
01:58:30.990 --> 01:58:31.000 align:start position:0%
can reach out to and um get special
 
01:58:32.870 --> 01:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
exceptions to things that ordinarily
 
01:58:34.030 --> 01:58:34.040 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't pay for because they're
 
01:58:37.030 --> 01:58:37.040 align:start position:0%
not delivered in the standard way okay
 
01:58:37.040 --> 01:58:40.310 align:start position:0%
not delivered in the standard way okay
thank

01:58:40.310 --> 01:58:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:44.390 --> 01:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
you thank you um so most of these have
 
01:58:47.270 --> 01:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
ending dates on them yes what happens
 
01:58:49.470 --> 01:58:49.480 align:start position:0%
when we come to the end or get close to
 
01:58:52.510 --> 01:58:52.520 align:start position:0%
the end do you need to reapply yes um
 
01:58:57.350 --> 01:58:57.360 align:start position:0%
like we for example in the sud SMI 1115
 
01:59:01.030 --> 01:59:01.040 align:start position:0%
waiver um we we applied for an extension
 
01:59:02.990 --> 01:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
because it would otherwise have ended
 
01:59:05.950 --> 01:59:05.960 align:start position:0%
and so um we had to make application so
 
01:59:08.790 --> 01:59:08.800 align:start position:0%
for um each of these wavers there's
 
01:59:11.030 --> 01:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
probably been a renewal particularly if
 
01:59:12.470 --> 01:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
you look at some of the dates that go
 
01:59:15.629 --> 01:59:15.639 align:start position:0%
back um like the DD waiver you know
 
01:59:19.589 --> 01:59:19.599 align:start position:0%
originated in 1987 which is on page um
 
01:59:22.470 --> 01:59:22.480 align:start position:0%
eight um the second one from the bottom
 
01:59:24.189 --> 01:59:24.199 align:start position:0%
and the choices for Independence waiver
 
01:59:27.589 --> 01:59:27.599 align:start position:0%
was 1984 so either typically they're
 
01:59:31.750 --> 01:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
either two or fiveyear renewals um and
 
01:59:34.750 --> 01:59:34.760 align:start position:0%
uh sometimes you need an amendment uh to
 
01:59:36.790 --> 01:59:36.800 align:start position:0%
a waiver if something is changing in
 
01:59:38.790 --> 01:59:38.800 align:start position:0%
them like you know I think there's
 
01:59:40.589 --> 01:59:40.599 align:start position:0%
discussion out there about you know
 
01:59:43.589 --> 01:59:43.599 align:start position:0%
criteria for CFI that you know if you
 
01:59:46.470 --> 01:59:46.480 align:start position:0%
make certain eligibility changes um you
 
01:59:48.310 --> 01:59:48.320 align:start position:0%
just can't do that c blanch you have to
 
01:59:56.390 --> 01:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:59.149 --> 01:59:59.159 align:start position:0%
um well I guess the last informational
 
02:00:02.109 --> 02:00:02.119 align:start position:0%
thing was um the last two informational
 
02:00:05.390 --> 02:00:05.400 align:start position:0%
things here um there was a question
 
02:00:08.430 --> 02:00:08.440 align:start position:0%
about how our Dental rates compare um on
 
02:00:11.870 --> 02:00:11.880 align:start position:0%
page 11 um I think the third bullet is
 
02:00:15.069 --> 02:00:15.079 align:start position:0%
kind of what I would focus in on is that
 
02:00:16.910 --> 02:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
um when we did this study with our
 
02:00:18.069 --> 02:00:18.079 align:start position:0%
actuary in
 
02:00:21.950 --> 02:00:21.960 align:start position:0%
2023 that uh our Medicaid fees were 76%
 
02:00:25.030 --> 02:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
% of the commercial allowed charges as
 
02:00:26.430 --> 02:00:26.440 align:start position:0%
opposed to if you looked at build
 
02:00:30.669 --> 02:00:30.679 align:start position:0%
charges they're 46% of the build charges
 
02:00:32.910 --> 02:00:32.920 align:start position:0%
um you know there's typically you'll see
 
02:00:35.390 --> 02:00:35.400 align:start position:0%
in hospital bills and and other provider
 
02:00:37.350 --> 02:00:37.360 align:start position:0%
bills that the bill charges are often
 
02:00:40.950 --> 02:00:40.960 align:start position:0%
higher than the allowed charges and so
 
02:00:42.350 --> 02:00:42.360 align:start position:0%
we measured ourselves in a couple
 
02:00:44.390 --> 02:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
different ways
 
02:00:46.990 --> 02:00:47.000 align:start position:0%
um that's really just informational I'm
 
02:00:48.790 --> 02:00:48.800 align:start position:0%
not I don't remember who had this
 
02:00:51.390 --> 02:00:51.400 align:start position:0%
specific question but there's any more
 
02:00:51.400 --> 02:00:52.709 align:start position:0%
specific question but there's any more
detail

02:00:52.709 --> 02:00:52.719 align:start position:0%
detail
 
02:00:56.669 --> 02:00:56.679 align:start position:0%
need now moving back to um some forms of
 
02:00:58.790 --> 02:00:58.800 align:start position:0%
Eligibility this I think relates to a
 
02:01:00.430 --> 02:01:00.440 align:start position:0%
question that came up earlier like what
 
02:01:03.470 --> 02:01:03.480 align:start position:0%
is the current enrollment um in Medicaid
 
02:01:07.550 --> 02:01:07.560 align:start position:0%
as of March 3rd um a point in time
 
02:01:10.270 --> 02:01:10.280 align:start position:0%
enrollment measurement um our granted
 
02:01:13.550 --> 02:01:13.560 align:start position:0%
Advantage Programs at 59
 
02:01:13.560 --> 02:01:15.069 align:start position:0%
Advantage Programs at 59
895

02:01:15.069 --> 02:01:15.079 align:start position:0%
895
 
02:01:18.790 --> 02:01:18.800 align:start position:0%
um you know we're about 8,500 more than
 
02:01:21.310 --> 02:01:21.320 align:start position:0%
we were back in March of 2020 I think I
 
02:01:22.709 --> 02:01:22.719 align:start position:0%
shared some of the
 
02:01:27.109 --> 02:01:27.119 align:start position:0%
reasons um for that um the standard
 
02:01:30.350 --> 02:01:30.360 align:start position:0%
program is within 811 of where we were
 
02:01:33.350 --> 02:01:33.360 align:start position:0%
in March of 2020 um so that's pretty
 
02:01:35.510 --> 02:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
close to where we were then and then you
 
02:01:38.830 --> 02:01:38.840 align:start position:0%
know the total enrollment is about 4.4%
 
02:01:42.350 --> 02:01:42.360 align:start position:0%
higher than we were in March of 2020 in
 
02:01:44.709 --> 02:01:44.719 align:start position:0%
part if you look at continuous coverage
 
02:01:48.069 --> 02:01:48.079 align:start position:0%
for children continuous coverage for um
 
02:01:50.950 --> 02:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
pregnant women um you know part of that
 
02:01:53.910 --> 02:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
is built into that but we're we're
 
02:01:56.790 --> 02:01:56.800 align:start position:0%
largely back uh if you look at the chart
 
02:01:59.430 --> 02:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
below the the numbers that are on the
 
02:02:01.910 --> 02:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
far left by eligibility group is what we
 
02:02:03.830 --> 02:02:03.840 align:start position:0%
were at
 
02:02:06.870 --> 02:02:06.880 align:start position:0%
177,00 if you look at the grand total in
 
02:02:11.790 --> 02:02:11.800 align:start position:0%
March of 2020 today um we're at 185
 
02:02:14.669 --> 02:02:14.679 align:start position:0%
139 and you can see how the various
 
02:02:18.990 --> 02:02:19.000 align:start position:0%
eligibility groups um have uh grown or
 
02:02:22.229 --> 02:02:22.239 align:start position:0%
or not um over time compared to
 
02:02:25.149 --> 02:02:25.159 align:start position:0%
different um the the percent change
 
02:02:29.550 --> 02:02:29.560 align:start position:0%
since um 2020 March of 2020 or you can
 
02:02:31.910 --> 02:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
look at the percent change to the far
 
02:02:33.750 --> 02:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
right from the end of the federal Public
 
02:02:35.430 --> 02:02:35.440 align:start position:0%
Health Emergency where we started the
 
02:02:35.440 --> 02:02:39.950 align:start position:0%
Health Emergency where we started the
unwind

02:02:39.950 --> 02:02:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:44.550 --> 02:02:44.560 align:start position:0%
um then on page uh 13 this is something
 
02:02:47.430 --> 02:02:47.440 align:start position:0%
I um sorry sorry representative tarki
 
02:02:50.030 --> 02:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
for a question where up above in the
 
02:02:52.950 --> 02:02:52.960 align:start position:0%
adult groups is the um um postpartum
 
02:02:54.750 --> 02:02:54.760 align:start position:0%
extension to 12 months so those
 
02:02:57.390 --> 02:02:57.400 align:start position:0%
non-disabled adults so that would be
 
02:02:59.430 --> 02:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
some of them are are in the adult
 
02:03:01.589 --> 02:03:01.599 align:start position:0%
expansion group um that's where they
 
02:03:06.069 --> 02:03:06.079 align:start position:0%
begin um and they could be in in um they
 
02:03:08.990 --> 02:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
could be in the other
 
02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:13.310 align:start position:0%
could be in the other
uh

02:03:13.310 --> 02:03:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:17.629 --> 02:03:17.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:20.629 --> 02:03:20.639 align:start position:0%
um other non-disabled adults those those
 
02:03:22.550 --> 02:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
are probably be the two
 
02:03:24.189 --> 02:03:24.199 align:start position:0%
places that we would find them I think
 
02:03:27.430 --> 02:03:27.440 align:start position:0%
the the um the federal benefit of
 
02:03:29.109 --> 02:03:29.119 align:start position:0%
providing an enhanced Federal match on
 
02:03:34.390 --> 02:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
them a lot of them would either um be
 
02:03:35.629 --> 02:03:35.639 align:start position:0%
like they would have been in granted
 
02:03:37.629 --> 02:03:37.639 align:start position:0%
Advantage they got pregnant as an
 
02:03:40.470 --> 02:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
example they otherwise after their
 
02:03:43.069 --> 02:03:43.079 align:start position:0%
pregnancy would only have the 60 days of
 
02:03:46.390 --> 02:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
coverage now they have 12 months we if
 
02:03:48.149 --> 02:03:48.159 align:start position:0%
you interested in more detail on that I
 
02:03:50.750 --> 02:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
can um give you some follow no I'm just
 
02:03:53.149 --> 02:03:53.159 align:start position:0%
trying to connect the dots between you
 
02:03:58.189 --> 02:03:58.199 align:start position:0%
know that sliver of of the population
 
02:04:01.990 --> 02:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
that got the extended care and the num
 
02:04:03.870 --> 02:04:03.880 align:start position:0%
the bottom line numbers of how many
 
02:04:06.149 --> 02:04:06.159 align:start position:0%
people are being served and so where
 
02:04:08.390 --> 02:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
that growth came so I think in terms of
 
02:04:10.109 --> 02:04:10.119 align:start position:0%
the the granted Advantage we're talking
 
02:04:11.790 --> 02:04:11.800 align:start position:0%
about hundreds not thousands that's what
 
02:04:14.270 --> 02:04:14.280 align:start position:0%
I thought yeah small yeah it's probably
 
02:04:18.310 --> 02:04:18.320 align:start position:0%
under well under a thousand well
 
02:04:21.149 --> 02:04:21.159 align:start position:0%
okay can I ask one more question digging
 
02:04:22.510 --> 02:04:22.520 align:start position:0%
into the children children's numbers a
 
02:04:26.549 --> 02:04:26.559 align:start position:0%
little bit yes um the can you speak to
 
02:04:28.750 --> 02:04:28.760 align:start position:0%
the increase of
 
02:04:33.589 --> 02:04:33.599 align:start position:0%
26.6% in um chip kids and and what's
 
02:04:35.790 --> 02:04:35.800 align:start position:0%
behind that sort of significant increase
 
02:04:38.270 --> 02:04:38.280 align:start position:0%
yeah in terms of
 
02:04:41.109 --> 02:04:41.119 align:start position:0%
um I think
 
02:04:44.030 --> 02:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
the the economic circumstances of the
 
02:04:47.589 --> 02:04:47.599 align:start position:0%
state that you know when you look at
 
02:04:51.189 --> 02:04:51.199 align:start position:0%
um U the the eligibility for chip Right
 
02:04:53.430 --> 02:04:53.440 align:start position:0%
In terms of the the federal poverty
 
02:04:55.589 --> 02:04:55.599 align:start position:0%
limit to which gets them into that level
 
02:04:58.510 --> 02:04:58.520 align:start position:0%
I think you know New Hampshire has one
 
02:05:01.270 --> 02:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
of the lowest poverty levels and while
 
02:05:03.270 --> 02:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
we have poverty and people in severe
 
02:05:06.350 --> 02:05:06.360 align:start position:0%
poverty I think in terms of generally
 
02:05:09.709 --> 02:05:09.719 align:start position:0%
our our communities are doing better
 
02:05:11.950 --> 02:05:11.960 align:start position:0%
than than National comparisons and I
 
02:05:14.470 --> 02:05:14.480 align:start position:0%
think what has happened is we've seen M
 
02:05:18.229 --> 02:05:18.239 align:start position:0%
some migration because of increased with
 
02:05:19.950 --> 02:05:19.960 align:start position:0%
the labor shortage some of the increased
 
02:05:21.870 --> 02:05:21.880 align:start position:0%
wages that have happened you know people
 
02:05:24.430 --> 02:05:24.440 align:start position:0%
who were maybe you
 
02:05:27.109 --> 02:05:27.119 align:start position:0%
know some of the basic jobs now required
 
02:05:29.830 --> 02:05:29.840 align:start position:0%
paying $15 an hour or more that I think
 
02:05:32.390 --> 02:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
we've seen some of the individuals who
 
02:05:35.709 --> 02:05:35.719 align:start position:0%
qualify for children have been pushed up
 
02:05:38.629 --> 02:05:38.639 align:start position:0%
as wages have improved in the state that
 
02:05:43.149 --> 02:05:43.159 align:start position:0%
that's my that's my theory on it um that
 
02:05:45.709 --> 02:05:45.719 align:start position:0%
so we haven't necessarily expanded
 
02:05:47.750 --> 02:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
coverage for children no that would
 
02:05:51.950 --> 02:05:51.960 align:start position:0%
translate to a one qu% increase the the
 
02:05:53.830 --> 02:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
only expansion we did was how long we
 
02:05:56.069 --> 02:05:56.079 align:start position:0%
covered them for which is 12 months
 
02:06:00.589 --> 02:06:00.599 align:start position:0%
starting in January 2024 um 12 months of
 
02:06:03.149 --> 02:06:03.159 align:start position:0%
continuous cover so my conclusion to
 
02:06:05.669 --> 02:06:05.679 align:start position:0%
that is we just have more kids living in
 
02:06:09.750 --> 02:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
poverty in the state um I think
 
02:06:12.310 --> 02:06:12.320 align:start position:0%
actually we have some statistics on that
 
02:06:14.750 --> 02:06:14.760 align:start position:0%
we could probably provide to you I think
 
02:06:18.310 --> 02:06:18.320 align:start position:0%
when um trying to remember here if we
 
02:06:20.069 --> 02:06:20.079 align:start position:0%
one of your questions and I think if we
 
02:06:24.589 --> 02:06:24.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:27.589 --> 02:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
um David I think it's the last slide
 
02:06:27.599 --> 02:06:34.510 align:start position:0%
um David I think it's the last slide
right

02:06:34.510 --> 02:06:34.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:41.109 --> 02:06:41.119 align:start position:0%
yeah so this is um some statistics on um
 
02:06:44.430 --> 02:06:44.440 align:start position:0%
looking over time um the uninsurance
 
02:06:47.669 --> 02:06:47.679 align:start position:0%
rate with children and poverty levels I
 
02:06:50.229 --> 02:06:50.239 align:start position:0%
think one of the question was to us was
 
02:06:57.470 --> 02:06:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:59.830 --> 02:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
um U you know what we've seen in terms
 
02:07:01.709 --> 02:07:01.719 align:start position:0%
of the three bullets on the far right
 
02:07:04.189 --> 02:07:04.199 align:start position:0%
hand side conclusions this is the very
 
02:07:09.589 --> 02:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:13.790 --> 02:07:13.800 align:start position:0%
handout so we've seen the the lowest
 
02:07:17.109 --> 02:07:17.119 align:start position:0%
income children that we've seen a a 91
 
02:07:19.990 --> 02:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
um has decreased 91% over the last 10
 
02:07:23.229 --> 02:07:23.239 align:start position:0%
years in terms of their uninsurance rate
 
02:07:26.510 --> 02:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
um then another question that we had was
 
02:07:26.520 --> 02:07:27.390 align:start position:0%
um then another question that we had was
for

02:07:27.390 --> 02:07:27.400 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:07:33.629 --> 02:07:33.639 align:start position:0%
the um children that are potentially um
 
02:07:36.109 --> 02:07:36.119 align:start position:0%
could meet the eligibility criteria um
 
02:07:39.270 --> 02:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
who aren't currently enrolled we um
 
02:07:44.229 --> 02:07:44.239 align:start position:0%
we the demographer Mr got uh PhD got Le
 
02:07:46.030 --> 02:07:46.040 align:start position:0%
who does Consulting for the state helped
 
02:07:48.990 --> 02:07:49.000 align:start position:0%
us with this information here um
 
02:07:52.189 --> 02:07:52.199 align:start position:0%
there're about 11,500 kids one of the
 
02:07:54.910 --> 02:07:54.920 align:start position:0%
things that um my deputy director
 
02:07:58.390 --> 02:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
reminded me this morning is that for
 
02:08:01.910 --> 02:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
families who um have a choice of
 
02:08:05.390 --> 02:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
Medicaid or um potentially ACA coverage
 
02:08:08.069 --> 02:08:08.079 align:start position:0%
for the family there are instances where
 
02:08:11.270 --> 02:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
um that the subsidies that are available
 
02:08:13.470 --> 02:08:13.480 align:start position:0%
it makes sense that not when you look at
 
02:08:15.229 --> 02:08:15.239 align:start position:0%
a single child but on a whole family
 
02:08:18.950 --> 02:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
level um to to choose ACA coverage over
 
02:08:21.830 --> 02:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
Medicaid so I can't tell you how many
 
02:08:24.549 --> 02:08:24.559 align:start position:0%
people are in that world but there are
 
02:08:26.990 --> 02:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
instances where when you look at from a
 
02:08:28.629 --> 02:08:28.639 align:start position:0%
family perspective if everybody's going
 
02:08:31.950 --> 02:08:31.960 align:start position:0%
to need um a certain type of coverage
 
02:08:33.510 --> 02:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
particularly ACA coverage that they may
 
02:08:37.950 --> 02:08:37.960 align:start position:0%
not choose to go on Medicaid um because
 
02:08:39.950 --> 02:08:39.960 align:start position:0%
on a whole economic basis for the family
 
02:08:43.709 --> 02:08:43.719 align:start position:0%
it's cheaper for them to go that way um
 
02:08:45.470 --> 02:08:45.480 align:start position:0%
and then
 
02:08:49.830 --> 02:08:49.840 align:start position:0%
um the last bullet
 
02:08:53.589 --> 02:08:53.599 align:start position:0%
um that uh sort of I guess ties to this
 
02:08:56.750 --> 02:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
there approximately um you know 86,500
 
02:09:00.270 --> 02:09:00.280 align:start position:0%
kids enrolled in the Medicaid and and um
 
02:09:03.149 --> 02:09:03.159 align:start position:0%
98,000 kids in New Hampshire who are at
 
02:09:05.870 --> 02:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
or below in families of 323 per of
 
02:09:08.950 --> 02:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
poverty so we do cover a pretty large
 
02:09:11.229 --> 02:09:11.239 align:start position:0%
percentage of the what what are the
 
02:09:13.910 --> 02:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
potentially eligible um you know we have
 
02:09:17.270 --> 02:09:17.280 align:start position:0%
the fifth highest eligibility level at
 
02:09:21.790 --> 02:09:21.800 align:start position:0%
um 323 they're you know um about half
 
02:09:25.510 --> 02:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
the states stop at 25% or less of
 
02:09:27.950 --> 02:09:27.960 align:start position:0%
poverty um you know New Hampshire has
 
02:09:30.910 --> 02:09:30.920 align:start position:0%
had a long history of providing um I
 
02:09:33.790 --> 02:09:33.800 align:start position:0%
think higher eligibility for children um
 
02:09:35.750 --> 02:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
I think if you go way back to the New
 
02:09:37.510 --> 02:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Healthy Kids standpoint there
 
02:09:40.270 --> 02:09:40.280 align:start position:0%
we were at 300% of poverty at the time
 
02:09:43.669 --> 02:09:43.679 align:start position:0%
um so I think you know when you look at
 
02:09:46.189 --> 02:09:46.199 align:start position:0%
you know long-term costs for State you
 
02:09:47.589 --> 02:09:47.599 align:start position:0%
know taking care of
 
02:09:50.430 --> 02:09:50.440 align:start position:0%
children typically less expensive than
 
02:09:51.790 --> 02:09:51.800 align:start position:0%
than adults if you do the right
 
02:09:54.990 --> 02:09:55.000 align:start position:0%
preventative Services um in the long run
 
02:09:59.069 --> 02:09:59.079 align:start position:0%
I think you you have lower costs and um
 
02:10:02.109 --> 02:10:02.119 align:start position:0%
you know we're among the not to say we
 
02:10:04.390 --> 02:10:04.400 align:start position:0%
don't have our issues as a state but we
 
02:10:06.310 --> 02:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
rank in the usually in the top five or
 
02:10:08.270 --> 02:10:08.280 align:start position:0%
better in terms of you know health
 
02:10:10.669 --> 02:10:10.679 align:start position:0%
status of our population and you know I
 
02:10:12.270 --> 02:10:12.280 align:start position:0%
think we get pretty high marks overall
 
02:10:14.390 --> 02:10:14.400 align:start position:0%
on our children again that's not to say
 
02:10:15.830 --> 02:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
that there aren't pockets of areas that
 
02:10:17.950 --> 02:10:17.960 align:start position:0%
we still need to work on but I think
 
02:10:19.870 --> 02:10:19.880 align:start position:0%
that's something you could be proud of
 
02:10:23.430 --> 02:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
as a legislature and us as Medicaid unit
 
02:10:26.069 --> 02:10:26.079 align:start position:0%
that um I think we're doing a lot of
 
02:10:28.470 --> 02:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
good work um with children and as is the
 
02:10:29.470 --> 02:10:29.480 align:start position:0%
rest of the Department of Health and
 
02:10:32.310 --> 02:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
Human Services No Doubt thank you for
 
02:10:39.390 --> 02:10:39.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:41.910 --> 02:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
sure I just there's two things I would
 
02:10:43.910 --> 02:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
like to point out and I know I want to
 
02:10:46.069 --> 02:10:46.079 align:start position:0%
save as much time for hb2 as we could
 
02:10:52.149 --> 02:10:52.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:54.549 --> 02:10:54.559 align:start position:0%
13 I have an ey appointment next week
 
02:10:58.510 --> 02:10:58.520 align:start position:0%
for new glasses so definitely need them
 
02:11:00.830 --> 02:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that we started to
 
02:11:02.270 --> 02:11:02.280 align:start position:0%
do during the federal Public Health
 
02:11:06.990 --> 02:11:07.000 align:start position:0%
Emergency was we started to do Outreach
 
02:11:09.149 --> 02:11:09.159 align:start position:0%
directly through the
 
02:11:11.470 --> 02:11:11.480 align:start position:0%
department and through our
 
02:11:14.310 --> 02:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
mcos um during the continuous coverage
 
02:11:17.310 --> 02:11:17.320 align:start position:0%
period to say do you still need
 
02:11:19.750 --> 02:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
Medicaid are you still a resident of the
 
02:11:23.549 --> 02:11:23.559 align:start position:0%
state and just in the past year um by
 
02:11:26.549 --> 02:11:26.559 align:start position:0%
doing that survey work um both through
 
02:11:30.069 --> 02:11:30.079 align:start position:0%
the mcos and the department that um
 
02:11:34.790 --> 02:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
people who um who you know when
 
02:11:36.870 --> 02:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
contacted um and said do you still need
 
02:11:39.069 --> 02:11:39.079 align:start position:0%
the coverage you know there were almost
 
02:11:41.189 --> 02:11:41.199 align:start position:0%
6,000 individuals who told
 
02:11:45.229 --> 02:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
us they don't need it anymore um there
 
02:11:48.069 --> 02:11:48.079 align:start position:0%
are people who move out of New Hampshire
 
02:11:50.870 --> 02:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
um you know we look at death records to
 
02:11:52.189 --> 02:11:52.199 align:start position:0%
make sure we're not covering people who
 
02:11:55.149 --> 02:11:55.159 align:start position:0%
aren't living um and then you know
 
02:11:56.990 --> 02:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
there's other people who are are not
 
02:11:58.990 --> 02:11:59.000 align:start position:0%
requesting it any further so I'm just
 
02:12:01.870 --> 02:12:01.880 align:start position:0%
saying in a one-year period in terms of
 
02:12:04.629 --> 02:12:04.639 align:start position:0%
making sure that we're not paying for
 
02:12:06.990 --> 02:12:07.000 align:start position:0%
people who don't need the coverage or
 
02:12:09.229 --> 02:12:09.239 align:start position:0%
are no longer eligible in state that
 
02:12:11.109 --> 02:12:11.119 align:start position:0%
we're this is something that we weren't
 
02:12:12.950 --> 02:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
doing pre- pandemic this is something
 
02:12:15.069 --> 02:12:15.079 align:start position:0%
that we started during the pandemic and
 
02:12:18.149 --> 02:12:18.159 align:start position:0%
are continuing um if I went back the
 
02:12:20.430 --> 02:12:20.440 align:start position:0%
year before the number over the year
 
02:12:22.390 --> 02:12:22.400 align:start position:0%
year period that we had done that as
 
02:12:24.149 --> 02:12:24.159 align:start position:0%
well what I'm trying to say here is I
 
02:12:25.830 --> 02:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
think we're trying to be conscientious
 
02:12:28.310 --> 02:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
about not paying for
 
02:12:30.629 --> 02:12:30.639 align:start position:0%
services and using dollars where they're
 
02:12:33.510 --> 02:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
not needed um because I know that
 
02:12:35.709 --> 02:12:35.719 align:start position:0%
dollars are are are precious
 
02:12:37.709 --> 02:12:37.719 align:start position:0%
particularly this this budget that we're
 
02:12:40.189 --> 02:12:40.199 align:start position:0%
continuing to do this work and intend to
 
02:12:42.270 --> 02:12:42.280 align:start position:0%
to continue to do it and I just sort of
 
02:12:44.790 --> 02:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
proud of that that we're doing that very
 
02:12:47.470 --> 02:12:47.480 align:start position:0%
important thank you for the slide the
 
02:12:50.350 --> 02:12:50.360 align:start position:0%
the next two slides kind of go together
 
02:12:54.589 --> 02:12:54.599 align:start position:0%
um the the one with the bar graph uh
 
02:12:59.350 --> 02:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
page 14 is the expart rate um what expar
 
02:13:02.629 --> 02:13:02.639 align:start position:0%
means is that the department has enough
 
02:13:06.069 --> 02:13:06.079 align:start position:0%
information to renew someone without um
 
02:13:08.990 --> 02:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
an individual like we have access to um
 
02:13:11.470 --> 02:13:11.480 align:start position:0%
income records or asset records or so
 
02:13:13.990 --> 02:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
forth that during the federal Public
 
02:13:16.430 --> 02:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
Health Emergency and the unwind
 
02:13:19.709 --> 02:13:19.719 align:start position:0%
period there were special
 
02:13:22.030 --> 02:13:22.040 align:start position:0%
um um
 
02:13:23.950 --> 02:13:23.960 align:start position:0%
flexibilities that states were given to
 
02:13:26.910 --> 02:13:26.920 align:start position:0%
deal with the huge backload backlog of
 
02:13:29.149 --> 02:13:29.159 align:start position:0%
redeterminations we had while we got
 
02:13:31.950 --> 02:13:31.960 align:start position:0%
30,000 done during the public health
 
02:13:34.910 --> 02:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
emergency there were 230,000 to catch up
 
02:13:40.709 --> 02:13:40.719 align:start position:0%
on um so um we you know a lot of these
 
02:13:43.990 --> 02:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
flexibilities were intended to make sure
 
02:13:46.310 --> 02:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
that particularly in the the elderly the
 
02:13:49.270 --> 02:13:49.280 align:start position:0%
home and commit based people that where
 
02:13:51.790 --> 02:13:51.800 align:start position:0%
there's um you have to Prov paperwork
 
02:13:53.510 --> 02:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
that there are periods of where some
 
02:13:55.510 --> 02:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
people who became on Medicaid never had
 
02:13:57.430 --> 02:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
to do a redetermination then you had
 
02:13:59.310 --> 02:13:59.320 align:start position:0%
people that you know during the public
 
02:14:01.549 --> 02:14:01.559 align:start position:0%
health emergency may not have kept up
 
02:14:02.790 --> 02:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
with their financial records because
 
02:14:03.910 --> 02:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
they didn't need to because they didn't
 
02:14:11.149 --> 02:14:11.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:13.629 --> 02:14:13.639 align:start position:0%
redetermining end
 
02:14:21.470 --> 02:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
um June 30th and so page 15 is a chart
 
02:14:26.470 --> 02:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
um that um is just an example of the
 
02:14:28.910 --> 02:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
month of March of 2025 I'm going to jump
 
02:14:30.790 --> 02:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
down to the bottom give you the the
 
02:14:33.830 --> 02:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
punchline for you know to save time here
 
02:14:37.549 --> 02:14:37.559 align:start position:0%
but by those flexibilities going away
 
02:14:39.510 --> 02:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
there are TW over
 
02:14:43.709 --> 02:14:43.719 align:start position:0%
2500 um cases and over 3,000 individuals
 
02:14:45.390 --> 02:14:45.400 align:start position:0%
that would have gone
 
02:14:49.470 --> 02:14:49.480 align:start position:0%
expart um who won't and I'm you know the
 
02:14:52.229 --> 02:14:52.239 align:start position:0%
reason I bring up this concern is not is
 
02:14:54.750 --> 02:14:54.760 align:start position:0%
in terms of as you look at the the
 
02:14:57.310 --> 02:14:57.320 align:start position:0%
eligibility area Karen Hebert's unit in
 
02:14:59.950 --> 02:14:59.960 align:start position:0%
particular in terms of the the Staffing
 
02:15:03.990 --> 02:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
that she has available um the the the
 
02:15:08.149 --> 02:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
resources for for it and and uh um and
 
02:15:10.830 --> 02:15:10.840 align:start position:0%
such that and call center that we're
 
02:15:12.629 --> 02:15:12.639 align:start position:0%
going to get a lot more calls we're
 
02:15:14.669 --> 02:15:14.679 align:start position:0%
going to get um have to do a lot more
 
02:15:16.990 --> 02:15:17.000 align:start position:0%
case workk than we than we've been doing
 
02:15:20.189 --> 02:15:20.199 align:start position:0%
and I'm just concerned that we provide
 
02:15:24.270 --> 02:15:24.280 align:start position:0%
good service to um to making people
 
02:15:27.549 --> 02:15:27.559 align:start position:0%
eligible when they're eligible and um so
 
02:15:29.310 --> 02:15:29.320 align:start position:0%
I think that's just a draw your
 
02:15:30.870 --> 02:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
attention this for two reasons in terms
 
02:15:34.870 --> 02:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
of one you know we are trying to um
 
02:15:36.510 --> 02:15:36.520 align:start position:0%
reduce the roles where where it's
 
02:15:39.549 --> 02:15:39.559 align:start position:0%
appropriate to do so um but that by
 
02:15:42.709 --> 02:15:42.719 align:start position:0%
ending all these flexibilities it's and
 
02:15:45.310 --> 02:15:45.320 align:start position:0%
with a hiring freeze we've got a big
 
02:15:47.790 --> 02:15:47.800 align:start position:0%
challenge ahead of us here that where
 
02:15:49.549 --> 02:15:49.559 align:start position:0%
from a constituent service standpoint
 
02:15:51.589 --> 02:15:51.599 align:start position:0%
you know the number one issue that
 
02:15:55.669 --> 02:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
that I hear about you know our our U
 
02:15:57.549 --> 02:15:57.559 align:start position:0%
eligibility the time it takes to get
 
02:15:59.990 --> 02:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
eligibility um particularly when it's
 
02:16:02.189 --> 02:16:02.199 align:start position:0%
not just an income based eligibility and
 
02:16:04.350 --> 02:16:04.360 align:start position:0%
there are factors that are related to
 
02:16:06.030 --> 02:16:06.040 align:start position:0%
what people can do and produce for their
 
02:16:08.870 --> 02:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
records They have a responsibility to to
 
02:16:11.030 --> 02:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
um to provide information you know if
 
02:16:12.390 --> 02:16:12.400 align:start position:0%
they have a trust we have to get the
 
02:16:15.790 --> 02:16:15.800 align:start position:0%
trust document make sure it qualifies um
 
02:16:17.390 --> 02:16:17.400 align:start position:0%
but this is this is a big issue I think
 
02:16:19.589 --> 02:16:19.599 align:start position:0%
to you know when you think about the
 
02:16:21.510 --> 02:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
type of calls you may get
 
02:16:24.109 --> 02:16:24.119 align:start position:0%
um as legislators in terms of you know
 
02:16:26.270 --> 02:16:26.280 align:start position:0%
I'm not I need the service and I'm not
 
02:16:28.629 --> 02:16:28.639 align:start position:0%
eligible yet this this is my concern for
 
02:16:31.990 --> 02:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
you in this area representative Nano for
 
02:16:34.870 --> 02:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
a question yeah thank you madam chair
 
02:16:38.589 --> 02:16:38.599 align:start position:0%
and thank you mrman um back to uh slide
 
02:16:42.589 --> 02:16:42.599 align:start position:0%
13 yes so I want to make sure I
 
02:16:45.629 --> 02:16:45.639 align:start position:0%
understand this so This the survey or
 
02:16:48.629 --> 02:16:48.639 align:start position:0%
the questions that that you're asking um
 
02:16:53.349 --> 02:16:53.359 align:start position:0%
originate with DHHS and then the um
 
02:16:58.190 --> 02:16:58.200 align:start position:0%
mcos uh administer or solicit responses
 
02:17:01.389 --> 02:17:01.399 align:start position:0%
from the recipient uh pull that the
 
02:17:03.030 --> 02:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
individual MCO
 
02:17:05.549 --> 02:17:05.559 align:start position:0%
manages uh does the
 
02:17:09.230 --> 02:17:09.240 align:start position:0%
MCO uh take it on themselves to report
 
02:17:11.750 --> 02:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
um uh you know people that don't need it
 
02:17:14.870 --> 02:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
anymore or what's the what's the process
 
02:17:17.629 --> 02:17:17.639 align:start position:0%
look like there yeah so we actually I
 
02:17:19.950 --> 02:17:19.960 align:start position:0%
actually could produce a report behind
 
02:17:21.830 --> 02:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
this these numbers these are aggregated
 
02:17:24.030 --> 02:17:24.040 align:start position:0%
by all by we track each month by each
 
02:17:27.910 --> 02:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
MCO the level that that's happening um
 
02:17:30.469 --> 02:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
we also do when we see particularly
 
02:17:32.910 --> 02:17:32.920 align:start position:0%
children when we see children clo we're
 
02:17:36.110 --> 02:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
making outbound calls to families by the
 
02:17:39.549 --> 02:17:39.559 align:start position:0%
mcos to to to make sure that they've
 
02:17:42.190 --> 02:17:42.200 align:start position:0%
gotten the paperwork that they aware of
 
02:17:45.790 --> 02:17:45.800 align:start position:0%
what's going on um and for those that we
 
02:17:50.389 --> 02:17:50.399 align:start position:0%
see that have uh a clinical history or
 
02:17:54.349 --> 02:17:54.359 align:start position:0%
or are you know under treatment and we
 
02:17:56.910 --> 02:17:56.920 align:start position:0%
have our clinical team um within the
 
02:17:59.509 --> 02:17:59.519 align:start position:0%
Medicaid division make outbound calls
 
02:18:01.990 --> 02:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
after the mcos have made their calls to
 
02:18:04.349 --> 02:18:04.359 align:start position:0%
try to make sure that someone
 
02:18:05.950 --> 02:18:05.960 align:start position:0%
particularly children that are
 
02:18:09.549 --> 02:18:09.559 align:start position:0%
closing that we're not that that we've
 
02:18:11.830 --> 02:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
done everything we possibly can do and
 
02:18:13.549 --> 02:18:13.559 align:start position:0%
we're going to redouble our efforts in
 
02:18:16.469 --> 02:18:16.479 align:start position:0%
this area um because you know I still
 
02:18:19.589 --> 02:18:19.599 align:start position:0%
see the closure rate um for people who
 
02:18:21.349 --> 02:18:21.359 align:start position:0%
end up closing particular children is
 
02:18:23.910 --> 02:18:23.920 align:start position:0%
higher than I'd like to see it and um
 
02:18:25.270 --> 02:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
you know I was just talking this morning
 
02:18:27.549 --> 02:18:27.559 align:start position:0%
before we came into this meeting about
 
02:18:31.150 --> 02:18:31.160 align:start position:0%
you know what's let's uh we need to
 
02:18:34.429 --> 02:18:34.439 align:start position:0%
prepare the the Medicaid Community about
 
02:18:38.349 --> 02:18:38.359 align:start position:0%
the the end of the um the the U
 
02:18:41.750 --> 02:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
flexibilities the the that we have that
 
02:18:44.190 --> 02:18:44.200 align:start position:0%
are going to end in June and we need to
 
02:18:46.709 --> 02:18:46.719 align:start position:0%
sort of look at changing our strategies
 
02:18:50.270 --> 02:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
up we've done different things like uh
 
02:18:52.429 --> 02:18:52.439 align:start position:0%
on our noticing to change the color of
 
02:18:54.709 --> 02:18:54.719 align:start position:0%
the paper to try to draw attention and
 
02:18:59.070 --> 02:18:59.080 align:start position:0%
so we've had the yellow paper which was
 
02:19:01.790 --> 02:19:01.800 align:start position:0%
you know caution your your eligibilities
 
02:19:05.950 --> 02:19:05.960 align:start position:0%
coming towards renewal then we had um
 
02:19:08.389 --> 02:19:08.399 align:start position:0%
the pink paper which is like a like a
 
02:19:10.389 --> 02:19:10.399 align:start position:0%
red that you know it's going to close
 
02:19:12.950 --> 02:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
and then we have blue paper that we send
 
02:19:14.910 --> 02:19:14.920 align:start position:0%
out for notices we do both electronic
 
02:19:19.950 --> 02:19:19.960 align:start position:0%
and paper and that saying it it's it's
 
02:19:21.629 --> 02:19:21.639 align:start position:0%
not if it's blue it's not too late to
 
02:19:24.790 --> 02:19:24.800 align:start position:0%
renew meaning and then we're looking at
 
02:19:27.389 --> 02:19:27.399 align:start position:0%
um this Final Phase of warning people
 
02:19:29.509 --> 02:19:29.519 align:start position:0%
about the change and eligibility
 
02:19:33.589 --> 02:19:33.599 align:start position:0%
criteria we're going to use um purple
 
02:19:36.509 --> 02:19:36.519 align:start position:0%
paper to you know just to get people to
 
02:19:39.270 --> 02:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
notice what we're sending to them um and
 
02:19:42.669 --> 02:19:42.679 align:start position:0%
to try to get action and it's amazing
 
02:19:44.790 --> 02:19:44.800 align:start position:0%
you know what we did there got picked up
 
02:19:46.309 --> 02:19:46.319 align:start position:0%
nationally and number of different other
 
02:19:48.910 --> 02:19:48.920 align:start position:0%
states you know use that technique too
 
02:19:51.870 --> 02:19:51.880 align:start position:0%
and um and you know it's important that
 
02:19:53.950 --> 02:19:53.960 align:start position:0%
you know anybody who's really eligible
 
02:19:55.550 --> 02:19:55.560 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure stays eligible
 
02:19:59.190 --> 02:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
those who are not we we we have to close
 
02:20:00.590 --> 02:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
them because they don't meet the
 
02:20:02.710 --> 02:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
criteria on the other hand we also try
 
02:20:06.910 --> 02:20:06.920 align:start position:0%
to work with um the The Navigators that
 
02:20:09.590 --> 02:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
are um and we try to make referrals to
 
02:20:12.030 --> 02:20:12.040 align:start position:0%
to help people get to the right place um
 
02:20:13.710 --> 02:20:13.720 align:start position:0%
where they might be able to get coverage
 
02:20:16.630 --> 02:20:16.640 align:start position:0%
representative Daniels for a
 
02:20:19.070 --> 02:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
question thank you referring to the
 
02:20:21.750 --> 02:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
chart on page 13 we know how much and
 
02:20:24.270 --> 02:20:24.280 align:start position:0%
benefits might have been paid out to
 
02:20:27.910 --> 02:20:27.920 align:start position:0%
people prior to February 24 that were
 
02:20:27.920 --> 02:20:33.750 align:start position:0%
people prior to February 24 that were
not

02:20:33.750 --> 02:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:37.190 --> 02:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
eligible I don't I think that if I'm can
 
02:20:38.349 --> 02:20:38.359 align:start position:0%
make sure I'm understanding your
 
02:20:39.670 --> 02:20:39.680 align:start position:0%
question I think what you're saying is
 
02:20:42.750 --> 02:20:42.760 align:start position:0%
that there were individuals who no
 
02:20:45.950 --> 02:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
longer really qualified and that the
 
02:20:48.910 --> 02:20:48.920 align:start position:0%
state uh because of the continuous
 
02:20:53.309 --> 02:20:53.319 align:start position:0%
coverage needed to keep them covered um
 
02:20:56.670 --> 02:20:56.680 align:start position:0%
we do we knew that
 
02:20:59.030 --> 02:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
um at the end of March there were about
 
02:21:02.190 --> 02:21:02.200 align:start position:0%
30,000 individuals who based on the
 
02:21:05.990 --> 02:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
information we had um were likely over
 
02:21:10.870 --> 02:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
income and we um we closed all of them
 
02:21:12.469 --> 02:21:12.479 align:start position:0%
that we could we had to give them a
 
02:21:15.110 --> 02:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
chance to let us know if the information
 
02:21:18.710 --> 02:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
that we had um wasn't accurate um you
 
02:21:21.910 --> 02:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
know income sometimes it can lags in in
 
02:21:25.110 --> 02:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
in the public sources that we can access
 
02:21:27.230 --> 02:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
um and the information that they provide
 
02:21:29.830 --> 02:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
but you know before we planned our
 
02:21:33.510 --> 02:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
unwind um to we had done analytics on
 
02:21:35.990 --> 02:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
the the people who were still eligible
 
02:21:38.349 --> 02:21:38.359 align:start position:0%
and we looked at those where we had a
 
02:21:40.270 --> 02:21:40.280 align:start position:0%
good sense that they were over income we
 
02:21:42.750 --> 02:21:42.760 align:start position:0%
closed those first then we we went to
 
02:21:46.030 --> 02:21:46.040 align:start position:0%
granted Advantage you know secondarily
 
02:21:48.630 --> 02:21:48.640 align:start position:0%
because again a lot of the what we see
 
02:21:50.309 --> 02:21:50.319 align:start position:0%
is typically a short tenure there some
 
02:21:51.870 --> 02:21:51.880 align:start position:0%
people have been on granted Advantage
 
02:21:53.830 --> 02:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
for a number of years and so what we try
 
02:21:55.270 --> 02:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
to do is structure the unwind so that
 
02:21:57.830 --> 02:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
the most vulnerable people had the most
 
02:22:01.590 --> 02:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
time to react to the the unwind like the
 
02:22:03.230 --> 02:22:03.240 align:start position:0%
people in nursing homes the people in
 
02:22:06.190 --> 02:22:06.200 align:start position:0%
home and commun Based Services because
 
02:22:08.349 --> 02:22:08.359 align:start position:0%
they were likely you know they're likely
 
02:22:10.030 --> 02:22:10.040 align:start position:0%
to remain eligible their income probably
 
02:22:12.190 --> 02:22:12.200 align:start position:0%
didn't change whereas you know certain
 
02:22:14.790 --> 02:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
populations did and so we protected
 
02:22:17.510 --> 02:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
children the longest then a little bit
 
02:22:18.990 --> 02:22:19.000 align:start position:0%
longer the homeing community base and
 
02:22:20.990 --> 02:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
then the nursing home IND individuals
 
02:22:25.349 --> 02:22:25.359 align:start position:0%
and we protected them by because what
 
02:22:27.710 --> 02:22:27.720 align:start position:0%
what feds were telling to States is we
 
02:22:29.110 --> 02:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
didn't want you to do everything all at
 
02:22:30.750 --> 02:22:30.760 align:start position:0%
one time because you would create a
 
02:22:33.270 --> 02:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
workload that would be like a a large
 
02:22:36.150 --> 02:22:36.160 align:start position:0%
distribution they wanted you to have uh
 
02:22:37.950 --> 02:22:37.960 align:start position:0%
at the end to end up with a a
 
02:22:39.469 --> 02:22:39.479 align:start position:0%
distribution that you could handle on a
 
02:22:41.230 --> 02:22:41.240 align:start position:0%
regular basis so you didn't have delays
 
02:22:43.990 --> 02:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
in moving people off or bringing people
 
02:22:47.190 --> 02:22:47.200 align:start position:0%
on and so we did do a lot of work in
 
02:22:49.750 --> 02:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
that space to figure out what we should
 
02:22:53.110 --> 02:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
do and when we should do it um so there
 
02:22:55.349 --> 02:22:55.359 align:start position:0%
are I don't have an exact dollar figure
 
02:22:56.870 --> 02:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
but I think the the best thing I could
 
02:22:58.910 --> 02:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
give you there is I think that at the
 
02:23:01.710 --> 02:23:01.720 align:start position:0%
time that it ended there were 30,000
 
02:23:03.750 --> 02:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
individuals approximately I believe that
 
02:23:08.630 --> 02:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
we were able to close right up front and
 
02:23:12.429 --> 02:23:12.439 align:start position:0%
and uh those that that we did close we
 
02:23:15.349 --> 02:23:15.359 align:start position:0%
did um plenty of work ahead of time to
 
02:23:17.230 --> 02:23:17.240 align:start position:0%
make sure they were aware of it that
 
02:23:19.190 --> 02:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
they had an opportunity to let us know
 
02:23:21.750 --> 02:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
if we didn't have good information
 
02:23:23.230 --> 02:23:23.240 align:start position:0%
and for those people who did nothing and
 
02:23:26.870 --> 02:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
never responded to us we even had uh
 
02:23:28.870 --> 02:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
developed um we were the only state in
 
02:23:31.150 --> 02:23:31.160 align:start position:0%
the nation to do this but to be able to
 
02:23:34.269 --> 02:23:34.279 align:start position:0%
connect that um they had a chance their
 
02:23:38.510 --> 02:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
case was referred to the the
 
02:23:43.870 --> 02:23:43.880 align:start position:0%
um s CIO which is the the uh agency
 
02:23:47.550 --> 02:23:47.560 align:start position:0%
within HS that that oversees the ACA
 
02:23:50.550 --> 02:23:50.560 align:start position:0%
coverage that um they they check to see
 
02:23:52.190 --> 02:23:52.200 align:start position:0%
if they would be eligible for ACA
 
02:23:53.550 --> 02:23:53.560 align:start position:0%
coverage and they would have an
 
02:23:56.750 --> 02:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to to hear about that so I
 
02:24:00.790 --> 02:24:00.800 align:start position:0%
think um we try to both be um Humane in
 
02:24:02.830 --> 02:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
terms of you know the people that would
 
02:24:04.990 --> 02:24:05.000 align:start position:0%
have challenges to give them the longest
 
02:24:07.550 --> 02:24:07.560 align:start position:0%
time those people who are probably more
 
02:24:09.309 --> 02:24:09.319 align:start position:0%
able-bodied if you will that we did
 
02:24:12.870 --> 02:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
those individuals up front um and we
 
02:24:14.790 --> 02:24:14.800 align:start position:0%
where we couldn't keep them eligible we
 
02:24:16.910 --> 02:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
at least try to give them referrals to
 
02:24:18.910 --> 02:24:18.920 align:start position:0%
you know options that were available
 
02:24:21.670 --> 02:24:21.680 align:start position:0%
elsewhere um we do know that a good
 
02:24:23.630 --> 02:24:23.640 align:start position:0%
number of the people who left Medicaid
 
02:24:26.070 --> 02:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
um we did a a
 
02:24:31.190 --> 02:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
survey um with a a a company that um was
 
02:24:34.950 --> 02:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
trying to test an approach to uh um I
 
02:24:36.790 --> 02:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
think we surveyed about 5,000
 
02:24:39.510 --> 02:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
individuals who had closed and lo found
 
02:24:42.429 --> 02:24:42.439 align:start position:0%
out that I think it was like over 60% of
 
02:24:43.950 --> 02:24:43.960 align:start position:0%
them had found another source of
 
02:24:47.950 --> 02:24:47.960 align:start position:0%
insurance um and so I do think that
 
02:24:50.910 --> 02:24:50.920 align:start position:0%
we've you know I'm not saying we were
 
02:24:52.590 --> 02:24:52.600 align:start position:0%
the best state at doing this but I think
 
02:24:54.590 --> 02:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
we were among the best in terms of of
 
02:24:57.309 --> 02:24:57.319 align:start position:0%
doing um that whole unwind process and
 
02:24:59.389 --> 02:24:59.399 align:start position:0%
we put a lot of thinking into it
 
02:25:01.990 --> 02:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
representative Nano for a question yeah
 
02:25:03.990 --> 02:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
a quick question on that and this is uh
 
02:25:07.110 --> 02:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
maybe you know not not a totally fair
 
02:25:09.190 --> 02:25:09.200 align:start position:0%
question but what's Your Gut feel for
 
02:25:13.269 --> 02:25:13.279 align:start position:0%
what the trend line uh on table on page
 
02:25:17.190 --> 02:25:17.200 align:start position:0%
13 going forward would look like given I
 
02:25:18.670 --> 02:25:18.680 align:start position:0%
think given the experience that you've
 
02:25:20.070 --> 02:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
had and what you've just described in
 
02:25:23.150 --> 02:25:23.160 align:start position:0%
terms terms of the the detailed process
 
02:25:25.630 --> 02:25:25.640 align:start position:0%
that uh you go through um I think we're
 
02:25:28.309 --> 02:25:28.319 align:start position:0%
going to continue the process I think it
 
02:25:30.870 --> 02:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
you know the the period of the last 12
 
02:25:33.070 --> 02:25:33.080 align:start position:0%
months was sort of the tail end of any
 
02:25:35.110 --> 02:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
unwinding we had to do so I you know I
 
02:25:38.309 --> 02:25:38.319 align:start position:0%
think anywhere between 8,000 and 10,000
 
02:25:41.469 --> 02:25:41.479 align:start position:0%
is you know realistic that circumstances
 
02:25:42.790 --> 02:25:42.800 align:start position:0%
change as I mentioned in the grand
 
02:25:44.510 --> 02:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
Advantage Program the tenure there is
 
02:25:48.469 --> 02:25:48.479 align:start position:0%
less than a year um on
 
02:25:51.150 --> 02:25:51.160 align:start position:0%
average so going forward the trend line
 
02:25:53.349 --> 02:25:53.359 align:start position:0%
is is down in terms of down a little bit
 
02:25:56.429 --> 02:25:56.439 align:start position:0%
because I think we've narrowed the the
 
02:25:58.750 --> 02:25:58.760 align:start position:0%
we've we're now doing annual um
 
02:26:00.830 --> 02:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
redeterminations as opposed to
 
02:26:03.389 --> 02:26:03.399 align:start position:0%
previously we had because of federal
 
02:26:04.790 --> 02:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
Public Health Emergency we had some
 
02:26:06.990 --> 02:26:07.000 align:start position:0%
people three to four years before they
 
02:26:12.590 --> 02:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:18.550 --> 02:26:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:22.309 --> 02:26:22.319 align:start position:0%
15 so 15 was the one that I pointed out
 
02:26:26.150 --> 02:26:26.160 align:start position:0%
that um the result of the end of the the
 
02:26:28.469 --> 02:26:28.479 align:start position:0%
the federal Flex flexibilities that this
 
02:26:30.070 --> 02:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
is just an example of the month of March
 
02:26:32.110 --> 02:26:32.120 align:start position:0%
that we've modeled out to give you a
 
02:26:34.070 --> 02:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
sense that the workload for the
 
02:26:38.110 --> 02:26:38.120 align:start position:0%
eligibility folks is going to increase
 
02:26:41.590 --> 02:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
um that if we had the PO if we if the
 
02:26:44.150 --> 02:26:44.160 align:start position:0%
e14 authorities the flexibilities had
 
02:26:48.269 --> 02:26:48.279 align:start position:0%
ended in this this month there would be
 
02:26:55.230 --> 02:26:55.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:57.630 --> 02:26:57.640 align:start position:0%
redetermination as opposed
 
02:27:01.349 --> 02:27:01.359 align:start position:0%
to systemic which is that's 3,000 for
 
02:27:03.309 --> 02:27:03.319 align:start position:0%
just that month you know every other
 
02:27:05.990 --> 02:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
month could be you know in that same
 
02:27:08.510 --> 02:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
range um we're we're figuring that
 
02:27:09.910 --> 02:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
there's going to
 
02:27:13.389 --> 02:27:13.399 align:start position:0%
be compared to the last four years
 
02:27:18.710 --> 02:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
between 20 and 25% more cases to have
 
02:27:20.710 --> 02:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
more um
 
02:27:22.590 --> 02:27:22.600 align:start position:0%
human intervention in order to determine
 
02:27:24.670 --> 02:27:24.680 align:start position:0%
eligibility that the system won't be
 
02:27:27.790 --> 02:27:27.800 align:start position:0%
able to to do it alone
 
02:27:30.429 --> 02:27:30.439 align:start position:0%
um and uh so that's that's where I'm
 
02:27:32.550 --> 02:27:32.560 align:start position:0%
concerned about from
 
02:27:35.870 --> 02:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
a from a constituent service standpoint
 
02:27:39.670 --> 02:27:39.680 align:start position:0%
the the issue of not um delaying people
 
02:27:41.790 --> 02:27:41.800 align:start position:0%
who are eligible because we're dealing
 
02:27:43.830 --> 02:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
with people to find out whether they're
 
02:27:46.429 --> 02:27:46.439 align:start position:0%
eligible or not that that collision
 
02:27:49.710 --> 02:27:49.720 align:start position:0%
between the additional workload is it's
 
02:27:51.910 --> 02:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
you know what I'm trying to do is you
 
02:27:54.590 --> 02:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
know share up front that we're going to
 
02:27:58.150 --> 02:27:58.160 align:start position:0%
be the eligibility team which is not my
 
02:28:00.910 --> 02:28:00.920 align:start position:0%
unit but a unit that I depend on is
 
02:28:02.990 --> 02:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
going to be under a lot more stress with
 
02:28:05.429 --> 02:28:05.439 align:start position:0%
respect to the workload um that they
 
02:28:07.950 --> 02:28:07.960 align:start position:0%
have to contend with it's it's
 
02:28:11.469 --> 02:28:11.479 align:start position:0%
effectively we do about 12,000
 
02:28:14.710 --> 02:28:14.720 align:start position:0%
13,000 um of these redeterminations a
 
02:28:18.230 --> 02:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
month if if if 3,000 is the average it's
 
02:28:20.150 --> 02:28:20.160 align:start position:0%
it's really like getting 3 months of
 
02:28:21.990 --> 02:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
extra work to do over what we've been
 
02:28:26.230 --> 02:28:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:26.240 --> 02:28:27.990 align:start position:0%
 
years

02:28:27.990 --> 02:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:28:34.910 --> 02:28:34.920 align:start position:0%
um slides 18 uh excuse me 161 17 are uh
 
02:28:37.070 --> 02:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
ones that we shared with you previously
 
02:28:41.070 --> 02:28:41.080 align:start position:0%
but the the flesh car line um I think we
 
02:28:43.150 --> 02:28:43.160 align:start position:0%
had provided last time was sort of the
 
02:28:44.910 --> 02:28:44.920 align:start position:0%
aggregate of what happened between March
 
02:28:48.630 --> 02:28:48.640 align:start position:0%
of 23 and July of 24 in terms of um
 
02:28:48.640 --> 02:28:50.590 align:start position:0%
of 23 and July of 24 in terms of um
successfully

02:28:50.590 --> 02:28:50.600 align:start position:0%
successfully
 
02:28:51.750 --> 02:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
completing a
 
02:28:55.830 --> 02:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
redetermination those people who were um
 
02:28:58.429 --> 02:28:58.439 align:start position:0%
not part of the protected group meaning
 
02:29:00.349 --> 02:29:00.359 align:start position:0%
that weren't under continuous coverage
 
02:29:02.309 --> 02:29:02.319 align:start position:0%
renewed at a much higher rate than those
 
02:29:05.630 --> 02:29:05.640 align:start position:0%
that were in the the the protected group
 
02:29:07.950 --> 02:29:07.960 align:start position:0%
and um what we did here was just give
 
02:29:09.469 --> 02:29:09.479 align:start position:0%
you a little bit more of a historical
 
02:29:11.990 --> 02:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
look at it back to August the 24 month
 
02:29:13.870 --> 02:29:13.880 align:start position:0%
by month but the number of people who
 
02:29:16.550 --> 02:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
are retaining Medicaid Eligibility at
 
02:29:20.150 --> 02:29:20.160 align:start position:0%
you know in the '90s is you know pre
 
02:29:23.349 --> 02:29:23.359 align:start position:0%
pandemic it was like in the 70s or 60s
 
02:29:26.590 --> 02:29:26.600 align:start position:0%
um and the concern you know that people
 
02:29:31.309 --> 02:29:31.319 align:start position:0%
who are eligible um with with the the
 
02:29:33.510 --> 02:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
loss of those flexibilities and the
 
02:29:36.150 --> 02:29:36.160 align:start position:0%
increased workload that um we'll see
 
02:29:40.670 --> 02:29:40.680 align:start position:0%
more churn um churn is okay if it's
 
02:29:42.110 --> 02:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
intended because they're not really
 
02:29:43.870 --> 02:29:43.880 align:start position:0%
eligible but we don't want churn because
 
02:29:47.070 --> 02:29:47.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:50.950 --> 02:29:50.960 align:start position:0%
work and I think um if if you're okay
 
02:29:53.150 --> 02:29:53.160 align:start position:0%
um representative that we'd be ready to
 
02:29:55.469 --> 02:29:55.479 align:start position:0%
tackle hb2 if if you want to get to that
 
02:29:57.429 --> 02:29:57.439 align:start position:0%
or take any more questions thank you I
 
02:29:58.830 --> 02:29:58.840 align:start position:0%
appreciate that and again this
 
02:30:00.910 --> 02:30:00.920 align:start position:0%
presentation will be found online on our
 
02:30:03.990 --> 02:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
material page both from the LBA website
 
02:30:06.150 --> 02:30:06.160 align:start position:0%
and the department of administrative
 
02:30:08.950 --> 02:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
Services my thought at this point is to
 
02:30:13.030 --> 02:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
take a five minute recess when we return
 
02:30:14.670 --> 02:30:14.680 align:start position:0%
start through the provisions of House
 
02:30:18.469 --> 02:30:18.479 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 until approximately noon come
 
02:30:21.230 --> 02:30:21.240 align:start position:0%
back at 12:
 
02:30:26.870 --> 02:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
45 um I'd like to take up House Bill 71
 
02:30:26.880 --> 02:30:28.550 align:start position:0%
45 um I'd like to take up House Bill 71
at

02:30:28.550 --> 02:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
at
 
02:30:31.309 --> 02:30:31.319 align:start position:0%
1 um and again these are just my
 
02:30:34.590 --> 02:30:34.600 align:start position:0%
thoughts that should be brief and then
 
02:30:39.990 --> 02:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
have you resume if necessary after that
 
02:30:42.309 --> 02:30:42.319 align:start position:0%
does that make sense to you that's
 
02:30:44.429 --> 02:30:44.439 align:start position:0%
whatever you your pleasure will be here
 
02:30:46.590 --> 02:30:46.600 align:start position:0%
your thoughts representative tar I just
 
02:30:49.190 --> 02:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
want to clarify what I heard um I guess
 
02:30:51.750 --> 02:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
I'm questioning the coming back at 12:45
 
02:30:54.830 --> 02:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
if we are noticed for 1: p.m. are you
 
02:30:57.389 --> 02:30:57.399 align:start position:0%
intending for Mr Lipman to go for 15
 
02:31:00.309 --> 02:31:00.319 align:start position:0%
minutes then stop then one and I and I
 
02:31:03.389 --> 02:31:03.399 align:start position:0%
also just want to clarify that the um uh
 
02:31:05.750 --> 02:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
my caucus actually or my side actually
 
02:31:08.510 --> 02:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
has a caucus a lunchtime caucus from 12:
 
02:31:09.870 --> 02:31:09.880 align:start position:0%
to hopefully
 
02:31:12.510 --> 02:31:12.520 align:start position:0%
1 so those 15 minutes is what I'm just
 
02:31:14.710 --> 02:31:14.720 align:start position:0%
questioning okay in that case because of
 
02:31:18.469 --> 02:31:18.479 align:start position:0%
the caucus why don't we break from 12 to
 
02:31:21.990 --> 02:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
1 that's perfect
 
02:31:25.030 --> 02:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
okay okay all right we're in recess for
 
02:31:48.830 --> 02:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:48.840 --> 02:32:18.830 align:start position:0%
 
great

02:32:18.830 --> 02:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:18.840 --> 02:32:48.830 align:start position:0%
 
e

02:32:48.830 --> 02:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:48.840 --> 02:33:18.750 align:start position:0%
 
e

02:33:18.750 --> 02:33:18.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:18.760 --> 02:33:48.710 align:start position:0%
 
e

02:33:48.710 --> 02:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:48.720 --> 02:34:18.710 align:start position:0%
 
e

02:34:18.710 --> 02:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:18.720 --> 02:34:48.630 align:start position:0%
 
e

02:34:48.630 --> 02:34:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:48.640 --> 02:35:18.630 align:start position:0%
 
e

02:35:18.630 --> 02:35:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:18.640 --> 02:35:48.630 align:start position:0%
 
e

02:35:48.630 --> 02:35:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:45.349 --> 02:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:48.750 --> 02:36:48.760 align:start position:0%
okay we'll resume after what was just a
 
02:36:52.550 --> 02:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
five minute brief recess this is a work
 
02:36:55.469 --> 02:36:55.479 align:start position:0%
session continued on the division of
 
02:36:59.550 --> 02:36:59.560 align:start position:0%
Medicaid continued from February 21st
 
02:37:02.150 --> 02:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
for those who want to go back and watch
 
02:37:05.870 --> 02:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
YouTube the part one was February 21st
 
02:37:07.429 --> 02:37:07.439 align:start position:0%
for division
 
02:37:10.309 --> 02:37:10.319 align:start position:0%
3 so our plan now is we're going to go
 
02:37:13.910 --> 02:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
to 12 noon we're going to start through
 
02:37:16.830 --> 02:37:16.840 align:start position:0%
the provisions relative to Medicaid in
 
02:37:18.510 --> 02:37:18.520 align:start position:0%

page 48 eight am I correct of House Bill
 
02:37:26.990 --> 02:37:27.000 align:start position:0%

come back at 1:00 at 1:00 is scheduled
 
02:37:33.710 --> 02:37:33.720 align:start position:0%
and has been duly noticed a work session
 
02:37:34.990 --> 02:37:35.000 align:start position:0%
on House Bill
 
02:37:39.950 --> 02:37:39.960 align:start position:0%
71 so we'll do that uh if we need uh Mr
 
02:37:43.710 --> 02:37:43.720 align:start position:0%
Lipman and Mr White to come back after
 
02:37:46.030 --> 02:37:46.040 align:start position:0%
that house bill 71 work session to
 
02:37:49.550 --> 02:37:49.560 align:start position:0%
continue the discussion on Medicaid
 
02:37:51.030 --> 02:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
specifically the provisions of House
 
02:37:55.070 --> 02:37:55.080 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 will do that so that's where we
 
02:37:57.710 --> 02:37:57.720 align:start position:0%
are that's the lay of the land today uh
 
02:37:59.630 --> 02:37:59.640 align:start position:0%
so gentlemen uh thank you again for
 
02:38:01.070 --> 02:38:01.080 align:start position:0%
always making yourselves available
 
02:38:03.190 --> 02:38:03.200 align:start position:0%
especially a reschedule a continuation I
 
02:38:05.510 --> 02:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
should say a continuation of Medicaid
 
02:38:08.230 --> 02:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
discussion and we'll begin when you're
 
02:38:10.389 --> 02:38:10.399 align:start position:0%
ready I have House Bill two in front of
 
02:38:13.510 --> 02:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
me great so uh again Nathan white Chief
 
02:38:14.670 --> 02:38:14.680 align:start position:0%
Financial Officer with the Department of
 
02:38:16.349 --> 02:38:16.359 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services what may be
 
02:38:19.070 --> 02:38:19.080 align:start position:0%
helpful for members is if you look back
 
02:38:21.590 --> 02:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
at the presentation uh from the Friday
 
02:38:24.910 --> 02:38:24.920 align:start position:0%
from the week before um slide 21
 
02:38:28.110 --> 02:38:28.120 align:start position:0%
detailed the the specific reductions or
 
02:38:30.510 --> 02:38:30.520 align:start position:0%
assumed reductions in the governor's
 
02:38:32.910 --> 02:38:32.920 align:start position:0%
budget and it may be helpful just to
 
02:38:35.510 --> 02:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
have that open as we go through the hb2
 
02:38:38.710 --> 02:38:38.720 align:start position:0%
provisions just so I I can certainly
 
02:38:41.590 --> 02:38:41.600 align:start position:0%
narrate you know this is a $3.3 million
 
02:38:43.630 --> 02:38:43.640 align:start position:0%
assumption for each year but it may be
 
02:38:45.190 --> 02:38:45.200 align:start position:0%
helpful just to have the members have
 
02:38:47.429 --> 02:38:47.439 align:start position:0%
that open so for future reference in
 
02:38:50.070 --> 02:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
case it was needed I'm sorry you said SL
 
02:38:55.750 --> 02:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
31 21 21 that we heard on February 21
 
02:38:57.870 --> 02:38:57.880 align:start position:0%
makes it easy to remember yes thank you
 
02:39:00.750 --> 02:39:00.760 align:start position:0%
for that the Friday afternoon session
 
02:39:06.590 --> 02:39:06.600 align:start position:0%
okay so in the uh hb2 as introduced um
 
02:39:09.990 --> 02:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
beginning on page 48 as uh co-chairman M
 
02:39:13.910 --> 02:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
money had indicated the first section
 
02:39:17.190 --> 02:39:17.200 align:start position:0%
that I will draw your attention to is
 
02:39:19.870 --> 02:39:19.880 align:start position:0%
section 89 this is The Graduate medic
 
02:39:23.150 --> 02:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
medical education payments um this is a
 
02:39:25.030 --> 02:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
a program that's being suspended for the
 
02:39:28.870 --> 02:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
bium if the if the committee sought to
 
02:39:30.510 --> 02:39:30.520 align:start position:0%
uh fund this we would need additional
 
02:39:32.190 --> 02:39:32.200 align:start position:0%
General funds it has been funded in a
 
02:39:33.429 --> 02:39:33.439 align:start position:0%
number of
 
02:39:36.870 --> 02:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
Bia um the second provision there is uh
 
02:39:40.550 --> 02:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
section 90 it's on line 26 page 48 this
 
02:39:42.110 --> 02:39:42.120 align:start position:0%
is suspension of catastrophic Aid
 
02:39:44.550 --> 02:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
payments to hospital uh this is similar
 
02:39:46.389 --> 02:39:46.399 align:start position:0%
this has not been funded in a number of
 
02:39:49.030 --> 02:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
Bia and additional General funds would
 
02:39:51.950 --> 02:39:51.960 align:start position:0%
be needed to fund that program section
 
02:39:54.389 --> 02:39:54.399 align:start position:0%
91 on line 30 is Medicaid to schools
 
02:39:55.790 --> 02:39:55.800 align:start position:0%
program fiscal committee approval of
 
02:39:59.030 --> 02:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
supplemental funding um this has been in
 
02:40:02.110 --> 02:40:02.120 align:start position:0%
effect for a couple of Bania this is an
 
02:40:04.190 --> 02:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
hb2 provision that's just been chapter
 
02:40:06.790 --> 02:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
law this allows the department to accept
 
02:40:08.150 --> 02:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
additional federal funds for the
 
02:40:10.469 --> 02:40:10.479 align:start position:0%
Medicaid to schools program uh just as a
 
02:40:12.070 --> 02:40:12.080 align:start position:0%
reminder going back to the conversation
 
02:40:14.750 --> 02:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
that we had there is no direct general
 
02:40:17.870 --> 02:40:17.880 align:start position:0%
fund cost to the state for this this
 
02:40:19.950 --> 02:40:19.960 align:start position:0%
simply allows the department
 
02:40:21.710 --> 02:40:21.720 align:start position:0%
um to accept the federal funds in the
 
02:40:25.070 --> 02:40:25.080 align:start position:0%
event that the budgeted amounts exceed
 
02:40:27.790 --> 02:40:27.800 align:start position:0%
uh what we what we are appropriated um
 
02:40:31.070 --> 02:40:31.080 align:start position:0%
we have not had to use this provision um
 
02:40:33.190 --> 02:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
since since it's Inception but it is
 
02:40:35.110 --> 02:40:35.120 align:start position:0%
something that uh we did originally
 
02:40:37.670 --> 02:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
request in our agency budget and form e
 
02:40:37.680 --> 02:40:38.710 align:start position:0%
request in our agency budget and form e
to

02:40:38.710 --> 02:40:38.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:40:43.830 --> 02:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
continue uh moving on to page 49 section
 
02:40:47.830 --> 02:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
92 um this provision here this is the
 
02:40:49.830 --> 02:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
carry forward provision that that we
 
02:40:52.750 --> 02:40:52.760 align:start position:0%
have discussed this is um some some
 
02:40:55.349 --> 02:40:55.359 align:start position:0%
states have this we've had this uh in
 
02:40:57.950 --> 02:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
hb2 since the pandemic and what this
 
02:40:59.910 --> 02:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
allows the department to do is carry
 
02:41:03.510 --> 02:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
forward funds from one Bia to the next
 
02:41:06.309 --> 02:41:06.319 align:start position:0%
under state law I think it's under rs9
 
02:41:09.030 --> 02:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
uh any general funds would naturally
 
02:41:11.550 --> 02:41:11.560 align:start position:0%
lapse back to the general fund coffers
 
02:41:14.070 --> 02:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
given the ups and downs in Medicaid
 
02:41:16.389 --> 02:41:16.399 align:start position:0%
relative to enrollment Trends and things
 
02:41:17.630 --> 02:41:17.640 align:start position:0%
of that nature we work with our
 
02:41:20.110 --> 02:41:20.120 align:start position:0%
actuaries to to
 
02:41:22.830 --> 02:41:22.840 align:start position:0%
what those would be but there there are
 
02:41:25.070 --> 02:41:25.080 align:start position:0%
always potential changes um what this
 
02:41:27.269 --> 02:41:27.279 align:start position:0%
does is by allowing the funds to be
 
02:41:29.830 --> 02:41:29.840 align:start position:0%
carried forward um you actually see a
 
02:41:31.870 --> 02:41:31.880 align:start position:0%
net reduction in the total General funds
 
02:41:34.510 --> 02:41:34.520 align:start position:0%
that are needed in the Medicaid budget
 
02:41:37.950 --> 02:41:37.960 align:start position:0%
um in state fiscal year 26 and
 
02:41:37.960 --> 02:41:39.510 align:start position:0%
um in state fiscal year 26 and
27

02:41:39.510 --> 02:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
27
 
02:41:43.630 --> 02:41:43.640 align:start position:0%
um and from there we move forward a
 
02:41:45.670 --> 02:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
couple and and just one key provision
 
02:41:47.030 --> 02:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
there is the effective date it needs to
 
02:41:49.670 --> 02:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
be effective June 30th 2025 otherwise
 
02:41:51.510 --> 02:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
those funds would
 
02:41:55.630 --> 02:41:55.640 align:start position:0%
lapse and now if you yes representative
 
02:42:00.030 --> 02:42:00.040 align:start position:0%
tarki for a question in a scenario where
 
02:42:01.790 --> 02:42:01.800 align:start position:0%
perhaps the governor doesn't sign the
 
02:42:06.110 --> 02:42:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:08.950 --> 02:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
happens that's one of those uh
 
02:42:10.750 --> 02:42:10.760 align:start position:0%
situations where we have to work through
 
02:42:13.070 --> 02:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
it with the advice of our
 
02:42:16.950 --> 02:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
Council um to interpret the laws as they
 
02:42:19.309 --> 02:42:19.319 align:start position:0%
stand it would kind of depend on what
 
02:42:21.389 --> 02:42:21.399 align:start position:0%
the continuing resolution specified so
 
02:42:23.710 --> 02:42:23.720 align:start position:0%
if it specified that all provisions of
 
02:42:25.910 --> 02:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
law continue or if it made reference to
 
02:42:28.950 --> 02:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
to the existing hb2 then perhaps those
 
02:42:30.670 --> 02:42:30.680 align:start position:0%
funds could be carried forward and they
 
02:42:33.150 --> 02:42:33.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't lapse um it would really be
 
02:42:34.870 --> 02:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
dependent upon the language in in the in
 
02:42:37.190 --> 02:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
the C okay yeah that's what I thought
 
02:42:39.389 --> 02:42:39.399 align:start position:0%
okay thanks I appreciate the
 
02:42:39.399 --> 02:42:40.950 align:start position:0%
okay thanks I appreciate the
question

02:42:40.950 --> 02:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:42:45.710 --> 02:42:45.720 align:start position:0%
okay so moving forward
 
02:42:48.510 --> 02:42:48.520 align:start position:0%
to going to move a couple Pages forward
 
02:42:51.590 --> 02:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
here I believe the next relevant
 
02:42:55.550 --> 02:42:55.560 align:start position:0%
provision is uh
 
02:43:00.110 --> 02:43:00.120 align:start position:0%
102 this is the um there's a there's a
 
02:43:02.190 --> 02:43:02.200 align:start position:0%
corresponding Bill uh that's currently
 
02:43:04.630 --> 02:43:04.640 align:start position:0%
moving through the process this this is
 
02:43:08.349 --> 02:43:08.359 align:start position:0%
this provision 102 and 103 this was
 
02:43:11.429 --> 02:43:11.439 align:start position:0%
relative to the department being able to
 
02:43:13.550 --> 02:43:13.560 align:start position:0%
purchase brand name drugs there's
 
02:43:15.790 --> 02:43:15.800 align:start position:0%
currently a statutory prohibition on us
 
02:43:17.790 --> 02:43:17.800 align:start position:0%
purchasing brand named drugs where
 
02:43:19.910 --> 02:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
there's a generic equivalent
 
02:43:24.349 --> 02:43:24.359 align:start position:0%
um on slide 21 of the presentation from
 
02:43:27.910 --> 02:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
the 21st you will see the the cost
 
02:43:30.630 --> 02:43:30.640 align:start position:0%
savings there it it come it's it's under
 
02:43:32.349 --> 02:43:32.359 align:start position:0%
the preferred drug list savings it's
 
02:43:36.150 --> 02:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
$930,000 assumed Savings in the first
 
02:43:39.030 --> 02:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
year and then two almost $3 million in
 
02:43:41.750 --> 02:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
the second year and that's the result of
 
02:43:45.630 --> 02:43:45.640 align:start position:0%
um us being able to increase the rebate
 
02:43:47.110 --> 02:43:47.120 align:start position:0%
Revenue because there's higher rebates
 
02:43:48.630 --> 02:43:48.640 align:start position:0%
on the brand name drugs I'm going to let
 
02:43:51.110 --> 02:43:51.120 align:start position:0%
Henry jump in here so that it's
 
02:43:52.990 --> 02:43:53.000 align:start position:0%
basically acquiring drugs at the lowest
 
02:43:55.150 --> 02:43:55.160 align:start position:0%
net cost I think there was a question
 
02:43:57.070 --> 02:43:57.080 align:start position:0%
that representative Daniels had early on
 
02:43:58.990 --> 02:43:59.000 align:start position:0%
this does not add it makes it lower both
 
02:44:01.070 --> 02:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
for the state and the federal government
 
02:44:03.590 --> 02:44:03.600 align:start position:0%
um which is um not the usual typical
 
02:44:05.750 --> 02:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
thing I think also too that this is
 
02:44:08.230 --> 02:44:08.240 align:start position:0%
something that you'll see we go from the
 
02:44:10.830 --> 02:44:10.840 align:start position:0%
900 to the 2 million we feel that
 
02:44:13.230 --> 02:44:13.240 align:start position:0%
there's even further savings over time
 
02:44:15.910 --> 02:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
to be had so I think this provision
 
02:44:17.910 --> 02:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
would be you know helpful not only for
 
02:44:21.110 --> 02:44:21.120 align:start position:0%
this banian but the next by am to so we
 
02:44:26.070 --> 02:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:28.990 --> 02:44:29.000 align:start position:0%
one representative tki for question
 
02:44:30.670 --> 02:44:30.680 align:start position:0%
thank you I think you we asked this
 
02:44:31.910 --> 02:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
question last week but I need you to
 
02:44:34.870 --> 02:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
remind me why is the savings like rolled
 
02:44:37.750 --> 02:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
in only 900,000 the first by year by
 
02:44:39.830 --> 02:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
name and then it really ramps up yeah
 
02:44:42.630 --> 02:44:42.640 align:start position:0%
because um people are currently on on
 
02:44:45.670 --> 02:44:45.680 align:start position:0%
drugs right that so you don't want to
 
02:44:47.910 --> 02:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
disrupt someone who may be successfully
 
02:44:49.750 --> 02:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
being treated on
 
02:44:52.750 --> 02:44:52.760 align:start position:0%
patients plus also program Plus getting
 
02:44:55.070 --> 02:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
Physicians um and the mcos sort of
 
02:44:57.510 --> 02:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
geared up for this so it's just I think
 
02:45:00.670 --> 02:45:00.680 align:start position:0%
a matter of um reasonable expectation to
 
02:45:02.150 --> 02:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
make a transition from where we are
 
02:45:06.269 --> 02:45:06.279 align:start position:0%
today to a new place um and that's
 
02:45:08.910 --> 02:45:08.920 align:start position:0%
that's basically uh that's where that's
 
02:45:10.389 --> 02:45:10.399 align:start position:0%
coming from is that it's going to take
 
02:45:12.150 --> 02:45:12.160 align:start position:0%
something to implement it you know for
 
02:45:14.429 --> 02:45:14.439 align:start position:0%
example if the the budget's not signed
 
02:45:16.830 --> 02:45:16.840 align:start position:0%
into law till um you know the end of
 
02:45:19.269 --> 02:45:19.279 align:start position:0%
June or even you know into July right
 
02:45:21.750 --> 02:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
that gotcha IE what you're saying yeah
 
02:45:23.190 --> 02:45:23.200 align:start position:0%
getting the whole system set up and
 
02:45:26.510 --> 02:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
running okay sorry thanks no
 
02:45:29.990 --> 02:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
worries great so moving forward if you
 
02:45:31.910 --> 02:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
turn to page
 
02:45:36.269 --> 02:45:36.279 align:start position:0%
51 and section 107 Department of Health
 
02:45:38.510 --> 02:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
and Human Services Pharmacy copay
 
02:45:42.710 --> 02:45:42.720 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program so this this is the uh
 
02:45:44.269 --> 02:45:44.279 align:start position:0%
this is the provision directing the
 
02:45:46.550 --> 02:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
department uh to establish um
 
02:45:49.429 --> 02:45:49.439 align:start position:0%
prescription drug co-pays up to in an
 
02:45:50.389 --> 02:45:50.399 align:start position:0%
amount of
 
02:45:55.910 --> 02:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
$4 in the um the spreadsheet from the
 
02:45:58.630 --> 02:45:58.640 align:start position:0%
March 21st presentation you'll see that
 
02:46:01.469 --> 02:46:01.479 align:start position:0%
there's an assumed uh total Savings of
 
02:46:04.550 --> 02:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
about $1.5 million in each state fiscal
 
02:46:08.510 --> 02:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:12.670 --> 02:46:12.680 align:start position:0%
Federal okay the next section just below
 
02:46:14.990 --> 02:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
that section 108 uh Department health
 
02:46:17.269 --> 02:46:17.279 align:start position:0%
and human Human Services Medicaid
 
02:46:19.590 --> 02:46:19.600 align:start position:0%
Managed Care
 
02:46:22.110 --> 02:46:22.120 align:start position:0%
um this provision here this directs the
 
02:46:24.950 --> 02:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
department to complete no more than one
 
02:46:27.469 --> 02:46:27.479 align:start position:0%
Medicaid or one Medicaid rate filing
 
02:46:31.309 --> 02:46:31.319 align:start position:0%
each year with CMS and how that results
 
02:46:34.510 --> 02:46:34.520 align:start position:0%
in $500,000 of general fund savings in
 
02:46:37.309 --> 02:46:37.319 align:start position:0%
total across the bium is basically we
 
02:46:40.110 --> 02:46:40.120 align:start position:0%
would need to amend our contract um to
 
02:46:42.429 --> 02:46:42.439 align:start position:0%
reduce the price limitation to to
 
02:46:44.190 --> 02:46:44.200 align:start position:0%
capture those
 
02:46:47.710 --> 02:46:47.720 align:start position:0%
savings M representative tarki for a
 
02:46:49.309 --> 02:46:49.319 align:start position:0%
question thanks I'm sorry getting very
 
02:46:51.110 --> 02:46:51.120 align:start position:0%
nitpicky but trying to understand it in
 
02:46:52.710 --> 02:46:52.720 align:start position:0%
section 107 when we talk about the
 
02:46:55.710 --> 02:46:55.720 align:start position:0%
pharmacy copay when we spoke about this
 
02:46:58.030 --> 02:46:58.040 align:start position:0%
a little over a week ago you stated this
 
02:47:00.469 --> 02:47:00.479 align:start position:0%
would only apply to people who um do not
 
02:47:02.790 --> 02:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
fall under the premium structure and
 
02:47:05.710 --> 02:47:05.720 align:start position:0%
while I Z that's correct yes if they're
 
02:47:07.429 --> 02:47:07.439 align:start position:0%
paying a premium they would not be
 
02:47:09.269 --> 02:47:09.279 align:start position:0%
subject to that so I see this language
 
02:47:11.790 --> 02:47:11.800 align:start position:0%
is pretty straightforward but does not
 
02:47:13.469 --> 02:47:13.479 align:start position:0%
show that exception on the premium
 
02:47:14.790 --> 02:47:14.800 align:start position:0%
language does
 
02:47:17.550 --> 02:47:17.560 align:start position:0%
it I think we're we're covered by the
 
02:47:21.990 --> 02:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
fact that to to under CMS rules and
 
02:47:24.830 --> 02:47:24.840 align:start position:0%
regulations that we have to monitor that
 
02:47:28.309 --> 02:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
we don't exceed the 5% and without the
 
02:47:30.590 --> 02:47:30.600 align:start position:0%
reason that we're just keeping it simple
 
02:47:33.910 --> 02:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
of Premium no co- payment or or no
 
02:47:36.269 --> 02:47:36.279 align:start position:0%
premium co-payment is that we don't have
 
02:47:38.510 --> 02:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
to make significant it changes and
 
02:47:40.990 --> 02:47:41.000 align:start position:0%
absorb all our savings if you will by
 
02:47:43.469 --> 02:47:43.479 align:start position:0%
making all those it changes some states
 
02:47:45.030 --> 02:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
would have both premiums and cost
 
02:47:46.990 --> 02:47:47.000 align:start position:0%
sharing but we're just not configured
 
02:47:49.389 --> 02:47:49.399 align:start position:0%
that way I understand that and and that
 
02:47:50.870 --> 02:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
makes sense to me I guess I'm just
 
02:47:54.230 --> 02:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
trying to see where in this language of
 
02:47:57.510 --> 02:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
the hb2 it makes that delineation that
 
02:48:00.349 --> 02:48:00.359 align:start position:0%
those who pay a co-pay won't have to pay
 
02:48:01.990 --> 02:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
the or those who pay the premium won't
 
02:48:04.030 --> 02:48:04.040 align:start position:0%
have to pay the co-pay because the way I
 
02:48:05.309 --> 02:48:05.319 align:start position:0%
read this right
 
02:48:13.030 --> 02:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:17.670 --> 02:48:17.680 align:start position:0%
everyone I I see your point I I think um
 
02:48:20.830 --> 02:48:20.840 align:start position:0%
that you know the if you wanted to amend
 
02:48:23.110 --> 02:48:23.120 align:start position:0%
something language there that that's how
 
02:48:25.429 --> 02:48:25.439 align:start position:0%
we intend to act and how we intend to
 
02:48:27.870 --> 02:48:27.880 align:start position:0%
remain compliant with CMS regulations is
 
02:48:29.910 --> 02:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
not to do both because we don't have a
 
02:48:34.070 --> 02:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
mechanism to track both co-pays and um
 
02:48:36.190 --> 02:48:36.200 align:start position:0%
but I guess I'm just want to make sure
 
02:48:39.710 --> 02:48:39.720 align:start position:0%
that there's Clarity because I'm I hear
 
02:48:42.469 --> 02:48:42.479 align:start position:0%
you trying to protect the people who are
 
02:48:46.269 --> 02:48:46.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:48.990 --> 02:48:49.000 align:start position:0%
okay excellent any other questions on
 
02:48:51.990 --> 02:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
Section 107 or
 
02:48:57.389 --> 02:48:57.399 align:start position:0%
108 okay um the next section line 32 uh
 
02:48:59.670 --> 02:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
section 109 the Department of Health and
 
02:49:01.030 --> 02:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
Human Services New Hampshire granted
 
02:49:03.269 --> 02:49:03.279 align:start position:0%
Advantage healthc Care Program premiums
 
02:49:05.830 --> 02:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
established um this establishes the
 
02:49:09.429 --> 02:49:09.439 align:start position:0%
premiums and you will see on slide 21
 
02:49:12.110 --> 02:49:12.120 align:start position:0%
there's there's an assumed uh Savings of
 
02:49:15.030 --> 02:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
approximately $12 million to the state
 
02:49:17.349 --> 02:49:17.359 align:start position:0%
and this is not a direct impact to the
 
02:49:19.510 --> 02:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
Department's budget
 
02:49:22.150 --> 02:49:22.160 align:start position:0%
this is an indirect impact to the
 
02:49:24.030 --> 02:49:24.040 align:start position:0%
Department's budget through savings that
 
02:49:25.870 --> 02:49:25.880 align:start position:0%
are um
 
02:49:29.550 --> 02:49:29.560 align:start position:0%
or you will see an increased uh profit
 
02:49:31.750 --> 02:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
margin within the Liquor Commission as a
 
02:49:33.229 --> 02:49:33.239 align:start position:0%
result of this because there there's the
 
02:49:35.429 --> 02:49:35.439 align:start position:0%
assumption that those liquor funds will
 
02:49:37.630 --> 02:49:37.640 align:start position:0%
not be needed to be transferred over to
 
02:49:39.870 --> 02:49:39.880 align:start position:0%
granted Advantage so you won't see the
 
02:49:43.269 --> 02:49:43.279 align:start position:0%
direct impact within division 3 um my
 
02:49:45.510 --> 02:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
assumption is that division one is
 
02:49:48.030 --> 02:49:48.040 align:start position:0%
talking about this uh and they if
 
02:49:49.150 --> 02:49:49.160 align:start position:0%
they're not they certain certain should
 
02:49:51.070 --> 02:49:51.080 align:start position:0%
be uh just because that's where they're
 
02:49:51.950 --> 02:49:51.960 align:start position:0%
going to that's where you're going to
 
02:49:53.990 --> 02:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
see the benefit because of the uh the
 
02:49:55.389 --> 02:49:55.399 align:start position:0%
funding mechanism for the granted
 
02:49:57.710 --> 02:49:57.720 align:start position:0%
Advantage program and you're you were
 
02:50:00.190 --> 02:50:00.200 align:start position:0%
referring to section 109 of House Bill 2
 
02:50:03.990 --> 02:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:06.950 --> 02:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
correct okay representative walner for a
 
02:50:09.710 --> 02:50:09.720 align:start position:0%
question yes I sure you went over this
 
02:50:12.389 --> 02:50:12.399 align:start position:0%
on Friday but how many people do you
 
02:50:16.790 --> 02:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
think this will affect it's um think a
 
02:50:18.750 --> 02:50:18.760 align:start position:0%
little over 10,000 is my recollection
 
02:50:22.950 --> 02:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
that was 11,000 yeah 11,000
 
02:50:25.590 --> 02:50:25.600 align:start position:0%
11,000 thank
 
02:50:30.070 --> 02:50:30.080 align:start position:0%
you okay out of the
 
02:50:33.670 --> 02:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
59 excellent uh so moving forward to
 
02:50:37.229 --> 02:50:37.239 align:start position:0%
page 52 uh section 110 on line one
 
02:50:38.469 --> 02:50:38.479 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
02:50:40.710 --> 02:50:40.720 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program premiums
 
02:50:43.429 --> 02:50:43.439 align:start position:0%
established um so the this is the
 
02:50:47.670 --> 02:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
directive to Institute premiums um
 
02:50:51.030 --> 02:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
within the the chip program for uh
 
02:50:54.190 --> 02:50:54.200 align:start position:0%
families at at or above 255 of the
 
02:50:56.910 --> 02:50:56.920 align:start position:0%
federal poverty limit there's an assume
 
02:51:00.389 --> 02:51:00.399 align:start position:0%
Savings of uh $3.3 million in general
 
02:51:03.349 --> 02:51:03.359 align:start position:0%
funds in state fiscal year 26 and $1
 
02:51:06.630 --> 02:51:06.640 align:start position:0%
million in state fiscal year 27 I if you
 
02:51:11.269 --> 02:51:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:15.550 --> 02:51:15.560 align:start position:0%
the yeah no okay I mean I think that
 
02:51:18.030 --> 02:51:18.040 align:start position:0%
that's we're assuming that that one has
 
02:51:18.040 --> 02:51:19.349 align:start position:0%
that's we're assuming that that one has
to

02:51:19.349 --> 02:51:19.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:51:21.830 --> 02:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
um because of the continuous coverage
 
02:51:24.110 --> 02:51:24.120 align:start position:0%
requirements for children that is
 
02:51:27.030 --> 02:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a rolling in of that
 
02:51:30.670 --> 02:51:30.680 align:start position:0%
um that that uh premium for for families
 
02:51:33.870 --> 02:51:33.880 align:start position:0%
and that you know we do expect that we
 
02:51:35.710 --> 02:51:35.720 align:start position:0%
are going to and I know there are
 
02:51:37.229 --> 02:51:37.239 align:start position:0%
questions out there in terms of what our
 
02:51:40.030 --> 02:51:40.040 align:start position:0%
all polic is going to be around um we
 
02:51:42.469 --> 02:51:42.479 align:start position:0%
haven't got to be able to put that all
 
02:51:44.990 --> 02:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
together yet but you know um would
 
02:51:47.590 --> 02:51:47.600 align:start position:0%
represent to you that um we're going to
 
02:51:49.070 --> 02:51:49.080 align:start position:0%
need to be able to address people who
 
02:51:50.510 --> 02:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
are in treatment that we're not going to
 
02:51:52.429 --> 02:51:52.439 align:start position:0%
want to cut off and that we want to
 
02:51:54.150 --> 02:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
interact with CMS so that we don't
 
02:51:57.870 --> 02:51:57.880 align:start position:0%
design something that uh that that isn't
 
02:52:00.070 --> 02:52:00.080 align:start position:0%
going to work from them compliantly and
 
02:52:01.670 --> 02:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that we're working
 
02:52:03.070 --> 02:52:03.080 align:start position:0%
from our end to make sure that we're
 
02:52:05.870 --> 02:52:05.880 align:start position:0%
being humanely implementing the policy
 
02:52:09.030 --> 02:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
um so I think the it's going to take a
 
02:52:10.630 --> 02:52:10.640 align:start position:0%
little bit of work to to get everything
 
02:52:12.550 --> 02:52:12.560 align:start position:0%
synchronized but there are certain
 
02:52:14.309 --> 02:52:14.319 align:start position:0%
children that we can't charge premiums
 
02:52:16.469 --> 02:52:16.479 align:start position:0%
for anybody below that
 
02:52:18.910 --> 02:52:18.920 align:start position:0%
25% there are other potential IAL
 
02:52:20.269 --> 02:52:20.279 align:start position:0%
children that have are in special
 
02:52:22.950 --> 02:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
eligibility groups that are excluded as
 
02:52:24.910 --> 02:52:24.920 align:start position:0%
well I think we we're estimating about
 
02:52:27.590 --> 02:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
8,600 children with would be subject to
 
02:52:30.309 --> 02:52:30.319 align:start position:0%
this just by historic terms I went back
 
02:52:32.990 --> 02:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
and looked at
 
02:52:36.389 --> 02:52:36.399 align:start position:0%
um uh the healthy kids Corporation um
 
02:52:37.670 --> 02:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
and just
 
02:52:40.349 --> 02:52:40.359 align:start position:0%
coincidentally um there were I think
 
02:52:43.469 --> 02:52:43.479 align:start position:0%
8,600 kids about that time paying
 
02:52:45.670 --> 02:52:45.680 align:start position:0%
premiums so it's I'm not saying they're
 
02:52:47.550 --> 02:52:47.560 align:start position:0%
Apples to Apples but they're at least in
 
02:52:49.910 --> 02:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
the same category fruit in terms of the
 
02:52:52.630 --> 02:52:52.640 align:start position:0%
number of people to be affected by
 
02:52:54.550 --> 02:52:54.560 align:start position:0%
premiums and
 
02:52:56.830 --> 02:52:56.840 align:start position:0%
co-pays representative walner for a
 
02:53:00.389 --> 02:53:00.399 align:start position:0%
question so I was wondering if you had
 
02:53:02.910 --> 02:53:02.920 align:start position:0%
would any consideration be given to a
 
02:53:06.030 --> 02:53:06.040 align:start position:0%
family where maybe the children were are
 
02:53:10.150 --> 02:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
on um Medicaid but the parent is
 
02:53:12.269 --> 02:53:12.279 align:start position:0%
purchasing health insurance for
 
02:53:14.630 --> 02:53:14.640 align:start position:0%
themselves I actually spoke to a woman
 
02:53:17.710 --> 02:53:17.720 align:start position:0%
the other day who is purchasing for
 
02:53:17.720 --> 02:53:19.349 align:start position:0%
the other day who is purchasing for
herself

02:53:19.349 --> 02:53:19.359 align:start position:0%
herself
 
02:53:22.830 --> 02:53:22.840 align:start position:0%
um a Marketplace product and I think she
 
02:53:24.429 --> 02:53:24.439 align:start position:0%
said she was paying
 
02:53:27.830 --> 02:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
$252 a month for it and the children are
 
02:53:31.269 --> 02:53:31.279 align:start position:0%
on Medicaid now because I'm sure she
 
02:53:34.110 --> 02:53:34.120 align:start position:0%
falls within this category now she's
 
02:53:36.910 --> 02:53:36.920 align:start position:0%
going to have to probably face
 
02:53:41.550 --> 02:53:41.560 align:start position:0%
another $2 to $300 for the
 
02:53:44.710 --> 02:53:44.720 align:start position:0%
children this puts this family is really
 
02:53:45.830 --> 02:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
02:53:48.550 --> 02:53:48.560 align:start position:0%
paying a large amount are we going to
 
02:53:50.229 --> 02:53:50.239 align:start position:0%
look at anything if they're already
 
02:53:52.510 --> 02:53:52.520 align:start position:0%
paying if they're already purchasing
 
02:53:54.670 --> 02:53:54.680 align:start position:0%
health insurance for someone else in the
 
02:53:58.229 --> 02:53:58.239 align:start position:0%
family so um I think we're looking at
 
02:54:00.630 --> 02:54:00.640 align:start position:0%
trying to you know like in private
 
02:54:02.469 --> 02:54:02.479 align:start position:0%
insurance right there's for family
 
02:54:04.550 --> 02:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
coverage sometimes you know there's a
 
02:54:07.429 --> 02:54:07.439 align:start position:0%
certain charge premium charge stops at a
 
02:54:09.710 --> 02:54:09.720 align:start position:0%
certain number of children or to have
 
02:54:11.269 --> 02:54:11.279 align:start position:0%
the second or third child at a different
 
02:54:13.469 --> 02:54:13.479 align:start position:0%
rate than the first child I think we we
 
02:54:17.229 --> 02:54:17.239 align:start position:0%
do want to try to calibrate this to to
 
02:54:20.229 --> 02:54:20.239 align:start position:0%
um be as
 
02:54:22.710 --> 02:54:22.720 align:start position:0%
uh sensitive as possible to the
 
02:54:24.950 --> 02:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
circumstances that particular example
 
02:54:27.469 --> 02:54:27.479 align:start position:0%
that you gave me was one that I hadn't
 
02:54:30.510 --> 02:54:30.520 align:start position:0%
thought about yet but you know we we do
 
02:54:32.870 --> 02:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
a good part of this public process is
 
02:54:35.269 --> 02:54:35.279 align:start position:0%
concerns can be raised and we can
 
02:54:36.950 --> 02:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
incorporate that in our thinking how to
 
02:54:41.269 --> 02:54:41.279 align:start position:0%
design it um but uh you know I think
 
02:54:43.070 --> 02:54:43.080 align:start position:0%
there's uh there's a number of different
 
02:54:45.150 --> 02:54:45.160 align:start position:0%
ways that we can you know structure the
 
02:54:48.070 --> 02:54:48.080 align:start position:0%
premiums um and it'd be interesting you
 
02:54:52.590 --> 02:54:52.600 align:start position:0%
know if you per chance if uh the example
 
02:54:54.990 --> 02:54:55.000 align:start position:0%
that you brought up if there are
 
02:54:56.750 --> 02:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
circumstances where sometimes can to be
 
02:54:59.750 --> 02:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
cheaper to have everybody on ACA
 
02:55:01.630 --> 02:55:01.640 align:start position:0%
coverage um when we were talking earlier
 
02:55:03.190 --> 02:55:03.200 align:start position:0%
about the number of people children that
 
02:55:06.950 --> 02:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
aren't on um it may be worthwhile in
 
02:55:08.670 --> 02:55:08.680 align:start position:0%
that particular instance to evaluate
 
02:55:10.510 --> 02:55:10.520 align:start position:0%
that with one of The Navigators as to
 
02:55:13.630 --> 02:55:13.640 align:start position:0%
whether um being all under ACA coverage
 
02:55:16.389 --> 02:55:16.399 align:start position:0%
as a family is less expensive than than
 
02:55:17.990 --> 02:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
doing it both ways I'm not saying that
 
02:55:19.790 --> 02:55:19.800 align:start position:0%
it is but those are the types of things
 
02:55:21.950 --> 02:55:21.960 align:start position:0%
that we need to you know work with the
 
02:55:23.950 --> 02:55:23.960 align:start position:0%
foundation for health communities who
 
02:55:27.269 --> 02:55:27.279 align:start position:0%
does um the navigate contract of you
 
02:55:29.030 --> 02:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
know trying to have that relationship to
 
02:55:31.030 --> 02:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
look at and try to help people make the
 
02:55:34.349 --> 02:55:34.359 align:start position:0%
best decision for themselves
 
02:55:37.550 --> 02:55:37.560 align:start position:0%
financially thank you representative tki
 
02:55:39.510 --> 02:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
for a question thank you um you just
 
02:55:40.910 --> 02:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
said something that triggered a question
 
02:55:42.870 --> 02:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
in my mind when we're talking about
 
02:55:46.550 --> 02:55:46.560 align:start position:0%
number of children so um when we talk
 
02:55:49.429 --> 02:55:49.439 align:start position:0%
about 5% of let's say that
 
02:55:52.990 --> 02:55:53.000 align:start position:0%
working mom who makes $67,000 a year and
 
02:55:56.910 --> 02:55:56.920 align:start position:0%
has two children um if she had four
 
02:55:59.070 --> 02:55:59.080 align:start position:0%
children like of these month of these
 
02:56:01.590 --> 02:56:01.600 align:start position:0%
premiums charged per child in the chip
 
02:56:04.349 --> 02:56:04.359 align:start position:0%
program or if she has four children is
 
02:56:06.830 --> 02:56:06.840 align:start position:0%
it the same amount family plan versus an
 
02:56:09.550 --> 02:56:09.560 align:start position:0%
individual plan for children so I'd like
 
02:56:12.870 --> 02:56:12.880 align:start position:0%
to in our design build in consideration
 
02:56:14.110 --> 02:56:14.120 align:start position:0%
for the number of children in a
 
02:56:17.190 --> 02:56:17.200 align:start position:0%
household and I think that we can um you
 
02:56:18.910 --> 02:56:18.920 align:start position:0%
know there's a certain
 
02:56:21.870 --> 02:56:21.880 align:start position:0%
um I mean that's what you do in in
 
02:56:23.950 --> 02:56:23.960 align:start position:0%
typically uh employment sponsored
 
02:56:26.950 --> 02:56:26.960 align:start position:0%
insurance right that there's that a one
 
02:56:28.910 --> 02:56:28.920 align:start position:0%
person plan versus a two person plan
 
02:56:32.910 --> 02:56:32.920 align:start position:0%
versus a family of plan based on certain
 
02:56:36.070 --> 02:56:36.080 align:start position:0%
numbers so I think that um to try to to
 
02:56:38.229 --> 02:56:38.239 align:start position:0%
look at the best we can on affordability
 
02:56:40.469 --> 02:56:40.479 align:start position:0%
is to to model some different structures
 
02:56:41.870 --> 02:56:41.880 align:start position:0%
we just haven't had the chance to do all
 
02:56:44.030 --> 02:56:44.040 align:start position:0%
that work yet I understand that I guess
 
02:56:45.790 --> 02:56:45.800 align:start position:0%
I'm just really concerned all of a
 
02:56:48.469 --> 02:56:48.479 align:start position:0%
sudden that um
 
02:56:50.429 --> 02:56:50.439 align:start position:0%
I wasn't into taking into account
 
02:56:52.269 --> 02:56:52.279 align:start position:0%
multiple children I just assumed that
 
02:56:52.279 --> 02:56:53.150 align:start position:0%
multiple children I just assumed that
the

02:56:53.150 --> 02:56:53.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:56:55.750 --> 02:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
5% would provide the coverage for
 
02:56:57.830 --> 02:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
everyone in the household that needed it
 
02:57:01.190 --> 02:57:01.200 align:start position:0%
that was eligible so the the the to
 
02:57:03.309 --> 02:57:03.319 align:start position:0%
Total that we could because it's based
 
02:57:05.710 --> 02:57:05.720 align:start position:0%
on family income not the child's income
 
02:57:08.229 --> 02:57:08.239 align:start position:0%
it's 5% is the total that we can collect
 
02:57:11.030 --> 02:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
from a particular family right is 5% of
 
02:57:13.309 --> 02:57:13.319 align:start position:0%
their income okay so I'm just wanting to
 
02:57:17.030 --> 02:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
clarify that it's 5% of my mom my
 
02:57:19.870 --> 02:57:19.880 align:start position:0%
hypothetical mom yeah um if she has one
 
02:57:21.950 --> 02:57:21.960 align:start position:0%
child no I take that back because we're
 
02:57:24.469 --> 02:57:24.479 align:start position:0%
talking about the $67,000 a year if she
 
02:57:26.630 --> 02:57:26.640 align:start position:0%
has two children or five children it's
 
02:57:29.110 --> 02:57:29.120 align:start position:0%
that $283 a month or however the math
 
02:57:31.870 --> 02:57:31.880 align:start position:0%
works yeah I mean I think the the way
 
02:57:33.710 --> 02:57:33.720 align:start position:0%
more way I'd say it from my perspective
 
02:57:36.550 --> 02:57:36.560 align:start position:0%
is I can't exceed 5% of the family's
 
02:57:38.429 --> 02:57:38.439 align:start position:0%
income okay I just want to make sure
 
02:57:39.750 --> 02:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
that I'm understanding that it's not
 
02:57:45.349 --> 02:57:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:50.950 --> 02:57:50.960 align:start position:0%
yeah okay moving on to section
 
02:57:55.030 --> 02:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
111 uh which is also on page
 
02:57:58.309 --> 02:57:58.319 align:start position:0%
52 uh this provision here the Department
 
02:57:59.590 --> 02:57:59.600 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services Medicaid
 
02:58:01.269 --> 02:58:01.279 align:start position:0%
Eligibility this directs the department
 
02:58:04.469 --> 02:58:04.479 align:start position:0%
to return to pre-public Health Emergency
 
02:58:08.389 --> 02:58:08.399 align:start position:0%
income verification standards and on the
 
02:58:10.070 --> 02:58:10.080 align:start position:0%
presentation slide that you have in
 
02:58:12.349 --> 02:58:12.359 align:start position:0%
front of you what you'll see from a
 
02:58:16.750 --> 02:58:16.760 align:start position:0%
general funds savings perspective is um
 
02:58:18.830 --> 02:58:18.840 align:start position:0%
uh almost
 
02:58:23.229 --> 02:58:23.239 align:start position:0%
um about almost around $17 million in
 
02:58:28.790 --> 02:58:28.800 align:start position:0%
general funds over the bium in in total
 
02:58:31.309 --> 02:58:31.319 align:start position:0%
savings as a result of that
 
02:58:35.750 --> 02:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
provision and that is the last direct
 
02:58:39.990 --> 02:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:42.070 --> 02:58:42.080 align:start position:0%
hb2 can I
 
02:58:45.229 --> 02:58:45.239 align:start position:0%
just representative tarki for a question
 
02:58:46.990 --> 02:58:47.000 align:start position:0%
what's the direct what line are we
 
02:58:49.870 --> 02:58:49.880 align:start position:0%
looking at on page 21 one that is that
 
02:58:53.670 --> 02:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
verification sure so the the line is not
 
02:58:56.950 --> 02:58:56.960 align:start position:0%
numbered but it is entitled Titan
 
02:58:59.269 --> 02:58:59.279 align:start position:0%
eligibility requirements and you'll see
 
02:58:59.279 --> 02:59:00.349 align:start position:0%
eligibility requirements and you'll see
the

02:59:00.349 --> 02:59:00.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:59:04.630 --> 02:59:04.640 align:start position:0%
5.72 5 5.71 two million in general funds
 
02:59:07.150 --> 02:59:07.160 align:start position:0%
in state fiscal year 26 and then the
 
02:59:12.150 --> 02:59:12.160 align:start position:0%
11.4 million in state fiscal year 27 um
 
02:59:15.630 --> 02:59:15.640 align:start position:0%
just just so folks are aware the the
 
02:59:17.630 --> 02:59:17.640 align:start position:0%
table that you're looking at there
 
02:59:20.950 --> 02:59:20.960 align:start position:0%
there's a few other reductions um up top
 
02:59:22.790 --> 02:59:22.800 align:start position:0%
you will see a couple of unfunded
 
02:59:26.510 --> 02:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
positions in resulting in in red Inc
 
02:59:28.469 --> 02:59:28.479 align:start position:0%
there and then you'll also see a million
 
02:59:32.229 --> 02:59:32.239 align:start position:0%
dollars each year in a a reduction to uh
 
02:59:33.750 --> 02:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
the standard Medicaid budget and
 
02:59:36.269 --> 02:59:36.279 align:start position:0%
accounting in at
 
02:59:39.309 --> 02:59:39.319 align:start position:0%
7948 and there is no hb2 provision tied
 
02:59:43.190 --> 02:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
to the unfunded positions or the uh
 
02:59:44.830 --> 02:59:44.840 align:start position:0%
reduction the reduction to standard
 
02:59:44.840 --> 02:59:48.150 align:start position:0%
reduction the reduction to standard
Medicaid

02:59:48.150 --> 02:59:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:49.269 --> 02:59:49.279 align:start position:0%
can I ask one more questions yes
 
02:59:51.389 --> 02:59:51.399 align:start position:0%
representative tki for a question Just
 
02:59:53.429 --> 02:59:53.439 align:start position:0%
for future reference when we are blur
 
02:59:55.229 --> 02:59:55.239 align:start position:0%
eyed in two weeks and looking at this
 
02:59:59.070 --> 02:59:59.080 align:start position:0%
page can you refer the lines here that
 
03:00:01.790 --> 03:00:01.800 align:start position:0%
correspond to the sections in hb2 do you

know what I'm saying like like I just
 
03:00:07.429 --> 03:00:07.439 align:start position:0%
wrote section 110 in hb2 is Chip premium
 
03:00:09.790 --> 03:00:09.800 align:start position:0%
that would be great we can reissue that
 
03:00:11.990 --> 03:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
exhibit with that on there or you can
 
03:00:14.950 --> 03:00:14.960 align:start position:0%
just do you have the can you do them
 
03:00:16.150 --> 03:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
right now looking at the sections or is

through from the top of the table down
 
03:00:26.030 --> 03:00:26.040 align:start position:0%
or numerically through hb2 top of the
 
03:00:27.510 --> 03:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
table down and we're just going to write
 
03:00:29.830 --> 03:00:29.840 align:start position:0%
them down okay so the first row is

earlier that has no corresponding hb2
 
03:00:55.910 --> 03:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
provision the preferred drug list
 
03:01:01.429 --> 03:01:01.439 align:start position:0%

anything or require any followup we'll
 
03:01:51.710 --> 03:01:51.720 align:start position:0%
be in touch and I know you have some
 
03:01:54.389 --> 03:01:54.399 align:start position:0%
follow-ups too so communication works
 
03:01:57.429 --> 03:01:57.439 align:start position:0%
both ways so thank you both very much
 
03:02:01.110 --> 03:02:01.120 align:start position:0%
thank you so it is 12: noon I do want to
 
03:02:02.870 --> 03:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
make mention that if anyone from the
 
03:02:04.950 --> 03:02:04.960 align:start position:0%
public would like to
 
03:02:08.269 --> 03:02:08.279 align:start position:0%
speak I would welcome
 
03:02:12.469 --> 03:02:12.479 align:start position:0%
you so why don't we begin that now if
 
03:02:14.510 --> 03:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
anyone from the public would like to
 
03:02:16.950 --> 03:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
speak on this continued work session on
 
03:02:19.469 --> 03:02:19.479 align:start position:0%
Medicaid please come
 
03:02:23.030 --> 03:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
forward if not we're going to close the
 
03:02:27.389 --> 03:02:27.399 align:start position:0%
work session for the day okay two more
 
03:02:31.269 --> 03:02:31.279 align:start position:0%
okay would the committee be all right to
 
03:02:34.990 --> 03:02:35.000 align:start position:0%
um hear these individuals out prior to
 
03:02:39.030 --> 03:02:39.040 align:start position:0%
our our break for lunch okay Qui so
 
03:02:42.110 --> 03:02:42.120 align:start position:0%
we're not going to reconvene after the
 
03:02:47.870 --> 03:02:47.880 align:start position:0%
afternoon discussion on FN 71 um if a
 
03:02:50.269 --> 03:02:50.279 align:start position:0%
group of people come in and want to
 
03:02:52.590 --> 03:02:52.600 align:start position:0%
testify then we will so we'll see how
 
03:02:55.870 --> 03:02:55.880 align:start position:0%
this public testimony goes and then um
 
03:02:57.469 --> 03:02:57.479 align:start position:0%
go from there so it's not correct to say
 
03:02:59.269 --> 03:02:59.279 align:start position:0%
we're necessarily adjourned for the day
 
03:03:00.710 --> 03:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
at this point that is correct I'll make
 
03:03:02.910 --> 03:03:02.920 align:start position:0%
that determination once our public
 
03:03:04.550 --> 03:03:04.560 align:start position:0%
participants have an opportunity to
 
03:03:07.110 --> 03:03:07.120 align:start position:0%
testify welcome to division three if you
 
03:03:08.710 --> 03:03:08.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't mind stating your name real
 
03:03:11.269 --> 03:03:11.279 align:start position:0%
clear and who you represent we would
 
03:03:13.229 --> 03:03:13.239 align:start position:0%
appreciate it welcome absolutely and
 
03:03:14.670 --> 03:03:14.680 align:start position:0%
I'll be very brief I know everyone wants
 
03:03:17.070 --> 03:03:17.080 align:start position:0%
to get to lunch um my name is Jake Barry
 
03:03:18.950 --> 03:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
I'm the vice president policy is add new
 
03:03:20.710 --> 03:03:20.720 align:start position:0%
Futures as many of you know new Futures
 
03:03:22.670 --> 03:03:22.680 align:start position:0%
is nonpartisan nonprofit Health policy
 
03:03:24.750 --> 03:03:24.760 align:start position:0%
and advocacy organization we've been
 
03:03:26.550 --> 03:03:26.560 align:start position:0%
working for nearly 30 years to increase
 
03:03:28.229 --> 03:03:28.239 align:start position:0%
access to quality affordable healthcare
 
03:03:30.910 --> 03:03:30.920 align:start position:0%
in our state uh just a quick comment
 
03:03:32.670 --> 03:03:32.680 align:start position:0%
regarding the Medicaid cost shares
 
03:03:34.790 --> 03:03:34.800 align:start position:0%
proposal that uh uh that that that Mr
 
03:03:37.950 --> 03:03:37.960 align:start position:0%
liman and others just just referred to
 
03:03:39.349 --> 03:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
uh I know we're awaiting more details
 
03:03:40.910 --> 03:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
but I think it's important to note that
 
03:03:43.469 --> 03:03:43.479 align:start position:0%
even modest cost shares proposed here uh
 
03:03:45.150 --> 03:03:45.160 align:start position:0%
or modest cost increases like those
 
03:03:46.750 --> 03:03:46.760 align:start position:0%
proposed here could have unintended
 
03:03:48.429 --> 03:03:48.439 align:start position:0%
consequences and could significantly
 
03:03:50.590 --> 03:03:50.600 align:start position:0%
impact uh access to care for many of our
 
03:03:51.630 --> 03:03:51.640 align:start position:0%
states most
 
03:03:53.990 --> 03:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
vulnerable uh research has repeatedly
 
03:03:55.950 --> 03:03:55.960 align:start position:0%
confirmed that cost shares like premiums
 
03:03:57.870 --> 03:03:57.880 align:start position:0%
and co-pays included in the budget are
 
03:03:59.269 --> 03:03:59.279 align:start position:0%
associated with reduced care and
 
03:04:00.990 --> 03:04:01.000 align:start position:0%
increased financial burden both for
 
03:04:02.910 --> 03:04:02.920 align:start position:0%
enrolled individuals and and families
 
03:04:06.070 --> 03:04:06.080 align:start position:0%
and the state as a whole in 2003 the
 
03:04:07.710 --> 03:04:07.720 align:start position:0%
state of Oregon implemented sliding
 
03:04:09.710 --> 03:04:09.720 align:start position:0%
scale premiums to enroll these below the
 
03:04:11.469 --> 03:04:11.479 align:start position:0%
federal poverty line in that first year
 
03:04:13.389 --> 03:04:13.399 align:start position:0%
enrollment drop by nearly half among the
 
03:04:15.790 --> 03:04:15.800 align:start position:0%
affected population of course these
 
03:04:17.910 --> 03:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
coverage declines contributed to the to
 
03:04:19.190 --> 03:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
delayed or missing care and
 
03:04:20.389 --> 03:04:20.399 align:start position:0%
significantly greater rates of
 
03:04:22.190 --> 03:04:22.200 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care which had cost
 
03:04:24.950 --> 03:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
impacts across the Health Care system in
 
03:04:26.349 --> 03:04:26.359 align:start position:0%
addition I think it's important to note
 
03:04:28.469 --> 03:04:28.479 align:start position:0%
that between lower enrollments and
 
03:04:30.309 --> 03:04:30.319 align:start position:0%
higher administrative costs cost sharing
 
03:04:32.750 --> 03:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
will likely not lead to to Savings in
 
03:04:35.790 --> 03:04:35.800 align:start position:0%
2016 Arkansas experienced a 30% jump in
 
03:04:37.630 --> 03:04:37.640 align:start position:0%
administrative cost associated with cost
 
03:04:40.510 --> 03:04:40.520 align:start position:0%
sharing uh in Montana they disconsidered
 
03:04:42.429 --> 03:04:42.439 align:start position:0%
discontinued two Provisions related to
 
03:04:44.070 --> 03:04:44.080 align:start position:0%
premiums after 2 years due to
 
03:04:46.750 --> 03:04:46.760 align:start position:0%
administrative and budgetary concerns uh
 
03:04:48.710 --> 03:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
we fear administrative cost associated
 
03:04:50.389 --> 03:04:50.399 align:start position:0%
with implementing these cost shares will
 
03:04:52.030 --> 03:04:52.040 align:start position:0%
cost the state more than it saves and
 
03:04:53.510 --> 03:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
then these initiatives will do little
 
03:04:55.670 --> 03:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
but in decrease access to care for those
 
03:04:58.110 --> 03:04:58.120 align:start position:0%
who need it increase uncompensated care
 
03:04:59.870 --> 03:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
and create greater cost pressures across
 
03:05:02.910 --> 03:05:02.920 align:start position:0%
the Health Care System uh with that I'm
 
03:05:04.309 --> 03:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions or thank you for
 
03:05:04.319 --> 03:05:05.429 align:start position:0%

Hawkins I'm here today representing Nami
 
03:05:47.429 --> 03:05:47.439 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the National Alliance on
 
03:05:49.910 --> 03:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
men mental illness I just want to open
 
03:05:52.030 --> 03:05:52.040 align:start position:0%
by saying on behalf of the individuals
 
03:05:54.030 --> 03:05:54.040 align:start position:0%
and families we serve we know that
 
03:05:56.229 --> 03:05:56.239 align:start position:0%
recovery is possible from mental illness
 
03:05:58.429 --> 03:05:58.439 align:start position:0%
and substance use disorders but only
 
03:06:01.030 --> 03:06:01.040 align:start position:0%
with access to the treatment people need
 
03:06:02.950 --> 03:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
as the largest paay of mental health and
 
03:06:04.950 --> 03:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder Services Medicaid
 
03:06:07.670 --> 03:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
is a Lifeline for nearly 200,000 Granite
 
03:06:10.429 --> 03:06:10.439 align:start position:0%
Staters through Medicaid coverage uh our
 
03:06:13.229 --> 03:06:13.239 align:start position:0%
folks uh access critical services like
 
03:06:15.150 --> 03:06:15.160 align:start position:0%
Psychotherapy inpatient treatment
 
03:06:17.590 --> 03:06:17.600 align:start position:0%
prescription medications and Crisis Care
 
03:06:19.429 --> 03:06:19.439 align:start position:0%
we have severe concerns that the
 
03:06:21.550 --> 03:06:21.560 align:start position:0%
proposed changes to the Medicaid Program
 
03:06:23.150 --> 03:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
implementing these policies that could
 
03:06:25.750 --> 03:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
increase cost burden on beneficiaries or
 
03:06:27.229 --> 03:06:27.239 align:start position:0%
create barriers to coverage would
 
03:06:29.150 --> 03:06:29.160 align:start position:0%
disproportionately harm our folks with
 
03:06:30.670 --> 03:06:30.680 align:start position:0%
mental health and substance use
 
03:06:32.590 --> 03:06:32.600 align:start position:0%
conditions here in the granite state and
 
03:06:34.910 --> 03:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
disc disconnect individuals and families
 
03:06:37.269 --> 03:06:37.279 align:start position:0%
from the care they need I've printed out
 
03:06:38.990 --> 03:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
a couple studies I I won't run through
 
03:06:40.710 --> 03:06:40.720 align:start position:0%
them in detail but I do want to hit a
 
03:06:43.510 --> 03:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
couple key points um according to the
 
03:06:45.830 --> 03:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
Kaiser Family Foundation premiums do
 
03:06:48.070 --> 03:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
serve as a barrier to obtaining and M
 
03:06:49.950 --> 03:06:49.960 align:start position:0%
maintaining Medicaid coverage among
 
03:06:52.670 --> 03:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
lowincome individuals and additionally
 
03:06:54.750 --> 03:06:54.760 align:start position:0%
even relatively small levels of cost
 
03:06:57.950 --> 03:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
sharing in the range of $1 to5 have been
 
03:07:00.630 --> 03:07:00.640 align:start position:0%
associated with reduced use of care uh
 
03:07:02.469 --> 03:07:02.479 align:start position:0%
cost sharing is also associated with
 
03:07:04.190 --> 03:07:04.200 align:start position:0%
worse health health outcomes and
 
03:07:06.349 --> 03:07:06.359 align:start position:0%
increased financial burden uh for
 
03:07:08.030 --> 03:07:08.040 align:start position:0%
example in one study after the
 
03:07:09.750 --> 03:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
implementation of co-pays for
 
03:07:11.870 --> 03:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs utilization
 
03:07:14.389 --> 03:07:14.399 align:start position:0%
significantly declined in another study
 
03:07:16.670 --> 03:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
for individuals with schizophrenia for
 
03:07:18.870 --> 03:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
every $1 increase in the prescription
 
03:07:20.710 --> 03:07:20.720 align:start position:0%
co- payment there was a reduction in the
 
03:07:23.150 --> 03:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
amount of medication fills and then I
 
03:07:25.349 --> 03:07:25.359 align:start position:0%
just want to note that uh we know that
 
03:07:27.550 --> 03:07:27.560 align:start position:0%
when parents have health insurance their
 
03:07:29.349 --> 03:07:29.359 align:start position:0%
children are more likely to be insured
 
03:07:32.510 --> 03:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
so uh really this is about impacting the
 
03:07:34.349 --> 03:07:34.359 align:start position:0%
entire family access to care for the
 
03:07:37.349 --> 03:07:37.359 align:start position:0%
entire family so the way we see it a lot
 
03:07:39.229 --> 03:07:39.239 align:start position:0%
of these proposed changes will only lead
 
03:07:41.229 --> 03:07:41.239 align:start position:0%
to decreases in coverage which will lead
 
03:07:43.150 --> 03:07:43.160 align:start position:0%
to decreases in access to care which
 
03:07:44.590 --> 03:07:44.600 align:start position:0%
will lead to worse mental health
 
03:07:46.630 --> 03:07:46.640 align:start position:0%
outcomes for individuals and family here
 
03:07:48.269 --> 03:07:48.279 align:start position:0%
in the granite state
 
03:07:49.790 --> 03:07:49.800 align:start position:0%
so uh for those reasons Nami New
 
03:07:51.550 --> 03:07:51.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire urges finance division 3 to
 
03:07:53.750 --> 03:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
exercise caution when considering uh
 
03:07:55.830 --> 03:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
these proposed changes especially cost
 
03:07:57.550 --> 03:07:57.560 align:start position:0%
sharing and premiums and really
 
03:07:59.750 --> 03:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
prioritize access to care and I thank
 
03:08:01.309 --> 03:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
you for your time and I will hand out
 
03:08:01.319 --> 03:08:03.190 align:start position:0%
you for your time and I will hand out
these

03:08:03.190 --> 03:08:03.200 align:start position:0%
these
 
03:08:06.229 --> 03:08:06.239 align:start position:0%
studies thank you thanks any questions
 
03:08:08.309 --> 03:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
for Mr
 
03:08:11.269 --> 03:08:11.279 align:start position:0%
Hawkins thank you all set thank
 
03:08:15.830 --> 03:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
you and next yes I think we're ready
 
03:08:19.670 --> 03:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:22.190 --> 03:08:22.200 align:start position:0%
okay all right if you could just welcome
 
03:08:24.269 --> 03:08:24.279 align:start position:0%
yes you know state your name clearly and
 
03:08:26.229 --> 03:08:26.239 align:start position:0%
who you represent would be appreciated
 
03:08:27.150 --> 03:08:27.160 align:start position:0%
yes thank you so much for the
 
03:08:28.990 --> 03:08:29.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity this my name is Don mckenny
 
03:08:30.269 --> 03:08:30.279 align:start position:0%
I work for New Hampshire legal
 
03:08:33.870 --> 03:08:33.880 align:start position:0%
assistance and I I want to try to um
 
03:08:35.110 --> 03:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
highlight a couple things without
 
03:08:37.510 --> 03:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
repeating everything that was just said
 
03:08:39.990 --> 03:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
by the previous um two folks who I
 
03:08:42.030 --> 03:08:42.040 align:start position:0%
completely support everything that they
 
03:08:45.670 --> 03:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
just mentioned um in terms of things
 
03:08:47.750 --> 03:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
like the fact that this essentially a
 
03:08:50.670 --> 03:08:50.680 align:start position:0%
lot of these changes will essentially um
 
03:08:53.389 --> 03:08:53.399 align:start position:0%
lead to churn in the Medicaid Program
 
03:08:55.550 --> 03:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
meaning people who are eligible for
 
03:08:58.870 --> 03:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
these programs will lose eligibility not
 
03:09:01.550 --> 03:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
because they're not poor not because
 
03:09:04.790 --> 03:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
they're not sick but because they fail
 
03:09:07.429 --> 03:09:07.439 align:start position:0%
to complete whatever document it is
 
03:09:09.510 --> 03:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
that's required that in the case of the
 
03:09:11.670 --> 03:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
passive renewals for example I'm sorry
 
03:09:14.389 --> 03:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
the expart renewals for example these
 
03:09:15.910 --> 03:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
things were put in place to make it
 
03:09:17.910 --> 03:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
easier both for the state employ where
 
03:09:19.510 --> 03:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
you've already heard yesterday we have a
 
03:09:22.670 --> 03:09:22.680 align:start position:0%
23% vacancy rate right so they're going
 
03:09:24.910 --> 03:09:24.920 align:start position:0%
to have to do more work which costs the
 
03:09:26.710 --> 03:09:26.720 align:start position:0%
state more money and puts more burden on
 
03:09:28.950 --> 03:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
state employees to do that work when we
 
03:09:30.269 --> 03:09:30.279 align:start position:0%
currently have these
 
03:09:33.870 --> 03:09:33.880 align:start position:0%
vacancies um and the the actual
 
03:09:37.389 --> 03:09:37.399 align:start position:0%
individuals um who are currently getting
 
03:09:40.750 --> 03:09:40.760 align:start position:0%
renewed um passively with this xte
 
03:09:43.750 --> 03:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
process it's because things like if you
 
03:09:47.950 --> 03:09:47.960 align:start position:0%
you know look on the the slide 15 um
 
03:09:50.910 --> 03:09:50.920 align:start position:0%
that was mentioned earlier removal of
 
03:09:54.110 --> 03:09:54.120 align:start position:0%
the Z employment income test that means
 
03:09:55.469 --> 03:09:55.479 align:start position:0%
essentially right
 
03:09:58.469 --> 03:09:58.479 align:start position:0%
now if if the database which they use
 
03:10:00.590 --> 03:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
that gets all collects all the income
 
03:10:02.670 --> 03:10:02.680 align:start position:0%
information says that someone has zero
 
03:10:05.790 --> 03:10:05.800 align:start position:0%
dollars like income currently they're
 
03:10:08.710 --> 03:10:08.720 align:start position:0%
allowed to renew them because they have
 
03:10:11.030 --> 03:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
zero income this would make them get
 
03:10:12.950 --> 03:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
documentation that that person has zero
 
03:10:14.830 --> 03:10:14.840 align:start position:0%
income that you know so we're putting
 
03:10:16.630 --> 03:10:16.640 align:start position:0%
things into place to make it harder for
 
03:10:21.190 --> 03:10:21.200 align:start position:0%
people to stay enrolled who are eligible
 
03:10:23.670 --> 03:10:23.680 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to kind of put a finer
 
03:10:25.870 --> 03:10:25.880 align:start position:0%
point on that
 
03:10:30.990 --> 03:10:31.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:33.670 --> 03:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
um again we've heard about the cost
 
03:10:36.190 --> 03:10:36.200 align:start position:0%
savings that are that the that will be
 
03:10:37.670 --> 03:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
associated with each of these policy
 
03:10:41.510 --> 03:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
changes in each B2 but I I would like
 
03:10:44.469 --> 03:10:44.479 align:start position:0%
clarification about whether they are
 
03:10:47.309 --> 03:10:47.319 align:start position:0%
these are gross or net savings mean
 
03:10:49.550 --> 03:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
meaning each of these changes also cost
 
03:10:55.870 --> 03:10:55.880 align:start position:0%
money um to do more uh work to make sure
 
03:10:59.510 --> 03:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
renewals are no longer done ex expar to
 
03:11:02.830 --> 03:11:02.840 align:start position:0%
implement a premium program to implement
 
03:11:05.229 --> 03:11:05.239 align:start position:0%
co-pays I mean um yeah the prescription
 
03:11:07.150 --> 03:11:07.160 align:start position:0%
drug co-pays all of those changes cost
 
03:11:10.349 --> 03:11:10.359 align:start position:0%
money to implement we know previous we
 
03:11:12.229 --> 03:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
when we did the work requirement it cost
 
03:11:17.429 --> 03:11:17.439 align:start position:0%
$4.4 million to implement um that wasn't
 
03:11:21.950 --> 03:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
actually uh that was frozen but we the
 
03:11:24.870 --> 03:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
state spent money to implement it um
 
03:11:26.469 --> 03:11:26.479 align:start position:0%
likewise there would be costs associated
 
03:11:28.550 --> 03:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
with implementing each of these changes
 
03:11:30.670 --> 03:11:30.680 align:start position:0%
and I haven't heard anything about those
 
03:11:31.950 --> 03:11:31.960 align:start position:0%
costs so I guess I just would like
 
03:11:34.510 --> 03:11:34.520 align:start position:0%
clarification whether gross or net here
 
03:11:36.590 --> 03:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
in terms of savings and I'd also like to
 
03:11:39.229 --> 03:11:39.239 align:start position:0%
know and I know I realize I'm asking you
 
03:11:40.990 --> 03:11:41.000 align:start position:0%
questions that you can't necessarily
 
03:11:43.389 --> 03:11:43.399 align:start position:0%
answer I guess they're just questions
 
03:11:45.910 --> 03:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
for your consideration as you consider
 
03:11:48.070 --> 03:11:48.080 align:start position:0%
these decisions in the budget
 
03:11:51.150 --> 03:11:51.160 align:start position:0%
how many people are expected to lose
 
03:11:53.030 --> 03:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
coverage based on each of these
 
03:11:56.389 --> 03:11:56.399 align:start position:0%
Provisions because um we've again talked
 
03:11:58.950 --> 03:11:58.960 align:start position:0%
about the cost savings well $12 million
 
03:12:01.790 --> 03:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
for for example for one of the cost CH
 
03:12:04.710 --> 03:12:04.720 align:start position:0%
premiums I think it was the $12 million
 
03:12:07.590 --> 03:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
represents money collected but it also
 
03:12:11.469 --> 03:12:11.479 align:start position:0%
represents um in in some way it it must
 
03:12:13.790 --> 03:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
represent people who lose coverage right
 
03:12:15.630 --> 03:12:15.640 align:start position:0%
like who are expected to lose coverage
 
03:12:18.269 --> 03:12:18.279 align:start position:0%
so that's a savings to the state
 
03:12:20.469 --> 03:12:20.479 align:start position:0%
um I just like to hear those numbers as
 
03:12:21.710 --> 03:12:21.720 align:start position:0%
well I think those are important to
 
03:12:23.269 --> 03:12:23.279 align:start position:0%
making an informed decision about each
 
03:12:25.590 --> 03:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
of these items and I'll stop there
 
03:12:27.429 --> 03:12:27.439 align:start position:0%
because I know you're probably as hungry
 
03:12:30.389 --> 03:12:30.399 align:start position:0%
as I am don't let that stop you though
 
03:12:33.590 --> 03:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
we I think that's I think I I think I
 
03:12:34.750 --> 03:12:34.760 align:start position:0%
covered what I wanted to cover okay
 
03:12:35.990 --> 03:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for bringing those things to
 
03:12:38.670 --> 03:12:38.680 align:start position:0%

04:01:13.950 --> 04:01:13.960 align:start position:0%
all right it's uh now 1:00 uh division 3
 
04:01:17.830 --> 04:01:17.840 align:start position:0%
work session is going to get started um
 
04:01:21.269 --> 04:01:21.279 align:start position:0%
we're here today to um
 
04:01:24.189 --> 04:01:24.199 align:start position:0%
rediscussed hopefully some conclusion
 
04:01:24.199 --> 04:01:26.429 align:start position:0%
rediscussed hopefully some conclusion
about

04:01:26.429 --> 04:01:26.439 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:01:31.429 --> 04:01:31.439 align:start position:0%
hp71 um uh there's been side talk of uh
 
04:01:34.269 --> 04:01:34.279 align:start position:0%
of a non-gain amendment being attached
 
04:01:37.309 --> 04:01:37.319 align:start position:0%
to this uh we can't talk about that
 
04:01:39.429 --> 04:01:39.439 align:start position:0%
today because it needs to go in front of
 
04:01:42.110 --> 04:01:42.120 align:start position:0%
a full another full finance committee
 
04:01:43.870 --> 04:01:43.880 align:start position:0%
hearing before we can really consider
 
04:01:46.790 --> 04:01:46.800 align:start position:0%
consider it as something we we we could
 
04:01:50.269 --> 04:01:50.279 align:start position:0%
or or that we might want to attach to
 
04:01:53.429 --> 04:01:53.439 align:start position:0%
hp71 so for the purposes of
 
04:01:57.790 --> 04:01:57.800 align:start position:0%
today uh HB 71 is kind of a standalone
 
04:02:00.910 --> 04:02:00.920 align:start position:0%
Bill and and and uh and that's all we're
 
04:02:03.229 --> 04:02:03.239 align:start position:0%
doing uh do we have a motion so we can
 
04:02:05.750 --> 04:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
begin a
 
04:02:09.070 --> 04:02:09.080 align:start position:0%
discussion yes so representative Daniels
 
04:02:14.870 --> 04:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
moves ought to pass is there a second
 
04:02:17.189 --> 04:02:17.199 align:start position:0%
uh seconded by
 
04:02:17.199 --> 04:02:18.990 align:start position:0%
uh seconded by
representative

04:02:18.990 --> 04:02:19.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:02:22.510 --> 04:02:22.520 align:start position:0%
Nano um uh do you do you want to start
 
04:02:24.670 --> 04:02:24.680 align:start position:0%
the discussion representative Daniels do
 
04:02:26.149 --> 04:02:26.159 align:start position:0%
what what what are your what are your
 
04:02:28.950 --> 04:02:28.960 align:start position:0%
thoughts on on this bill we don't we
 
04:02:31.750 --> 04:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
don't have anyone from the policy side
 
04:02:34.870 --> 04:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
of this we I know that the vice chair
 
04:02:38.309 --> 04:02:38.319 align:start position:0%
made good efforts uh to encourage a
 
04:02:41.309 --> 04:02:41.319 align:start position:0%
policy person to be here um but that
 
04:02:43.550 --> 04:02:43.560 align:start position:0%
just didn't happen everyone is just busy
 
04:02:47.710 --> 04:02:47.720 align:start position:0%
I guess guess so um so with that uh I
 
04:02:49.990 --> 04:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
think we can discuss this amongst
 
04:02:52.070 --> 04:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
ourselves or have
 
04:02:54.750 --> 04:02:54.760 align:start position:0%
to I I don't really have much more to
 
04:02:57.469 --> 04:02:57.479 align:start position:0%
add Ian we discussed this once before
 
04:02:59.950 --> 04:02:59.960 align:start position:0%
yeah and um so I don't think I have
 
04:03:02.590 --> 04:03:02.600 align:start position:0%
really anything more to add than what I
 
04:03:06.750 --> 04:03:06.760 align:start position:0%
did back then all right um so so I go
 
04:03:09.030 --> 04:03:09.040 align:start position:0%
ahead representa Moy thank you Mr
 
04:03:12.349 --> 04:03:12.359 align:start position:0%
chairman so just as a refresher this
 
04:03:15.710 --> 04:03:15.720 align:start position:0%
bill on the published do ET came out of
 
04:03:17.750 --> 04:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
Education policy and
 
04:03:19.870 --> 04:03:19.880 align:start position:0%
administration it was recommended ought
 
04:03:22.030 --> 04:03:22.040 align:start position:0%
to pass by that committee with a vote of
 
04:03:23.189 --> 04:03:23.199 align:start position:0%
10 to
 
04:03:26.149 --> 04:03:26.159 align:start position:0%
7 and then an ought to pass
 
04:03:29.550 --> 04:03:29.560 align:start position:0%
recommendation for the Full House roll
 
04:03:29.560 --> 04:03:31.149 align:start position:0%
recommendation for the Full House roll
call

04:03:31.149 --> 04:03:31.159 align:start position:0%
call
 
04:03:36.870 --> 04:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:39.309 --> 04:03:39.319 align:start position:0%
146 yeah that's why we got it we don't
 
04:03:41.389 --> 04:03:41.399 align:start position:0%
get the ones that
 
04:03:46.469 --> 04:03:46.479 align:start position:0%
fail um okay so I I think when I'm
 
04:03:50.269 --> 04:03:50.279 align:start position:0%
hearing you uh do that summary um
 
04:03:53.189 --> 04:03:53.199 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney that um
 
04:03:56.309 --> 04:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
essentially the the the policy decision
 
04:03:58.309 --> 04:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
has been made by the house that position
 
04:04:01.910 --> 04:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
has been taken um is there is there any
 
04:04:06.189 --> 04:04:06.199 align:start position:0%
discussion on wanting to to readdress
 
04:04:09.110 --> 04:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
the policy although it's been kind of
 
04:04:11.710 --> 04:04:11.720 align:start position:0%
settled at this point you have your mic
 
04:04:14.030 --> 04:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
on I don't know if you have a comment I
 
04:04:16.630 --> 04:04:16.640 align:start position:0%
do but you're you're it doesn't address
 
04:04:19.710 --> 04:04:19.720 align:start position:0%
the question you just asked oh um but
 
04:04:21.429 --> 04:04:21.439 align:start position:0%
addresses the bill so so we'll do
 
04:04:23.349 --> 04:04:23.359 align:start position:0%
whatever you have to say and then we can
 
04:04:27.630 --> 04:04:27.640 align:start position:0%
come back sure I um uh thank you not not
 
04:04:29.790 --> 04:04:29.800 align:start position:0%
addressing the underlying policy itself
 
04:04:33.149 --> 04:04:33.159 align:start position:0%
but we did hear some uh particularly
 
04:04:33.159 --> 04:04:34.469 align:start position:0%
but we did hear some uh particularly
potentially

04:04:34.469 --> 04:04:34.479 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
04:04:38.990 --> 04:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
alarming testimony that um that
 
04:04:42.389 --> 04:04:42.399 align:start position:0%
implementation taking the position uh as
 
04:04:43.910 --> 04:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire on the this
 
04:04:46.830 --> 04:04:46.840 align:start position:0%
bill uh May conflict with with Federal
 
04:04:49.309 --> 04:04:49.319 align:start position:0%
guidance and put uh Financial monies
 
04:04:52.030 --> 04:04:52.040 align:start position:0%
that we receive uh from the uh
 
04:04:53.389 --> 04:04:53.399 align:start position:0%
Department of Housing and Urban
 
04:04:57.550 --> 04:04:57.560 align:start position:0%
Development at risk and it um uh and I
 
04:05:00.389 --> 04:05:00.399 align:start position:0%
think there's a tradeoff between uh
 
04:05:03.110 --> 04:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
having you know addressing this
 
04:05:05.950 --> 04:05:05.960 align:start position:0%
relatively rare circumstances that's
 
04:05:08.189 --> 04:05:08.199 align:start position:0%
talked about in the bill versus a a
 
04:05:11.309 --> 04:05:11.319 align:start position:0%
fairly significant uh source of State
 
04:05:15.070 --> 04:05:15.080 align:start position:0%
funds and I I just didn't see see the
 
04:05:17.870 --> 04:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
need for this bill given given uh the
 
04:05:20.550 --> 04:05:20.560 align:start position:0%
the testimony that was uniquely provided
 
04:05:22.550 --> 04:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
here to the finance committee right so
 
04:05:27.429 --> 04:05:27.439 align:start position:0%
so um if I may I I um I everything you
 
04:05:30.389 --> 04:05:30.399 align:start position:0%
just said was accurate I I I think what
 
04:05:32.750 --> 04:05:32.760 align:start position:0%
you said is necessary I I don't view it
 
04:05:35.229 --> 04:05:35.239 align:start position:0%
as being sufficient to the discussion
 
04:05:37.910 --> 04:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
around the fiscal note though I I I
 
04:05:41.469 --> 04:05:41.479 align:start position:0%
think the testimony was was um I my
 
04:05:43.349 --> 04:05:43.359 align:start position:0%
interpretation was that it was fairly
 
04:05:46.269 --> 04:05:46.279 align:start position:0%
clear clear that what was laid out in
 
04:05:48.510 --> 04:05:48.520 align:start position:0%
the in the fiscal note was the worst
 
04:05:52.630 --> 04:05:52.640 align:start position:0%
case and that when I asked uh the the
 
04:05:54.389 --> 04:05:54.399 align:start position:0%
the the person from the Department who
 
04:05:54.399 --> 04:05:55.510 align:start position:0%
the the person from the Department who
was

04:05:55.510 --> 04:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:05:58.870 --> 04:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
testifying what the best case may be or
 
04:06:02.309 --> 04:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
what the most likely probable case is I
 
04:06:05.830 --> 04:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
I I I believe her answer was that uh she
 
04:06:07.550 --> 04:06:07.560 align:start position:0%
didn't really think about it she hadn't
 
04:06:09.950 --> 04:06:09.960 align:start position:0%
really thought about it and then in
 
04:06:12.990 --> 04:06:13.000 align:start position:0%
discussion I I I asked her you know is
 
04:06:15.349 --> 04:06:15.359 align:start position:0%
it probably is zero is that the best
 
04:06:16.870 --> 04:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
case that this is going to have no
 
04:06:20.070 --> 04:06:20.080 align:start position:0%
impact and uh and I think she after I
 
04:06:22.429 --> 04:06:22.439 align:start position:0%
asked her the question that way she
 
04:06:24.790 --> 04:06:24.800 align:start position:0%
accepted that that was in indeed a
 
04:06:26.469 --> 04:06:26.479 align:start position:0%
possibility that that's the way I
 
04:06:30.670 --> 04:06:30.680 align:start position:0%
remember it but um um is there
 
04:06:30.680 --> 04:06:32.269 align:start position:0%
remember it but um um is there
representative

04:06:32.269 --> 04:06:32.279 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:06:34.870 --> 04:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
tki I had a different comment I shut it
 
04:06:36.429 --> 04:06:36.439 align:start position:0%
off in case anyone else wanted to
 
04:06:39.349 --> 04:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
respond okay do we want to keep
 
04:06:39.359 --> 04:06:41.189 align:start position:0%
respond okay do we want to keep
representative

04:06:41.189 --> 04:06:41.199 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:06:44.830 --> 04:06:44.840 align:start position:0%
seaworth thank you Mr chairman
 
04:06:48.349 --> 04:06:48.359 align:start position:0%
um when I was in in that and listening
 
04:06:49.510 --> 04:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
to the
 
04:06:49.520 --> 04:06:51.550 align:start position:0%
to the
explanation

04:06:51.550 --> 04:06:51.560 align:start position:0%
explanation
 
04:06:54.550 --> 04:06:54.560 align:start position:0%
um I interpreted some of the statements
 
04:06:57.309 --> 04:06:57.319 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe read into them the
 
04:07:03.790 --> 04:07:03.800 align:start position:0%
explanation as to why the worst case was
 
04:07:08.030 --> 04:07:08.040 align:start position:0%
considered um was that they didn't
 
04:07:12.269 --> 04:07:12.279 align:start position:0%
understand the meaning of the words as
 
04:07:15.950 --> 04:07:15.960 align:start position:0%
written uh which right I found a little
 
04:07:19.070 --> 04:07:19.080 align:start position:0%
frustrating because there words that are
 
04:07:22.149 --> 04:07:22.159 align:start position:0%
defined in federal law and the reference
 
04:07:24.870 --> 04:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
is very explicit to the federal law
 
04:07:26.469 --> 04:07:26.479 align:start position:0%
right so
 
04:07:29.269 --> 04:07:29.279 align:start position:0%
the the basis upon which she Drew her
 
04:07:32.309 --> 04:07:32.319 align:start position:0%
conclusion was based on an incorrect
 
04:07:35.710 --> 04:07:35.720 align:start position:0%
definition there there's a very specific
 
04:07:38.830 --> 04:07:38.840 align:start position:0%
subset of people that are refer to and
 
04:07:41.790 --> 04:07:41.800 align:start position:0%
the testimony was that well I'm not sure
 
04:07:44.189 --> 04:07:44.199 align:start position:0%
what that means it could be everybody
 
04:07:47.349 --> 04:07:47.359 align:start position:0%
and if it's everybody then that would be
 
04:07:48.590 --> 04:07:48.600 align:start position:0%
illegal and
 
04:07:50.790 --> 04:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional in which case we could
 
04:07:54.510 --> 04:07:54.520 align:start position:0%
lose all our money and I I think that
 
04:07:57.030 --> 04:07:57.040 align:start position:0%
ignores the ability to Simply look at
 
04:08:00.229 --> 04:08:00.239 align:start position:0%
the definitions and they're not the law
 
04:08:03.510 --> 04:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
isn't complicated in this case simply
 
04:08:06.070 --> 04:08:06.080 align:start position:0%
review um is there any comment more on
 
04:08:08.830 --> 04:08:08.840 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note because if there if if
 
04:08:10.550 --> 04:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
the members don't have one i' I'd like
 
04:08:13.510 --> 04:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
to ask Mr Ripple who got you this is a
 
04:08:15.269 --> 04:08:15.279 align:start position:0%
little unusual but you were involved
 
04:08:19.670 --> 04:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
from the LDA LBA perspective on uh
 
04:08:22.670 --> 04:08:22.680 align:start position:0%
developing this fiscal note I believe do
 
04:08:25.550 --> 04:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
you have any deeper context to share
 
04:08:28.070 --> 04:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
with us that we haven't already
 
04:08:30.429 --> 04:08:30.439 align:start position:0%
discussed I don't think so I had already
 
04:08:33.630 --> 04:08:33.640 align:start position:0%
distributed the uh the exact line items
 
04:08:35.550 --> 04:08:35.560 align:start position:0%
and amounts that HHS was referencing
 
04:08:37.030 --> 04:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
sort of generally when they gave me that
 
04:08:39.030 --> 04:08:39.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal note information I will just make
 
04:08:40.790 --> 04:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
one other General comment which is it's
 
04:08:44.309 --> 04:08:44.319 align:start position:0%
fairly typical um when HHS provides a
 
04:08:48.429 --> 04:08:48.439 align:start position:0%
response to a bill um that has some
 
04:08:51.590 --> 04:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
bearing on federal law they will often
 
04:08:55.389 --> 04:08:55.399 align:start position:0%
say that in the extreme case or in the
 
04:08:57.830 --> 04:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
worst case scenario this bill if passed
 
04:09:00.269 --> 04:09:00.279 align:start position:0%
May jeopardize federal funds of X dollar
 
04:09:03.229 --> 04:09:03.239 align:start position:0%
so that's not an uncommon response from
 
04:09:04.990 --> 04:09:05.000 align:start position:0%
HHS all
 
04:09:07.830 --> 04:09:07.840 align:start position:0%
right represent lurki what whatever you
 
04:09:11.550 --> 04:09:11.560 align:start position:0%
care to say go for it wow well get
 
04:09:14.149 --> 04:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
ready um
 
04:09:16.830 --> 04:09:16.840 align:start position:0%
no I guess what I'm hearing in the uh
 
04:09:18.910 --> 04:09:18.920 align:start position:0%
the weaknesses in the fiscal note
 
04:09:22.429 --> 04:09:22.439 align:start position:0%
pertains a lot to the specific language
 
04:09:25.149 --> 04:09:25.159 align:start position:0%
and the definitions in the bill um I
 
04:09:27.590 --> 04:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
think we asked a lot of questions about
 
04:09:29.429 --> 04:09:29.439 align:start position:0%
what does this mean what does that mean
 
04:09:32.189 --> 04:09:32.199 align:start position:0%
and the reality is there was not a clear
 
04:09:35.429 --> 04:09:35.439 align:start position:0%
answer and while I'd like to Simply say
 
04:09:36.870 --> 04:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the fiscal note to make
 
04:09:39.590 --> 04:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
my decision I'm looking at the the
 
04:09:42.870 --> 04:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
language of the bill and I believe it is
 
04:09:45.030 --> 04:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
poorly written unfortunately and so I
 
04:09:46.990 --> 04:09:47.000 align:start position:0%
cannot support an ought to pass motion
 
04:09:50.030 --> 04:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
on the bill because it's connected to a
 
04:09:52.750 --> 04:09:52.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal note that doesn't make any sense
 
04:09:55.189 --> 04:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
so I won't be supporting the a to pass I
 
04:09:57.990 --> 04:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
I think I think I actually share a
 
04:10:00.710 --> 04:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
portion of your observation there um and
 
04:10:04.070 --> 04:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
I spent some time talking to the sponsor
 
04:10:07.429 --> 04:10:07.439 align:start position:0%
uh and a co-sponsor about uh potential
 
04:10:11.309 --> 04:10:11.319 align:start position:0%
Amendment to the policy aspect of it and
 
04:10:14.670 --> 04:10:14.680 align:start position:0%
um the strong preference of the of the
 
04:10:19.229 --> 04:10:19.239 align:start position:0%
um of the Prime sponsor was uh uh let's
 
04:10:21.670 --> 04:10:21.680 align:start position:0%
not do any more changes in the house and
 
04:10:24.429 --> 04:10:24.439 align:start position:0%
the extent that it may need an amendment
 
04:10:26.109 --> 04:10:26.119 align:start position:0%
or somebody might want an amendment
 
04:10:30.990 --> 04:10:31.000 align:start position:0%
defer it to the Senate and I I don't um
 
04:10:34.510 --> 04:10:34.520 align:start position:0%
I I I'm I'm okay with the supporting the
 
04:10:37.830 --> 04:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
uh sponsors desire there and if I may
 
04:10:39.750 --> 04:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
the fact that the sponsor has not not
 
04:10:41.590 --> 04:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
once come before this committee to help
 
04:10:43.429 --> 04:10:43.439 align:start position:0%
answer our questions I find extremely
 
04:10:44.910 --> 04:10:44.920 align:start position:0%
frustrating and I believe that that's
 
04:10:46.870 --> 04:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
bad governance to P push this through to
 
04:10:48.469 --> 04:10:48.479 align:start position:0%
the Senate and hope that someone else
 
04:10:49.870 --> 04:10:49.880 align:start position:0%
changes it so again I'm going to be
 
04:10:52.670 --> 04:10:52.680 align:start position:0%
voting now I I respect your opinion and
 
04:10:54.269 --> 04:10:54.279 align:start position:0%
and it's really not all that different
 
04:10:58.189 --> 04:10:58.199 align:start position:0%
than my own if you truth be told so uh
 
04:11:00.910 --> 04:11:00.920 align:start position:0%
representative priest thank you Mr
 
04:11:04.469 --> 04:11:04.479 align:start position:0%
chairman welcome back I also share the
 
04:11:06.590 --> 04:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
same opinion as
 
04:11:11.030 --> 04:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
my uh representative across the uh room
 
04:11:14.309 --> 04:11:14.319 align:start position:0%
um there is no problem in New Hampshire
 
04:11:17.229 --> 04:11:17.239 align:start position:0%
there has been no problem in New
 
04:11:20.070 --> 04:11:20.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this is not a
 
04:11:24.990 --> 04:11:25.000 align:start position:0%
problem this is something that is we
 
04:11:27.750 --> 04:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be looking at
 
04:11:31.030 --> 04:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
because number one it's not a problem
 
04:11:34.309 --> 04:11:34.319 align:start position:0%
and why are we even entertaining
 
04:11:37.510 --> 04:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
this I I I think in discussions with the
 
04:11:41.550 --> 04:11:41.560 align:start position:0%
sponsor though this has been an issue in
 
04:11:44.070 --> 04:11:44.080 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts which is next next door to
 
04:11:48.670 --> 04:11:48.680 align:start position:0%
us so it it's it's not a totally foreign
 
04:11:52.070 --> 04:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
idea but but Mr Mr chairman I appreciate
 
04:11:54.389 --> 04:11:54.399 align:start position:0%
that but if this was a problem in
 
04:11:56.510 --> 04:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts why would wasn't the
 
04:12:00.070 --> 04:12:00.080 align:start position:0%
sponsor here to give us this information
 
04:12:03.309 --> 04:12:03.319 align:start position:0%
she wasn't here at all and so we have
 
04:12:07.229 --> 04:12:07.239 align:start position:0%
vague language we're going in with a um
 
04:12:10.189 --> 04:12:10.199 align:start position:0%
fiscal note that may or may not be
 
04:12:13.870 --> 04:12:13.880 align:start position:0%
devastating to our communities and
 
04:12:13.880 --> 04:12:16.070 align:start position:0%
devastating to our communities and
and

04:12:16.070 --> 04:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:12:19.910 --> 04:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
um I I can't vote on it yeah well you
 
04:12:22.630 --> 04:12:22.640 align:start position:0%
can vote you can't I can I can vote I
 
04:12:25.269 --> 04:12:25.279 align:start position:0%
can vote I'm opposed to this and and and
 
04:12:28.550 --> 04:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
I yes no I I I hear you yeah uh
 
04:12:30.510 --> 04:12:30.520 align:start position:0%
representative stringam so one of the
 
04:12:33.630 --> 04:12:33.640 align:start position:0%
one of the things that that I heard or
 
04:12:35.309 --> 04:12:35.319 align:start position:0%
uh what I believe I heard was talking
 
04:12:38.349 --> 04:12:38.359 align:start position:0%
about the 72 hours in the bill so
 
04:12:40.510 --> 04:12:40.520 align:start position:0%
basically you know you have an emergency
 
04:12:42.349 --> 04:12:42.359 align:start position:0%
shelter you use a school schools are
 
04:12:44.630 --> 04:12:44.640 align:start position:0%
great they're available able low cost
 
04:12:45.630 --> 04:12:45.640 align:start position:0%
for those
 
04:12:48.469 --> 04:12:48.479 align:start position:0%
circumstances but on within 72 hours you
 
04:12:50.590 --> 04:12:50.600 align:start position:0%
have to have some method of
 
04:12:53.109 --> 04:12:53.119 align:start position:0%
verifying uh the resident status of
 
04:12:55.710 --> 04:12:55.720 align:start position:0%
everybody who's in there and uh if you
 
04:12:57.790 --> 04:12:57.800 align:start position:0%
don't do it adequately that's the then
 
04:12:59.389 --> 04:12:59.399 align:start position:0%
the worst case scenario comes through
 
04:13:02.269 --> 04:13:02.279 align:start position:0%
you lose funds I think one of one of the
 
04:13:04.590 --> 04:13:04.600 align:start position:0%
things a responsible government might do
 
04:13:06.990 --> 04:13:07.000 align:start position:0%
in re in response to this is no longer
 
04:13:09.630 --> 04:13:09.640 align:start position:0%
use schools as emergency shelter so what
 
04:13:13.550 --> 04:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
we'd have available is uh more expensive
 
04:13:17.149 --> 04:13:17.159 align:start position:0%
yeah maybe less quality schools um uh
 
04:13:20.149 --> 04:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
because that's just such an honorous uh
 
04:13:22.950 --> 04:13:22.960 align:start position:0%
own onerous thing to prove that
 
04:13:25.830 --> 04:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
everybody who was in there on the 73rd
 
04:13:29.990 --> 04:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
hour is um is there so so and and that's
 
04:13:32.950 --> 04:13:32.960 align:start position:0%
that's real real cost to the budget and
 
04:13:35.309 --> 04:13:35.319 align:start position:0%
to this to the state to do that so yes
 
04:13:38.349 --> 04:13:38.359 align:start position:0%
sir can can I respond to that sure uh
 
04:13:42.269 --> 04:13:42.279 align:start position:0%
okay so um so you've suggested an
 
04:13:46.309 --> 04:13:46.319 align:start position:0%
alternative policy position um and
 
04:13:48.389 --> 04:13:48.399 align:start position:0%
unless you have an amendment for us to
 
04:13:50.670 --> 04:13:50.680 align:start position:0%
debate I I don't know that we should be
 
04:13:52.990 --> 04:13:53.000 align:start position:0%
amending the policy I mean you've got a
 
04:13:53.000 --> 04:13:53.830 align:start position:0%
amending the policy I mean you've got a
good

04:13:53.830 --> 04:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
good
 
04:13:59.950 --> 04:13:59.960 align:start position:0%
perspective um but um I think having uh
 
04:14:04.070 --> 04:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
planned for Emergency Operations before
 
04:14:07.349 --> 04:14:07.359 align:start position:0%
uh to your point schools with
 
04:14:10.469 --> 04:14:10.479 align:start position:0%
gymnasiums are a beautiful thing and the
 
04:14:14.389 --> 04:14:14.399 align:start position:0%
closer they are to the impact Ed people
 
04:14:16.389 --> 04:14:16.399 align:start position:0%
kind of the better proximity matters in
 
04:14:20.109 --> 04:14:20.119 align:start position:0%
a disaster right so I I don't know if if
 
04:14:22.030 --> 04:14:22.040 align:start position:0%
it were a separate policy debate if
 
04:14:23.950 --> 04:14:23.960 align:start position:0%
there were an amendment like that I I
 
04:14:25.750 --> 04:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
don't know that I would want to take it
 
04:14:28.469 --> 04:14:28.479 align:start position:0%
out of the hands of the local people to
 
04:14:31.630 --> 04:14:31.640 align:start position:0%
use an emergency shelter operation for
 
04:14:35.189 --> 04:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
72 hours and and and and and and and
 
04:14:38.229 --> 04:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
again no having seen these kind of plans
 
04:14:41.830 --> 04:14:41.840 align:start position:0%
before u a a law enforcement component
 
04:14:44.309 --> 04:14:44.319 align:start position:0%
is typically associated ated so even
 
04:14:46.510 --> 04:14:46.520 align:start position:0%
during that first 72 hours without
 
04:14:50.149 --> 04:14:50.159 align:start position:0%
identification of you know potential um
 
04:14:53.349 --> 04:14:53.359 align:start position:0%
uh human threats to the rest of them uh
 
04:14:55.750 --> 04:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
there would typically be some law
 
04:14:59.070 --> 04:14:59.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement capability to um maintain
 
04:15:01.910 --> 04:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
good order and discipline
 
04:15:05.349 --> 04:15:05.359 align:start position:0%
um give them 72 hours to sort sort it
 
04:15:08.229 --> 04:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
out um that's that would be my point of
 
04:15:10.070 --> 04:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
view representative
 
04:15:13.070 --> 04:15:13.080 align:start position:0%
seaworth thank you Mr chairman I want to
 
04:15:16.910 --> 04:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
kind of offer a counter um I in fact
 
04:15:21.149 --> 04:15:21.159 align:start position:0%
find this language very clear and and
 
04:15:26.510 --> 04:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
very specific uh extremely narrow in its
 
04:15:30.389 --> 04:15:30.399 align:start position:0%
scope and impact um I'm not saying this
 
04:15:35.109 --> 04:15:35.119 align:start position:0%
is I think the language is is perfect um
 
04:15:35.119 --> 04:15:37.109 align:start position:0%
is I think the language is is perfect um
but

04:15:37.109 --> 04:15:37.119 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:15:41.030 --> 04:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
I my vote would be determined by the
 
04:15:43.910 --> 04:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
opposite not saying well this looks like
 
04:15:45.229 --> 04:15:45.239 align:start position:0%
you know who knows what's going to
 
04:15:47.269 --> 04:15:47.279 align:start position:0%
happen and it's it's certainly going to
 
04:15:49.630 --> 04:15:49.640 align:start position:0%
be a disaster I think when you look at
 
04:15:51.469 --> 04:15:51.479 align:start position:0%
the when you actually read through
 
04:15:53.389 --> 04:15:53.399 align:start position:0%
everything understand it and look at
 
04:15:54.550 --> 04:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
when it would
 
04:15:57.070 --> 04:15:57.080 align:start position:0%
apply maybe to your point maybe it
 
04:15:59.710 --> 04:15:59.720 align:start position:0%
hardly it's almost impossible that it
 
04:16:05.990 --> 04:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:08.429 --> 04:16:08.439 align:start position:0%
comfortable deciding for myself that
 
04:16:11.109 --> 04:16:11.119 align:start position:0%
these worst case scenarios simply are
 
04:16:13.550 --> 04:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
not possible so I don't want to put
 
04:16:15.269 --> 04:16:15.279 align:start position:0%
words in your mouth you would be prone
 
04:16:19.710 --> 04:16:19.720 align:start position:0%
to to voting OTP and and and basically
 
04:16:22.950 --> 04:16:22.960 align:start position:0%
um not disregarding but um
 
04:16:25.070 --> 04:16:25.080 align:start position:0%
contextualizing the fiscal note to a
 
04:16:26.910 --> 04:16:26.920 align:start position:0%
point where you're not really concerned
 
04:16:28.870 --> 04:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
about its
 
04:16:32.469 --> 04:16:32.479 align:start position:0%
relevance yes all right and do you mind
 
04:16:34.870 --> 04:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
sharing with us why you may have a
 
04:16:36.990 --> 04:16:37.000 align:start position:0%
slightly better insight into this
 
04:16:39.070 --> 04:16:39.080 align:start position:0%
immigration issue than the rest of us
 
04:16:41.389 --> 04:16:41.399 align:start position:0%
you don't have to I I know we've talked
 
04:16:44.790 --> 04:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
and you you you have a a better Source
 
04:16:47.070 --> 04:16:47.080 align:start position:0%
than I do I I probably shouldn't all
 
04:16:52.429 --> 04:16:52.439 align:start position:0%
right no problem I'll I'll I I probably
 
04:16:53.710 --> 04:16:53.720 align:start position:0%
shouldn't because I don't think it's
 
04:16:56.469 --> 04:16:56.479 align:start position:0%
relevant my what what everything I said
 
04:16:59.429 --> 04:16:59.439 align:start position:0%
is based on reading the bill and reading
 
04:17:02.269 --> 04:17:02.279 align:start position:0%
the the federal law so okay so I'll just
 
04:17:05.550 --> 04:17:05.560 align:start position:0%
say that based on what I uh uh think I
 
04:17:08.229 --> 04:17:08.239 align:start position:0%
know uh your point of view is
 
04:17:10.269 --> 04:17:10.279 align:start position:0%
particularly credible to
 
04:17:14.269 --> 04:17:14.279 align:start position:0%
me so uh representative
 
04:17:17.670 --> 04:17:17.680 align:start position:0%
wner could we move the question yeah we
 
04:17:21.990 --> 04:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
can okay uh Representative no vanle just
 
04:17:26.590 --> 04:17:26.600 align:start position:0%
a ju just a quick comment to uh Echo uh
 
04:17:28.550 --> 04:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
I think what chairman Edwards said
 
04:17:30.910 --> 04:17:30.920 align:start position:0%
relevant to uh representative
 
04:17:33.389 --> 04:17:33.399 align:start position:0%
stringham's comments you know uh rep
 
04:17:34.910 --> 04:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham and I'm sure if
 
04:17:37.189 --> 04:17:37.199 align:start position:0%
you thought through it um the
 
04:17:40.229 --> 04:17:40.239 align:start position:0%
alternative that you're representing is
 
04:17:41.910 --> 04:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
is throwing the baby out with the bath
 
04:17:45.229 --> 04:17:45.239 align:start position:0%
water and I would suggest that we had a
 
04:17:47.429 --> 04:17:47.439 align:start position:0%
flood we had an emergency situation in
 
04:17:50.429 --> 04:17:50.439 align:start position:0%
elstead in 2005 was pretty pretty
 
04:17:53.750 --> 04:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
serious ripped out killed four people
 
04:17:56.429 --> 04:17:56.439 align:start position:0%
and I can tell you that one of the first
 
04:17:58.950 --> 04:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
things that they're definitely police
 
04:18:02.269 --> 04:18:02.279 align:start position:0%
presence National Guard uh on scene and
 
04:18:04.389 --> 04:18:04.399 align:start position:0%
they were Sheltering uh people who had
 
04:18:07.109 --> 04:18:07.119 align:start position:0%
lost homes and one of the first
 
04:18:09.469 --> 04:18:09.479 align:start position:0%
activities they do is try to determine
 
04:18:12.309 --> 04:18:12.319 align:start position:0%
who uh who is affected so they they're
 
04:18:14.630 --> 04:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
getting information on who was who was
 
04:18:17.269 --> 04:18:17.279 align:start position:0%
in the shelters and they were doing that
 
04:18:21.510 --> 04:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
almost immediately so I would con confer
 
04:18:23.750 --> 04:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
con you know concur with the observation
 
04:18:26.189 --> 04:18:26.199 align:start position:0%
that 72 hours is plenty of time they've
 
04:18:28.229 --> 04:18:28.239 align:start position:0%
got to you know in in that case they to
 
04:18:30.469 --> 04:18:30.479 align:start position:0%
decide who was missing in some of the
 
04:18:32.670 --> 04:18:32.680 align:start position:0%
houses that had gotten destroyed you
 
04:18:35.389 --> 04:18:35.399 align:start position:0%
know so that exercise is kind of a
 
04:18:38.710 --> 04:18:38.720 align:start position:0%
routine matter determine who who is
 
04:18:40.590 --> 04:18:40.600 align:start position:0%
affected who's impacted and you know
 
04:18:43.590 --> 04:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
take names and addresses so that's my
 
04:18:45.790 --> 04:18:45.800 align:start position:0%
two cents so so I don't know all the
 
04:18:47.950 --> 04:18:47.960 align:start position:0%
rules of the house but I I I heard
 
04:18:49.910 --> 04:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
representative walner suggest we just go
 
04:18:53.389 --> 04:18:53.399 align:start position:0%

04:18:56.590 --> 04:18:56.600 align:start position:0%

no representative
 
04:19:36.469 --> 04:19:36.479 align:start position:0%

OTP all right um thank you uh we should
 
04:19:57.349 --> 04:19:57.359 align:start position:0%
U know now uh who would be drafting uh
 
04:20:00.349 --> 04:20:00.359 align:start position:0%
various uh majority and a Minority
 
04:20:02.830 --> 04:20:02.840 align:start position:0%
Report will there be a Minority Report
 
04:20:04.429 --> 04:20:04.439 align:start position:0%
when it comes can I ask a question sorry
 
04:20:05.910 --> 04:20:05.920 align:start position:0%
I don't mean to interrupt you I don't
 
04:20:08.389 --> 04:20:08.399 align:start position:0%
recall doing that last by any or the
 
04:20:10.710 --> 04:20:10.720 align:start position:0%
first year that and I I guess I'm a
 
04:20:13.870 --> 04:20:13.880 align:start position:0%
little taken aback that we're just
 
04:20:15.750 --> 04:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
hate to say our that our discussion
 
04:20:19.309 --> 04:20:19.319 align:start position:0%
won't matter in our full Finance
 
04:20:22.429 --> 04:20:22.439 align:start position:0%
debate okay I I don't want to presuppose
 
04:20:24.590 --> 04:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
that but I would like to get the altern
 
04:20:26.990 --> 04:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
there will be a Minority Report I I know
 
04:20:29.349 --> 04:20:29.359 align:start position:0%
but but one of the thing the reason I'm
 
04:20:32.149 --> 04:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
asking about it now is because I want to
 
04:20:34.429 --> 04:20:34.439 align:start position:0%
make sure that when it comes out of
 
04:20:36.990 --> 04:20:37.000 align:start position:0%
Finance we're immediately ready to put
 
04:20:38.590 --> 04:20:38.600 align:start position:0%
the package together to send to the
 
04:20:40.910 --> 04:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
clerk's office this has been one of the
 
04:20:43.790 --> 04:20:43.800 align:start position:0%
issues that the speaker and the clerk
 
04:20:47.510 --> 04:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
and an I forget Ann's last name Gerald
 
04:20:49.590 --> 04:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
yeah has been asking us to make sure
 
04:20:52.630 --> 04:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
that we get these packages in as quickly
 
04:20:54.309 --> 04:20:54.319 align:start position:0%
as possible so if I say to you that
 
04:20:56.109 --> 04:20:56.119 align:start position:0%
there will be a Minority Report before
 
04:20:58.109 --> 04:20:58.119 align:start position:0%
the end of the day when we exec this is
 
04:21:00.149 --> 04:21:00.159 align:start position:0%
that sufficient yes ma'am great there
 
04:21:01.830 --> 04:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
will be a Minority Report when we
 
04:21:04.309 --> 04:21:04.319 align:start position:0%
execute all right no that's good I my
 
04:21:06.910 --> 04:21:06.920 align:start position:0%
intent is to give you an army terms a
 
04:21:09.149 --> 04:21:09.159 align:start position:0%
warning order so you can begin thinking
 
04:21:11.070 --> 04:21:11.080 align:start position:0%
about it and have it ready when it's
 
04:21:13.429 --> 04:21:13.439 align:start position:0%
time is there anyone that wants to write
 
04:21:16.550 --> 04:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
a majority report or excuse me I'm
 
04:21:19.710 --> 04:21:19.720 align:start position:0%
presuming the vote the the the
 
04:21:24.030 --> 04:21:24.040 align:start position:0%
the a a report that would support the
 
04:21:27.990 --> 04:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
decision of division three I can do all
 
04:21:32.710 --> 04:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
right okay um so has
 
04:21:34.710 --> 04:21:34.720 align:start position:0%
everyone I think we're I think we're
 
04:21:37.950 --> 04:21:37.960 align:start position:0%
done with hp71 i i as I said I do think
 
04:21:40.229 --> 04:21:40.239 align:start position:0%
we're going to try to get the non gerain
 
04:21:43.750 --> 04:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
amendment to it um I in formally i' I've
 
04:21:45.309 --> 04:21:45.319 align:start position:0%
heard that there's really not any
 
04:21:47.429 --> 04:21:47.439 align:start position:0%
opposition to the non- gerain amendment
 
04:21:48.910 --> 04:21:48.920 align:start position:0%
Maybe I'm Wrong maybe there'll be a
 
04:21:51.710 --> 04:21:51.720 align:start position:0%
change of heart but uh but we'll do that
 
04:21:53.790 --> 04:21:53.800 align:start position:0%
in the full finance committee next time
 
04:21:56.189 --> 04:21:56.199 align:start position:0%
we can get it
 
04:22:01.269 --> 04:22:01.279 align:start position:0%
scheduled in on the wall inside um right
 
04:22:05.550 --> 04:22:05.560 align:start position:0%
to the left U of Janet and by the uh
 
04:22:10.590 --> 04:22:10.600 align:start position:0%
copier there's a very long list of 2025
 
04:22:14.229 --> 04:22:14.239 align:start position:0%
house bills and it's dated the 3rd of
 
04:22:16.950 --> 04:22:16.960 align:start position:0%

04:22:24.149 --> 04:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
finance um it shows that the projected
 
04:22:27.510 --> 04:22:27.520 align:start position:0%

04:24:14.269 --> 04:24:14.279 align:start position:0%
just want to remind the members that we
 
04:24:17.189 --> 04:24:17.199 align:start position:0%
meet again as division 3 Monday March
 
04:24:22.790 --> 04:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
10th Tuesday March 11 Wednesday March 12
 
04:24:26.590 --> 04:24:26.600 align:start position:0%
all starting at 10:00 a.m. thank
 
04:24:29.389 --> 04:24:29.399 align:start position:0%
you do you have finished times for that
 
04:24:32.429 --> 04:24:32.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:35.670 --> 04:24:35.680 align:start position:0%
those March 12th our full Finance
 
04:24:37.830 --> 04:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
hearing starts at 2 and since this is
 
04:24:39.550 --> 04:24:39.560 align:start position:0%
the only hearing that's scheduled for
 
04:24:41.710 --> 04:24:41.720 align:start position:0%
the public and it is in rep's Hall we
 
04:24:43.109 --> 04:24:43.119 align:start position:0%
should presume there will be a lot of
 
04:24:46.189 --> 04:24:46.199 align:start position:0%
interest so pack a snack that's my take
 
04:24:46.199 --> 04:24:48.109 align:start position:0%
interest so pack a snack that's my take
on

04:24:48.109 --> 04:24:48.119 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:24:51.510 --> 04:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
it what do represent wner what's our
 
04:24:53.469 --> 04:24:53.479 align:start position:0%
requirement for the committee members to
 
04:24:56.429 --> 04:24:56.439 align:start position:0%
be at the public hearing what I I I know
 
04:24:58.630 --> 04:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
it's good courtesy I know we should be
 
04:25:01.990 --> 04:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
there but but what what what what sort
 
04:25:06.070 --> 04:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
of U house rules or or or uh tradition
 
04:25:08.870 --> 04:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
or protocols uh have we had in the past
 
04:25:11.429 --> 04:25:11.439 align:start position:0%
on that I don't believe there's any
 
04:25:14.189 --> 04:25:14.199 align:start position:0%
house rules I would hope that everyone
 
04:25:16.149 --> 04:25:16.159 align:start position:0%
would want to be there and hear what the
 
04:25:18.269 --> 04:25:18.279 align:start position:0%
public have to say right I mean and
 
04:25:21.550 --> 04:25:21.560 align:start position:0%
we've had excellent attendance in the
 
04:25:23.630 --> 04:25:23.640 align:start position:0%
past from the well I hope we continue I
 
04:25:25.429 --> 04:25:25.439 align:start position:0%
was just curious if there was some sort
 
04:25:28.269 --> 04:25:28.279 align:start position:0%
of historical protocol even when we
 
04:25:30.510 --> 04:25:30.520 align:start position:0%
traveled we went to many we went to
 
04:25:32.910 --> 04:25:32.920 align:start position:0%
other communities in the state and had
 
04:25:34.910 --> 04:25:34.920 align:start position:0%
public hearings and often we'd have
 
04:25:37.149 --> 04:25:37.159 align:start position:0%
almost the full finance committee
 
04:25:40.109 --> 04:25:40.119 align:start position:0%
traveling to those places so I would
 
04:25:41.670 --> 04:25:41.680 align:start position:0%
think if it's right across the street we
 
04:25:43.109 --> 04:25:43.119 align:start position:0%
can all get
 
04:25:45.630 --> 04:25:45.640 align:start position:0%
there okay getting there and staying
 
04:25:47.389 --> 04:25:47.399 align:start position:0%
there may be different for some people's
 
04:25:49.590 --> 04:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
personal lives I don't know but but for
 
04:25:51.590 --> 04:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
the expectation of the members is when
 
04:25:54.269 --> 04:25:54.279 align:start position:0%
it starts it to we we stay other than
 
04:25:54.279 --> 04:25:56.710 align:start position:0%
it starts it to we we stay other than
bathroom

04:25:56.710 --> 04:25:56.720 align:start position:0%
bathroom
 
04:26:00.550 --> 04:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
breaks um go ahead representative tersi
 
04:26:02.109 --> 04:26:02.119 align:start position:0%
I was simply going to say it's too bad
 
04:26:05.429 --> 04:26:05.439 align:start position:0%
that um it's starting so late in the day
 
04:26:07.269 --> 04:26:07.279 align:start position:0%
I it would have been good to allow more
 
04:26:09.910 --> 04:26:09.920 align:start position:0%
availability for the public to show up
 
04:26:12.309 --> 04:26:12.319 align:start position:0%
um with a onewe notice it's just
 
04:26:13.910 --> 04:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
unfortunate that there maybe couldn't be
 
04:26:16.550 --> 04:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
two sessions one offsite start in the
 
04:26:21.070 --> 04:26:21.080 align:start position:0%
morning but it is what it is um sure and
 
04:26:23.070 --> 04:26:23.080 align:start position:0%
because he's my boss I'm just going to
 
04:26:26.229 --> 04:26:26.239 align:start position:0%
also say that U having some availability
 
04:26:28.550 --> 04:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
after 5:00 pm when people get off work
 
04:26:30.990 --> 04:26:31.000 align:start position:0%
actually recognizes that the public
 
04:26:32.710 --> 04:26:32.720 align:start position:0%
behaves differently than we do and it
 
04:26:34.510 --> 04:26:34.520 align:start position:0%
may meet their
 
04:26:36.710 --> 04:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
needs would have been nice also to have
 
04:26:40.429 --> 04:26:40.439 align:start position:0%
a an evening one but it will be
 
04:26:43.189 --> 04:26:43.199 align:start position:0%
evening well I mean
 
04:26:46.429 --> 04:26:46.439 align:start position:0%
I mean one that could start presumably
 
04:26:48.870 --> 04:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
for those iar if I Wasing I'm just going
 
04:26:50.670 --> 04:26:50.680 align:start position:0%
to keep defending my chairman that's
 
04:26:52.550 --> 04:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
fine if I was working and saw a 2 p.m.
 
04:26:54.790 --> 04:26:54.800 align:start position:0%
start my my gut reaction would be by the
 
04:26:57.590 --> 04:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
time I got out of work and got maybe got
 
04:26:59.830 --> 04:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
my children to some kind of child care
 
04:27:02.070 --> 04:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
that uh I it wouldn't be assured that by
 
04:27:03.590 --> 04:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
the time I drove up to conquer from
 
04:27:05.309 --> 04:27:05.319 align:start position:0%
nashaa that it would still be going at
 
04:27:07.670 --> 04:27:07.680 align:start position:0%
6:30 7 o' at night so I think it's still
 
04:27:10.349 --> 04:27:10.359 align:start position:0%
going to be on Zoom so it isn't that the
 
04:27:14.309 --> 04:27:14.319 align:start position:0%
public it isn't loed out then you can't
 
04:27:18.229 --> 04:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
speak I know everyone knows that and I'm
 
04:27:19.910 --> 04:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
just making sure that everyone out there
 
04:27:22.030 --> 04:27:22.040 align:start position:0%
knows that too please show up if you
 
04:27:25.990 --> 04:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
want to ask questions dear public um Mr
 
04:27:26.000 --> 04:27:27.870 align:start position:0%
want to ask questions dear public um Mr
Ripple

04:27:27.870 --> 04:27:27.880 align:start position:0%
Ripple
 
04:27:31.189 --> 04:27:31.199 align:start position:0%
anything all right okay so that's it
 
04:27:41.109 --> 04:27:41.119 align:start position:0%
