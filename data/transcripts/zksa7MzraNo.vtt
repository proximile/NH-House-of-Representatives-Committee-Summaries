licensing okay would you like to say
 
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
anymore would you take questions I'll
 
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:36.840 align:start position:0%
I'll defer to the prime sponsor who uh
 
00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:39.800 align:start position:0%
has a lot of comments on this I will say
 
00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:42.520 align:start position:0%
that the bill itself does a change in
 
00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:45.400 align:start position:0%
the split between the operators take and
 
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
the take of the uh Charities and the
 
00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
take of New Hampshire the HHR bill that
 
00:06:56.309 --> 00:06:56.319 align:start position:0%
we've have in statute give 75% of the
 
00:06:59.589 --> 00:06:59.599 align:start position:0%
take to the operator and 25% of the take
 
00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
to the uh State of New Hampshire to be
 
00:07:06.309 --> 00:07:06.319 align:start position:0%
split up under current law the new bill
 
00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
highp 728 changes the machines from what
 
00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:13.400 align:start position:0%
I think are basically off trck betting
 
00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:16.240 align:start position:0%

machines as part of that process the
 
00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:24.440 align:start position:0%
bill will give an additional take to the
 
00:07:27.029 --> 00:07:27.039 align:start position:0%
state it reduces the take from the
 
00:07:31.589 --> 00:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
operator from 75% to 70% and increases
 
00:07:35.629 --> 00:07:35.639 align:start position:0%
the take to the state from 25 to
 
00:07:38.029 --> 00:07:38.039 align:start position:0%
30% okay thank
 
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:40.440 align:start position:0%
you I know that you're not you're not
 
00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:43.360 align:start position:0%
the uh sponsor of this so I don't think
 
00:07:46.189 --> 00:07:46.199 align:start position:0%
we'll unless represent El may have a
 
00:07:49.909 --> 00:07:49.919 align:start position:0%
question uh just of you are we not going
 
00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
to be able to talk to representative
 
00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:54.560 align:start position:0%
duet about this bill uh we may not be
 
00:07:58.309 --> 00:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
able to so we will hear from uh other
 
00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
testimony for now
 
00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:03.000 align:start position:0%

means thank you Mr
 
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:17.360 align:start position:0%
chair uh I was minding my own business
 
00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:19.240 align:start position:0%
yesterday at about four o'clock I just
 
00:08:21.469 --> 00:08:21.479 align:start position:0%
went into the calendar and said uh
 
00:08:22.909 --> 00:08:22.919 align:start position:0%
what's going on in Ways and Means
 
00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
because I was just like keeping track
 
00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:27.560 align:start position:0%
then I saw this Bell I said you know I
 
00:08:30.149 --> 00:08:30.159 align:start position:0%
really should should show up given that
 
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
I as well first off pamy former State
 
00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:36.240 align:start position:0%
Rep six terms wayy means for 12 years
 
00:08:38.709 --> 00:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
and also uh was chair of the charitable
 
00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:40.760 align:start position:0%
gaming study commission as you all know
 
00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:43.000 align:start position:0%
because I've been here before on this I
 
00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:47.000 align:start position:0%
put before you a a handout which would
 
00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
be important to follow along with
 
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
especially the first
 
00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:53.160 align:start position:0%
page um and I guess I'll I thought I was
 
00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
going to repeat what Fred was going to
 
00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
say but I guess Fred's I just found out
 
00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:58.160 align:start position:0%
just a minute ago that Fred took a job
 
00:09:02.269 --> 00:09:02.279 align:start position:0%
elsewhere so
 
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
um so as as you know we had a consultant
 
00:09:10.389 --> 00:09:10.399 align:start position:0%
spectrum and in in that report it said
 
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
that you know uh New Hampshire it's
 
00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
costing you 12 to 18% more in expense to
 
00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:19.720 align:start position:0%
have these historic racing
 
00:09:21.949 --> 00:09:21.959 align:start position:0%
machines uh because of the fees
 
00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:25.360 align:start position:0%
associated with the uh the total lator
 
00:09:27.069 --> 00:09:27.079 align:start position:0%
fees which are the the thing that
 
00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:29.800 align:start position:0%
calculates the winnings like any other
 
00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:30.949 align:start position:0%
calculates the winnings like any other
track

00:09:30.949 --> 00:09:30.959 align:start position:0%
track
 
00:09:34.509 --> 00:09:34.519 align:start position:0%
race and the uh and the fees that go to
 
00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
the tracks because this whole concept
 
00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
was was founded by uh folks in Kentucky
 
00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
who know that racing is dying and they
 
00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:45.320 align:start position:0%
were looking for another source of
 
00:09:48.829 --> 00:09:48.839 align:start position:0%
Revenue so all those historic Races they
 
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:52.200 align:start position:0%
charge for those so there's a fee in
 
00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
between this is from the consultant
 
00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
about you know 12 to
 
00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.949 align:start position:0%
about you know 12 to
18%

00:09:57.949 --> 00:09:57.959 align:start position:0%
18%
 
00:10:01.389 --> 00:10:01.399 align:start position:0%
so we wasn't our charge to really be
 
00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
looking at do we convert for as a
 
00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:05.640 align:start position:0%
commission do from historic racing to
 
00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:07.480 align:start position:0%
slot machines I'm calling a slot
 
00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:09.640 align:start position:0%
machines the vernacular okay there's
 
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:12.040 align:start position:0%
other language in here uh I'm just using
 
00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
the vernacular uh slot machines
 
00:10:18.389 --> 00:10:18.399 align:start position:0%
everybody knows so um so I took a look
 
00:10:21.069 --> 00:10:21.079 align:start position:0%
at the Bell last night and my wife said
 
00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
what are you
 
00:10:23.829 --> 00:10:23.839 align:start position:0%
doing we used to have dinner at a
 
00:10:24.829 --> 00:10:24.839 align:start position:0%
certain time he said well give me
 
00:10:24.839 --> 00:10:25.829 align:start position:0%
certain time he said well give me
another

00:10:25.829 --> 00:10:25.839 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:27.800 align:start position:0%
hour um I'm going to put something
 
00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:29.720 align:start position:0%
together here and I I I reviewed the
 
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
bill and I had some questions uh but I
 
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
also wanted to share my understanding of
 
00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
the bill uh and just and I'm glad I'm
 
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
here because uh the prime sponsor isn't
 
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
here and again I didn't know he took
 
00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
another job so in the first page um I
 
00:10:49.949 --> 00:10:49.959 align:start position:0%
think representative OLS touched on
 
00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
it I said who's the beneficiary of the
 
00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:56.720 align:start position:0%
of the uh gross uh Gaming revenue the
 
00:11:00.069 --> 00:11:00.079 align:start position:0%
gross Gaming revenue is the revenue
 
00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
all the payouts okay whether it's table
 
00:11:05.389 --> 00:11:05.399 align:start position:0%
games or or the machine
 
00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:10.079 align:start position:0%
games so yes the facilities were getting
 
00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
75% of the of the revenue but now with
 
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:16.720 align:start position:0%
this new bill they would only get 70% as
 
00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
representative om mentioned and I have a
 
00:11:20.509 --> 00:11:20.519 align:start position:0%
footnote and I'm going to explain that
 
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
in a second Charities go from 8.33% to
 
00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
10.5% or Plus
 
00:11:30.389 --> 00:11:30.399 align:start position:0%
2.17 lottery
 
00:11:31.949 --> 00:11:31.959 align:start position:0%
uh which is really goes to the education
 
00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:36.200 align:start position:0%
fund eventually goes from 16.67% to 18%
 
00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:38.120 align:start position:0%
or an increase of
 
00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:41.240 align:start position:0%
1.33% problem gaming nothing came from
 
00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
it other than problem gaming was funded
 
00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:45.880 align:start position:0%
by breakage from historic racing bracing
 
00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
breaking is a is a horse racing term for
 
00:11:51.269 --> 00:11:51.279 align:start position:0%
the when they when they settle out any
 
00:11:52.829 --> 00:11:52.839 align:start position:0%
any uh
 
00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:56.440 align:start position:0%
rounding goes to the facility okay but
 
00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
what we did in historic racing has
 
00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:00.360 align:start position:0%
pointed that breakage to problem gaming
 
00:12:02.949 --> 00:12:02.959 align:start position:0%
and I have some comments on that as well
 
00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
and then the new the new wrinkle is that
 
00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:08.360 align:start position:0%
uh uh the sponsor of the bill decided
 
00:12:10.509 --> 00:12:10.519 align:start position:0%
that group a retirement should be a
 
00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:15.720 align:start position:0%
beneficiary of 1.42 five% of the of the
 
00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
gain so let's look at foot number
 
00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
one so the consultant report said that
 
00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
55% of table game
 
00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
Revenue uh that went to facilities was
 
00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:29.720 align:start position:0%
low so they said that was low
 
00:12:32.189 --> 00:12:32.199 align:start position:0%
but then they said 75% of HHR Revenue
 
00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:34.240 align:start position:0%
going to facility was high as compared
 
00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:35.480 align:start position:0%
to slot
 
00:12:38.269 --> 00:12:38.279 align:start position:0%
machines using HHR machines instead of
 
00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:40.680 align:start position:0%
slot machines cost the facility
 
00:12:43.069 --> 00:12:43.079 align:start position:0%
12.18% more because of totalizer and
 
00:12:46.509 --> 00:12:46.519 align:start position:0%
historic racing fees to tra uh to to the
 
00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:50.360 align:start position:0%
tracks also there are only four there
 
00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:52.680 align:start position:0%
are only four manufacturers of historic
 
00:12:55.069 --> 00:12:55.079 align:start position:0%
racing machines and there 12
 
00:12:58.030 --> 00:12:58.040 align:start position:0%
manufacturers of slot machines and what
 
00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:00.680 align:start position:0%
we found out from the the commission was
 
00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:03.800 align:start position:0%
that uh the given that there's not very
 
00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
lack of competition in that that market
 
00:13:09.389 --> 00:13:09.399 align:start position:0%
of HHR machines that the the facilities
 
00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
can get a better deal with slot machines
 
00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
just from a sheer competition
 
00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
standpoint so even though the percentage
 
00:13:20.509 --> 00:13:20.519 align:start position:0%
of gross Gaming revenue is reduced by
 
00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:23.320 align:start position:0%
5% facilities benefit because their
 
00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:26.440 align:start position:0%
operating cost will go down remember
 
00:13:30.189 --> 00:13:30.199 align:start position:0%
doing with those fees helps first the
 
00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
facilities they do not get the they they
 
00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
they're going to they're going to run
 
00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
these machines without having to pay the
 
00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
the cost of the all those fees for the
 
00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
totalizer and for the uh historic racing
 
00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:46.680 align:start position:0%
fees to the tracks and then there's
 
00:13:48.189 --> 00:13:48.199 align:start position:0%
better competition they get better they
 
00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:49.720 align:start position:0%
can get better prices on the slot
 
00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
machines than they can with HHR machines
 
00:13:53.189 --> 00:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
because of the
 
00:13:57.829 --> 00:13:57.839 align:start position:0%
competition so so yes they're they're
 
00:14:01.829 --> 00:14:01.839 align:start position:0%
getting uh 5% less but in the same
 
00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:04.120 align:start position:0%
breath I will say that remember the
 
00:14:08.829 --> 00:14:08.839 align:start position:0%
Consultants report said that um that the
 
00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
uh table game revenues were lower to the
 
00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:15.800 align:start position:0%
facilities than a normal that they see
 
00:14:19.829 --> 00:14:19.839 align:start position:0%
out there so I think in Balance I I'm
 
00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
not going to you know I'm not going to
 
00:14:23.509 --> 00:14:23.519 align:start position:0%
address whether it's a good idea to go
 
00:14:25.189 --> 00:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
to Group B retirement or wherever you
 
00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:28.360 align:start position:0%
want to allocate the money but I think
 
00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
representative own touched on it it's
 
00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:32.440 align:start position:0%
really really two things what goes to
 
00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
facilities and what goes to the state
 
00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
and what the state does with allocating
 
00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:40.160 align:start position:0%
that money is up to you folks okay uh
 
00:14:44.069 --> 00:14:44.079 align:start position:0%
and uh so and if in
 
00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:46.600 align:start position:0%
that what I just said in in the footw
 
00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:49.160 align:start position:0%
one is in the recommendation 12 of the
 
00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:51.800 align:start position:0%
of the of the report uh if you want to I
 
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
don't know if you ever got the report
 
00:14:54.829 --> 00:14:54.839 align:start position:0%
out there everybody but that's what that
 
00:14:59.150 --> 00:14:59.160 align:start position:0%
is so for Charities Charities gain uh 2.
 
00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
17% in this B in this bill the way
 
00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
written uh and again the the commission
 
00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:06.920 align:start position:0%
report recommendation
 
00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
12 said
 
00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
that said that Charities and the state's
 
00:15:16.509 --> 00:15:16.519 align:start position:0%
revenues will increase and they will and
 
00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
let me read let me read let me read uh
 
00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:23.320 align:start position:0%
recommendation 12 again this wasn't on
 
00:15:25.069 --> 00:15:25.079 align:start position:0%
our radar screen but we took it up
 
00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
because of the consultant's report the
 
00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
question that we pose to the commission
 
00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:31.880 align:start position:0%
was should New Hampshire switch from HHR
 
00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:33.800 align:start position:0%
machines to stop
 
00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
machines and here's what here's the
 
00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
here's the dialogue that went on as
 
00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned before the Spectrum report
 
00:15:41.829 --> 00:15:41.839 align:start position:0%
indicates that facilities are paying 12
 
00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
to 18% of
 
00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:47.480 align:start position:0%
ggr uh gross Gaming revenue more for HHR
 
00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
machines because of the totalizer and
 
00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:51.720 align:start position:0%
historic racing fees that do not exist
 
00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:54.040 align:start position:0%
in slot machines in addition there are
 
00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
only four HHR manufacturers and close to
 
00:15:59.069 --> 00:15:59.079 align:start position:0%
a dozen slot machine manufacturers so
 
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
cost of compet competitive competition
 
00:16:04.629 --> 00:16:04.639 align:start position:0%
the least costs of for HH machines are
 
00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
higher than slot machines as discussion
 
00:16:09.309 --> 00:16:09.319 align:start position:0%
evolved in the commission there was a
 
00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:11.240 align:start position:0%
recognition that leg the legislature
 
00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
went with HHR machines when we did in
 
00:16:18.069 --> 00:16:18.079 align:start position:0%
the first place since there wasn't much
 
00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
support for slot machines I'm just being
 
00:16:23.189 --> 00:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
honest here at the time the fact that
 
00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
HHR machines have a about a 5-second
 
00:16:29.389 --> 00:16:29.399 align:start position:0%
delay between plays was enough to win
 
00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
support in the legislature and what I
 
00:16:33.189 --> 00:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
mean there
 
00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
is okay these machines are really
 
00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
designed for people to pull down a
 
00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:41.240 align:start position:0%
screen and to look at the race and to
 
00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
see the record of the horse not the name
 
00:16:46.309 --> 00:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
of the horse the record of the of the uh
 
00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:48.920 align:start position:0%
jockey not the name of the Jockey and to
 
00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
make a reason decision about which which
 
00:16:54.309 --> 00:16:54.319 align:start position:0%
horse you're going to say he going to
 
00:16:56.949 --> 00:16:56.959 align:start position:0%
win place you know
 
00:16:59.350 --> 00:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
whatever I've observed
 
00:17:02.189 --> 00:17:02.199 align:start position:0%
over my years since that went in uh
 
00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:03.800 align:start position:0%
through my commission work going to
 
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
various facilities nobody plays it that
 
00:17:09.029 --> 00:17:09.039 align:start position:0%
way Everybody Plays the auto playay like
 
00:17:10.789 --> 00:17:10.799 align:start position:0%
they're playing a slot
 
00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
machine and and that's just the way it
 
00:17:15.309 --> 00:17:15.319 align:start position:0%
is and I've talked to owners of these
 
00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:17.000 align:start position:0%
facilities and they concur that that's
 
00:17:20.590 --> 00:17:20.600 align:start position:0%
basically the way people play so moving
 
00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:24.520 align:start position:0%
from uh from a from a from a from the
 
00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
poent from the standpoint of the user
 
00:17:27.949 --> 00:17:27.959 align:start position:0%
they think they're playing slot machines
 
00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
anyway okay
 
00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
so uh but that 5sec delay is because of
 
00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:35.640 align:start position:0%
the the calculation that has to be made
 
00:17:38.909 --> 00:17:38.919 align:start position:0%
at the after the BET after the after the
 
00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
button is pushed and the winner is the
 
00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
winners are chosen then it has a slight
 
00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
delay to do that totalizer work that
 
00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
needs to be done to calculate the
 
00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:51.070 align:start position:0%
needs to be done to calculate the
payouts

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:51.080 align:start position:0%
payouts
 
00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:53.720 align:start position:0%
okay uh but 5 seconds but this is what
 
00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
the commission said the deliberative we
 
00:17:58.029 --> 00:17:58.039 align:start position:0%
called it I call it the speed and they
 
00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
they Chang it to Del velocity the
 
00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:02.360 align:start position:0%
deliberative velocity of play of these
 
00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:04.720 align:start position:0%
machines was still attractive to many on
 
00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:05.390 align:start position:0%
machines was still attractive to many on
the

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:05.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
commission meaning they wanted to stay
 
00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
with HHR also discussed was whether it
 
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
was too soon to consider changing to the
 
00:18:17.149 --> 00:18:17.159 align:start position:0%
facil uh to the uh slot machines but
 
00:18:19.549 --> 00:18:19.559 align:start position:0%
there was a consensus that moving to
 
00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:22.280 align:start position:0%
slot machines would increase revenues to
 
00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
the facilities the Charities and the
 
00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
state and as you can see this bill that
 
00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:29.720 align:start position:0%
does happen okay
 
00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:31.710 align:start position:0%
does happen okay
so

00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:31.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
um so that's that one and then for uh
 
00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
the lottery and it which basically the
 
00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
net most of the lottery net goes to all
 
00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
of the lottery net goes to the education
 
00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:48.440 align:start position:0%
fund so that went up 1.3% and basically
 
00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:50.200 align:start position:0%
I I would point you to the commission
 
00:18:52.669 --> 00:18:52.679 align:start position:0%
report again uh
 
00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:55.400 align:start position:0%
12 I talked about
 
00:18:58.230 --> 00:18:58.240 align:start position:0%
breakage um and let me read my my
 
00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.430 align:start position:0%
breakage um and let me read my my
footnote

00:18:59.430 --> 00:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
footnote
 
00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
for with HHR machines bra breaka was the
 
00:19:05.149 --> 00:19:05.159 align:start position:0%
source of revenue for problem
 
00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:08.240 align:start position:0%
gaming the commission study discovered
 
00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:10.520 align:start position:0%
that only one vendor had the capacity to
 
00:19:12.909 --> 00:19:12.919 align:start position:0%
calculate the breakage big problem four
 
00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
vendors only one was calculating it only
 
00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
one V only one vendor was contributing
 
00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:19.360 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
fund this issue was placed on the ACT we
 
00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
didn't have enough time to resolve that
 
00:19:26.149 --> 00:19:26.159 align:start position:0%
so this issue was placed on the action
 
00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:28.240 align:start position:0%
list for the follow-up commission to
 
00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
address which you all voted for there's
 
00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
a follow-up commission and we had a long
 
00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:33.240 align:start position:0%
list of things that we recommended
 
00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:36.760 align:start position:0%
needed to to continue on if this bill
 
00:19:39.549 --> 00:19:39.559 align:start position:0%
passes there will be a more steady flow
 
00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:41.480 align:start position:0%
of problem Garing funds doing it this
 
00:19:43.549 --> 00:19:43.559 align:start position:0%
way and it'll be and I don't I don't
 
00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:45.640 align:start position:0%
have the raw numbers I don't there was
 
00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
no fiscal note but it'll be substantial
 
00:19:49.789 --> 00:19:49.799 align:start position:0%
even though it sounds like a small
 
00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
percentage it'll be it'll be a
 
00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
substantial amount that it will go to
 
00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:55.000 align:start position:0%
the problem gaming fund and we had a
 
00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
whole secondary study done on like I
 
00:19:58.990 --> 00:19:59.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned last time on problem gaming
 
00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of work that needs to
 
00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:03.400 align:start position:0%
be done on problem gaming not just from
 
00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:05.240 align:start position:0%
the terrible gaming but from all of the
 
00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:08.320 align:start position:0%
betting that goes on in the state um and
 
00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:09.880 align:start position:0%
that that was also in our report that
 
00:20:11.669 --> 00:20:11.679 align:start position:0%
this follow-up commission should really
 
00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
be addressing a a better structure for
 
00:20:16.029 --> 00:20:16.039 align:start position:0%
for problem
 
00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:20.840 align:start position:0%
gaming so um but this problem of
 
00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:23.480 align:start position:0%
breakage if you go to S machines goes
 
00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:27.240 align:start position:0%
away it goes away so I guess that's a
 
00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:29.720 align:start position:0%
benefit if if we go sub machines this
 
00:20:31.909 --> 00:20:31.919 align:start position:0%
breakage issue is is not no longer an
 
00:20:33.549 --> 00:20:33.559 align:start position:0%
issue and then we have also have a
 
00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
better stream of
 
00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:38.200 align:start position:0%
Revenue so on the fifth point about
 
00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.149 align:start position:0%
Revenue so on the fifth point about
Group

00:20:39.149 --> 00:20:39.159 align:start position:0%
Group
 
00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:41.720 align:start position:0%
B uh again I just simply say that it's
 
00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
up to ways of me to decide what a
 
00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
reasonable allocation should be so
 
00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
there's couple of two other points I
 
00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
want to make um one the other issue that
 
00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
needed to be
 
00:20:57.310 --> 00:20:57.320 align:start position:0%
solved was between slot machines and HHR
 
00:21:00.149 --> 00:21:00.159 align:start position:0%
machines which is is recommendation 20
 
00:21:03.549 --> 00:21:03.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
report let me let me read recommendation
 
00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
20 um and this came up this issue came
 
00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
up from our uh Assistant Attorney
 
00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
General who was on the
 
00:21:17.269 --> 00:21:17.279 align:start position:0%
commission okay so the question we posed
 
00:21:19.789 --> 00:21:19.799 align:start position:0%
to our commission members uh this is the
 
00:21:21.269 --> 00:21:21.279 align:start position:0%
way I did it as chair I I POS the
 
00:21:22.549 --> 00:21:22.559 align:start position:0%
question and then we have the discussion
 
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
then we come to a
 
00:21:26.149 --> 00:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
conclusion do we agree with the spectum
 
00:21:29.149 --> 00:21:29.159 align:start position:0%
report that our gaming oh one r one r 20
 
00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:31.480 align:start position:0%
is there an undue economic concentration
 
00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
of HHR machine manufacturers currently
 
00:21:35.789 --> 00:21:35.799 align:start position:0%
functioning in New Hampshire
 
00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:38.240 align:start position:0%
Market the commission discussed whether
 
00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:39.070 align:start position:0%
Market the commission discussed whether
the

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:39.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
legislature should consider economic
 
00:21:43.269 --> 00:21:43.279 align:start position:0%
concentration among the manufacturers of
 
00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:46.360 align:start position:0%
historic racing machines the evidence
 
00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
suggests that only two manufacturers of
 
00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:51.080 align:start position:0%
HHR machines control almost the entire
 
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
Market if you looked at it I mean one is
 
00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
the real dominant there's one that's
 
00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
kind of a moderate and the other two are
 
00:21:59.070 --> 00:21:59.080 align:start position:0%
very very little so it's really really
 
00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
one maybe one and a half of the vendors
 
00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:05.320 align:start position:0%
that of their machines that are in
 
00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:08.190 align:start position:0%
that of their machines that are in
place

00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:08.200 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
um again for the whole state suggesting
 
00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:13.480 align:start position:0%
a afka competition and a neom
 
00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
monopolistic status over a significant
 
00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
portion of gaming within the state the
 
00:22:21.149 --> 00:22:21.159 align:start position:0%
commission recommends legislation to
 
00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
remedy this consistent with article
 
00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:29.000 align:start position:0%
83 of the New Hampshire Constitution and
 
00:22:32.269 --> 00:22:32.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
you the last page of what I handed out
 
00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
has as article 83 and I underlined the
 
00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
the the relevant Pace free and Fair
 
00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:47.000 align:start position:0%
competition in trades and industries is
 
00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:49.320 align:start position:0%
an inherent and essential right of the
 
00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
people and should be protected against
 
00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
all monopolies and um and uh
 
00:22:58.669 --> 00:22:58.679 align:start position:0%
conspiracies which tend to Hinder or
 
00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
destroy it so uh so this was another
 
00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:04.520 align:start position:0%
thing that we were suggesting be taken
 
00:23:08.149 --> 00:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
up by the by the follow-up commission
 
00:23:10.029 --> 00:23:10.039 align:start position:0%
and or by the
 
00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
legislature uh but again if we do away
 
00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:15.200 align:start position:0%
with HHR this goes away as
 
00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.789 align:start position:0%
with HHR this goes away as
well

00:23:16.789 --> 00:23:16.799 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:19.360 align:start position:0%
so and then the last
 
00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:22.480 align:start position:0%
thing is I was wanted to make sure and I
 
00:23:25.029 --> 00:23:25.039 align:start position:0%
didn't have time to I read the Bell
 
00:23:27.029 --> 00:23:27.039 align:start position:0%
twice I didn't really have a time to
 
00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
study it um but my
 
00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
interpretation facilities phasing out of
 
00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
HHR slot machines I'm
 
00:23:41.789 --> 00:23:41.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:46.840 align:start position:0%
um uh page five of the Bell lines 20 to
 
00:23:49.789 --> 00:23:49.799 align:start position:0%
22 if you look at the effective
 
00:23:52.269 --> 00:23:52.279 align:start position:0%
dates it says section one of this act
 
00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:55.320 align:start position:0%
shall take effect upon
 
00:23:58.950 --> 00:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
passage which puts in place all the
 
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
language in section one which is all the
 
00:24:04.909 --> 00:24:04.919 align:start position:0%
slot machine language okay and then the
 
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
remainder of this act shall take effect
 
00:24:09.269 --> 00:24:09.279 align:start position:0%
January 1
 
00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
2028 so I a three years and that does
 
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
away with all of the all of the HHR
 
00:24:19.549 --> 00:24:19.559 align:start position:0%
language okay that goes away so my
 
00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
interpretation is it seems like slot
 
00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
machines can start being phased out upon
 
00:24:29.149 --> 00:24:29.159 align:start position:0%
passage of section one
 
00:24:31.549 --> 00:24:31.559 align:start position:0%
it seems like HHR machines need to be
 
00:24:33.669 --> 00:24:33.679 align:start position:0%
phased out by January 1st
 
00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
2028 when all other sections of the
 
00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:40.240 align:start position:0%
spill are eliminated in from section six
 
00:24:43.669 --> 00:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
and then I concluded well it seems like
 
00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:46.440 align:start position:0%
in the inter room between when and it's
 
00:24:48.909 --> 00:24:48.919 align:start position:0%
on the effective date okay uh it's the
 
00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:52.360 align:start position:0%
uh phas out upon passage between upon
 
00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
passage to January 1st of
 
00:24:57.909 --> 00:24:57.919 align:start position:0%
2028 I think what I think what the bill
 
00:25:00.029 --> 00:25:00.039 align:start position:0%
is saying is that we can during the
 
00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
inter room that these machines can be
 
00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
phased out and phased
 
00:25:07.149 --> 00:25:07.159 align:start position:0%
in okay there's a three-year people up
 
00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:08.600 align:start position:0%
to the facility what they want to do
 
00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
they want to start phasing out their
 
00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
their uh historic racing machines they
 
00:25:14.269 --> 00:25:14.279 align:start position:0%
can at a certain pace and start putting
 
00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
them putting in HHR uh slot machines
 
00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:20.240 align:start position:0%
they can it's up to them uh they can
 
00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
choose in the in this period it can't be
 
00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:24.360 align:start position:0%
instantaneous but let's say they want to
 
00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
get rid of all their HHR machines they
 
00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
can do this probably in a couple of
 
00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:30.640 align:start position:0%
months or for probably half a year and
 
00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
have all slot machines up to them that
 
00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
is my
 
00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:36.760 align:start position:0%
interpretation I was going to ask the
 
00:25:38.669 --> 00:25:38.679 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor if that was his
 
00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:41.000 align:start position:0%
interpretation but anybody here can help
 
00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
me I I I just put that out as a question
 
00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:45.640 align:start position:0%
that needs to be verified okay so that's
 
00:25:48.149 --> 00:25:48.159 align:start position:0%
what I have thank you sir thank you um
 
00:25:51.149 --> 00:25:51.159 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
00:25:55.549 --> 00:25:55.559 align:start position:0%
elme thank you on I'm trying to just ask
 
00:25:58.470 --> 00:25:58.480 align:start position:0%
questions that you might know more about
 
00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh from the commission than whatever
 
00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
he's doing uh but the first one is are
 
00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:11.200 align:start position:0%
there HRM contracts that would have to
 
00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:13.590 align:start position:0%
there HRM contracts that would have to
be

00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:15.549 --> 00:26:15.559 align:start position:0%
broken uh are
 
00:26:19.269 --> 00:26:19.279 align:start position:0%
there HHR sorry you call it something
 
00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:21.200 align:start position:0%
else these days the horse racing
 
00:26:24.549 --> 00:26:24.559 align:start position:0%
machines yeah the HHR machines yeah uh
 
00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
well again there's a three year that's
 
00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
why is this a three years 25 26 27 yes
 
00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
three years uh this three years I'm not
 
00:26:34.389 --> 00:26:34.399 align:start position:0%
sure what the length of these Agreements
 
00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:37.240 align:start position:0%
are most of these most of the facilities
 
00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:41.000 align:start position:0%
will will uh lease them that's good
 
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
question um maybe someone behind me
 
00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
knows the answer to that but um I I I
 
00:26:50.029 --> 00:26:50.039 align:start position:0%
would I would assume because this
 
00:26:51.669 --> 00:26:51.679 align:start position:0%
technology evolves with these all these
 
00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:54.200 align:start position:0%
different kind of machines and I I don't
 
00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:56.360 align:start position:0%
this is my opinion you know you can
 
00:26:59.230 --> 00:26:59.240 align:start position:0%
verify uh that I don't think they get
 
00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:02.240 align:start position:0%
into long longterm leases of these uh
 
00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:04.760 align:start position:0%
because they want to get the latest and
 
00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:08.720 align:start position:0%
greatest machine in to do it so I think
 
00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:10.440 align:start position:0%
they were giving these we're giving them
 
00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
three years to get out of any leases or
 
00:27:15.029 --> 00:27:15.039 align:start position:0%
I think leases would expire and probably
 
00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:16.520 align:start position:0%
what would happen is when the lease
 
00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
expires they're going to go to slot
 
00:27:25.789 --> 00:27:25.799 align:start position:0%
machines yeah if I could another one
 
00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
on who provides the
 
00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:32.600 align:start position:0%
programming uh for the slot machines
 
00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:36.520 align:start position:0%
when we were doing this for a long time
 
00:27:41.149 --> 00:27:41.159 align:start position:0%
decade two ago on there was
 
00:27:41.159 --> 00:27:43.070 align:start position:0%
decade two ago on there was
substantial

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
substantial
 
00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
00:27:50.350 --> 00:27:50.360 align:start position:0%
testimony on and books that were written
 
00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
uh that
 
00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
showed that the programming for slot
 
00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:01.320 align:start position:0%
machines is done from one central place
 
00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:02.320 align:start position:0%
in a
 
00:28:04.669 --> 00:28:04.679 align:start position:0%
casino uh and
 
00:28:08.549 --> 00:28:08.559 align:start position:0%
changes as different clientele show up
 
00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:14.440 align:start position:0%
in theot slot machine area on so that uh
 
00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:17.720 align:start position:0%
they will get the maximum uh amount of
 
00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:21.480 align:start position:0%
money out of the people who have come in
 
00:28:24.509 --> 00:28:24.519 align:start position:0%
uh right can okay again I'm not an
 
00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:28.600 align:start position:0%
expert in this but um
 
00:28:29.789 --> 00:28:29.799 align:start position:0%
okay first
 
00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:32.720 align:start position:0%
off in even in the historic racing Bill
 
00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
and in this bill there is um there's a
 
00:28:40.389 --> 00:28:40.399 align:start position:0%
range of of payouts in slot
 
00:28:42.389 --> 00:28:42.399 align:start position:0%
machines uh and in historic racing
 
00:28:46.669 --> 00:28:46.679 align:start position:0%
machines too uh the higher the lower the
 
00:28:49.029 --> 00:28:49.039 align:start position:0%
payouts the less likely people are going
 
00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
to come to use those machines because
 
00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
they they they feel it they feel that
 
00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
this this you know if you go to Vegas
 
00:28:58.669 --> 00:28:58.679 align:start position:0%
there are all sorts of but if you go to
 
00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
the old Vegas you get bigger payouts
 
00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
there probably a lower overhead and they
 
00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
they could they could tolerate that but
 
00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:09.720 align:start position:0%
but if they if they set the if they set
 
00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:12.640 align:start position:0%
the the payouts too
 
00:29:15.269 --> 00:29:15.279 align:start position:0%
low so that they would make more money
 
00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
they're going to lose business and now
 
00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
in New
 
00:29:22.549 --> 00:29:22.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as you know we we have agreed
 
00:29:24.389 --> 00:29:24.399 align:start position:0%
to up to 19
 
00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
facilities uh and there's going to be
 
00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
competition that's going to prevent
 
00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
uh any tampering with that that rate now
 
00:29:34.669 --> 00:29:34.679 align:start position:0%
in terms of the machines themselves it's
 
00:29:37.509 --> 00:29:37.519 align:start position:0%
in the bill I did see it again that U
 
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
all these machines and Charlie McIntyre
 
00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
could testify that's better than I can
 
00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
but all these machines are test they
 
00:29:45.269 --> 00:29:45.279 align:start position:0%
have to be tested there's a there's a
 
00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:48.320 align:start position:0%
lab that tests these things that that we
 
00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I'm saying this
 
00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:52.440 align:start position:0%
correctly but we contract with that make
 
00:29:53.909 --> 00:29:53.919 align:start position:0%
sure that these machines aren't being
 
00:29:57.230 --> 00:29:57.240 align:start position:0%
tampered with um and I I would I would I
 
00:29:58.990 --> 00:29:59.000 align:start position:0%
would allow I I would ask Charlie that
 
00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:05.669 --> 00:30:05.679 align:start position:0%
understanding I did have a third if
 
00:30:08.029 --> 00:30:08.039 align:start position:0%
nobody else's oh I've got several other
 
00:30:12.509 --> 00:30:12.519 align:start position:0%
people with questions yeah but on
 
00:30:15.269 --> 00:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
specifically and this is this is a dead
 
00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
is uh complete utter dead end issue for
 
00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:24.440 align:start position:0%
me uh is the problem gaming
 
00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:27.240 align:start position:0%
money New Hampshire is a smaller State
 
00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:30.440 align:start position:0%
than massachus it uh what seems like a
 
00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
lot of money if it is not enough money
 
00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
to reestablish the problem gaming uh
 
00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:41.960 align:start position:0%
work in this state we are just depending
 
00:30:46.149 --> 00:30:46.159 align:start position:0%
on addicts to run our state and I find
 
00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
this extremely
 
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.590 align:start position:0%
this extremely
offensive

00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
offensive
 
00:30:52.509 --> 00:30:52.519 align:start position:0%
so so my question is do you know
 
00:30:56.269 --> 00:30:56.279 align:start position:0%
anything about uh does did the
 
00:30:58.350 --> 00:30:58.360 align:start position:0%
commission look at how much money you
 
00:31:01.269 --> 00:31:01.279 align:start position:0%
really need in order to have more than
 
00:31:03.909 --> 00:31:03.919 align:start position:0%
the brochure that is mentioned in this
 
00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
no we we didn't okay yes I actually M I
 
00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:08.840 align:start position:0%
agree with you
 
00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
100% when we and that's why as a
 
00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
commission we had a little extra money
 
00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:16.600 align:start position:0%
that was was allocated To Us by
 
00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
legislation we had a second we had a
 
00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
second consultant a chair a prom gaming
 
00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:24.360 align:start position:0%
consultant come in so if you look at our
 
00:31:26.029 --> 00:31:26.039 align:start position:0%
final report there's a there's a couple
 
00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:28.360 align:start position:0%
of appendices one has the the spum
 
00:31:29.789 --> 00:31:29.799 align:start position:0%
report and another there's a second
 
00:31:32.149 --> 00:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
report had to do with problem gaming
 
00:31:35.029 --> 00:31:35.039 align:start position:0%
again this wasn't our mission as a as a
 
00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
I I took this where led us as a
 
00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
commission and I said you know we got a
 
00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
big problem we had people come in that
 
00:31:42.629 --> 00:31:42.639 align:start position:0%
supposedly were doing something on on
 
00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:44.320 align:start position:0%
problem gaming in the state but it was
 
00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:47.080 align:start position:0%
very weak it was weak that's why we
 
00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:48.760 align:start position:0%
engaged this other consultant they gave
 
00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
us a lot of great ideas and again in our
 
00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
final report we said that the
 
00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
legislature should take up some of the
 
00:31:58.990 --> 00:31:59.000 align:start position:0%
issues that are in this
 
00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:01.320 align:start position:0%
report that we that we got from from the
 
00:32:04.029 --> 00:32:04.039 align:start position:0%
consultant about problem gaming and we
 
00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
we also agreed that we need a better
 
00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:12.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
I I don't know without having the
 
00:32:18.389 --> 00:32:18.399 align:start position:0%
numbers the current numbers what
 
00:32:18.399 --> 00:32:20.990 align:start position:0%
numbers the current numbers what
this

00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:32:24.909 --> 00:32:24.919 align:start position:0%
0.0075% is okay it sounds small but it's
 
00:32:26.549 --> 00:32:26.559 align:start position:0%
not going to
 
00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
be I was just talking
 
00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
to uh commissioner oh Charlie M
 
00:32:35.669 --> 00:32:35.679 align:start position:0%
executive director of
 
00:32:39.789 --> 00:32:39.799 align:start position:0%
Lottery about uh the the Nash opening
 
00:32:39.799 --> 00:32:40.470 align:start position:0%
Lottery about uh the the Nash opening
this

00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:40.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:32:44.389 --> 00:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
weekend and it was record setting
 
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
numbers astronomical numbers that would
 
00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:49.320 align:start position:0%
if they kept
 
00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:52.760 align:start position:0%
up just alone they would they would
 
00:32:54.789 --> 00:32:54.799 align:start position:0%
would increase the amount of char if
 
00:32:56.789 --> 00:32:56.799 align:start position:0%
this was in place how much money would
 
00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
go to to problem gaming so uh we
 
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
couldn't conclude what the right number
 
00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
was okay we knew it had to be more and
 
00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:08.600 align:start position:0%
we left it up to the legislature to to
 
00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
come up with that and again it's it's on
 
00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
the thing for the follow-up commission
 
00:33:14.549 --> 00:33:14.559 align:start position:0%
to deal with if the if the legislature
 
00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't have time to do it the
 
00:33:17.269 --> 00:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
commission should take this one up and
 
00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
actually I said one of the first things
 
00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
you should do is is take that up because
 
00:33:21.509 --> 00:33:21.519 align:start position:0%
I wrote the report I said this should be
 
00:33:24.669 --> 00:33:24.679 align:start position:0%
the one yeah so thank you yeah I I was
 
00:33:26.149 --> 00:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
on that commission as well we did
 
00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
discuss this we did recognize it a
 
00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
problem and there is and thus you know
 
00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:33.200 align:start position:0%
the recommendation that the legislature
 
00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
take this up but the new commission will
 
00:33:38.590 --> 00:33:38.600 align:start position:0%
also take this up uh if the if the
 
00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
legislature is not acted um by the time
 
00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
the commission has additional um
 
00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:46.200 align:start position:0%
thoughts on how that should proceed
 
00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
representative shamberg you have a
 
00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:49.720 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:33:52.029 --> 00:33:52.039 align:start position:0%
you for taking my I have two questions
 
00:33:54.990 --> 00:33:55.000 align:start position:0%
so I'll ask for a followup when I come
 
00:33:57.789 --> 00:33:57.799 align:start position:0%
uh concerning recommendation 20 about
 
00:34:00.149 --> 00:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
undo concentration you mentioned the
 
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
Assistant Attorney General did he ever
 
00:34:05.549 --> 00:34:05.559 align:start position:0%
use the words Monopoly and conspiracy
 
00:34:05.559 --> 00:34:07.750 align:start position:0%
use the words Monopoly and conspiracy
regarding

00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:11.200 align:start position:0%
HHR he he is the one who came up with
 
00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:14.280 align:start position:0%
the um Let me give me a second he's the
 
00:34:16.869 --> 00:34:16.879 align:start position:0%
one who came up with the
 
00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh the the point
 
00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:23.720 align:start position:0%
that we should he said make it
 
00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:26.200 align:start position:0%
consistent with
 
00:34:28.270 --> 00:34:28.280 align:start position:0%
um where is it
 
00:34:32.149 --> 00:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
make it consistent with uh article 83 of
 
00:34:32.159 --> 00:34:32.950 align:start position:0%
make it consistent with uh article 83 of
the

00:34:32.950 --> 00:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:34:34.829 --> 00:34:34.839 align:start position:0%
Constitution what the words I read to
 
00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
you were article 83 of the Constitution
 
00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:41.399 align:start position:0%
so I guess yes he he that was from
 
00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:45.560 align:start position:0%
him followup Mr chairman second question
 
00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:47.720 align:start position:0%
by removing
 
00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
HHR wouldn't
 
00:34:54.829 --> 00:34:54.839 align:start position:0%
we uh be removing free and Fair
 
00:34:57.750 --> 00:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
competition from the people to decide
 
00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
which one they would like to do uh HHR
 
00:35:06.910 --> 00:35:06.920 align:start position:0%
or this other one
 
00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:08.750 align:start position:0%
or this other one
slots

00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
slots
 
00:35:11.069 --> 00:35:11.079 align:start position:0%
well all of us representing well you all
 
00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
of you representing the people can make
 
00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:14.430 align:start position:0%
of you representing the people can make
that

00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:14.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:16.720 align:start position:0%
decision I mean that's my best answer
 
00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
well by people do you mean constituents
 
00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:19.960 align:start position:0%
or do you mean the people running I just
 
00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:21.800 align:start position:0%
say it says free and Fair competition of
 
00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
Trades into in is inherent essential
 
00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
right of the people okay so the that's
 
00:35:32.069 --> 00:35:32.079 align:start position:0%
why I'm asking uh is this so but really
 
00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
refers to is our
 
00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:37.480 align:start position:0%
businesses that are we keeping is there
 
00:35:39.829 --> 00:35:39.839 align:start position:0%
competition among a like business in
 
00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:42.520 align:start position:0%
this case HHR manufacturers thank you
 
00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:43.720 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
you uh representative Southworth uh
 
00:35:48.829 --> 00:35:48.839 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and thank you
 
00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question I
 
00:35:54.349 --> 00:35:54.359 align:start position:0%
wanted to just clarify number five of
 
00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
the money uh going to uh Group B
 
00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:58.750 align:start position:0%
the money uh going to uh Group B
retirement

00:35:58.750 --> 00:35:58.760 align:start position:0%
retirement
 
00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
I know there's a gap in the retirement
 
00:36:03.589 --> 00:36:03.599 align:start position:0%
from the 2011 changes and so on that
 
00:36:05.589 --> 00:36:05.599 align:start position:0%
they wanted to correct and various
 
00:36:06.829 --> 00:36:06.839 align:start position:0%
sources have said there's going to be
 
00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
money for that I think 40 million or
 
00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
something I just wanted to clarify is
 
00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
this to fill that Gap that we've been
 
00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
talking about again the first time I saw
 
00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
the spill was about four o'clock last
 
00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:22.200 align:start position:0%
night yeah so um I I was hoping
 
00:36:23.230 --> 00:36:23.240 align:start position:0%
representative the set was going to be
 
00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
here to explain that I'm not quite sure
 
00:36:28.309 --> 00:36:28.319 align:start position:0%
that was that I would assume I I I I
 
00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:30.280 align:start position:0%
would say high probability is that's the
 
00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:32.680 align:start position:0%
that's the reason okay thank you okay
 
00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
representative M yeah thank you I have a
 
00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:38.640 align:start position:0%
question on the uh license fees for HHR
 
00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
this kind of goes back to legislative
 
00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
intent which I hope you could comment on
 
00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
it it struck me that the legislative
 
00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:47.880 align:start position:0%
intent with the HHR was to have the mom
 
00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
and pop class of Charities get some
 
00:36:52.349 --> 00:36:52.359 align:start position:0%
additional money in and have that money
 
00:36:55.109 --> 00:36:55.119 align:start position:0%
go to uh charities in
 
00:36:57.750 --> 00:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
particular uh and what we found is that
 
00:36:59.670 --> 00:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
with a very modest license fee for the
 
00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:00.870 align:start position:0%
with a very modest license fee for the
HHR

00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
HHR
 
00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
license uh it turned out that that
 
00:37:05.950 --> 00:37:05.960 align:start position:0%
license could be in effect sold to a
 
00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
third party operator through the
 
00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the law that said
 
00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
because the legislative intent was not
 
00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:16.440 align:start position:0%
clear in the ATR legislation that under
 
00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:19.000 align:start position:0%
case law uh the business could be
 
00:37:22.109 --> 00:37:22.119 align:start position:0%
acquired along with the ATR license and
 
00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:24.680 align:start position:0%
then had that property uh sold to a
 
00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
major operator and relocated to another
 
00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
part of the city
 
00:37:30.829 --> 00:37:30.839 align:start position:0%
and as a consequence of that the HR
 
00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:33.880 align:start position:0%
license became extremely valuable uh
 
00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:35.230 align:start position:0%
license became extremely valuable uh
from

00:37:35.230 --> 00:37:35.240 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:38.200 align:start position:0%
$50 price that we charg to what I'm
 
00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
estimate might be worth as much as $10
 
00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
million so my question goes back to the
 
00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:45.240 align:start position:0%
legislative intent was the legislative
 
00:37:48.030 --> 00:37:48.040 align:start position:0%
intent on HHR to just have the mom and
 
00:37:51.790 --> 00:37:51.800 align:start position:0%
pop uh operators use these machines
 
00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:54.200 align:start position:0%
to um stay in place and get some
 
00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
additional money or was it or was the
 
00:37:58.109 --> 00:37:58.119 align:start position:0%
legislative intent to allow these opport
 
00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
to sell this license and okay I'm gonna
 
00:38:03.349 --> 00:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
give you my uh I'm gonna give you my
 
00:38:03.359 --> 00:38:04.790 align:start position:0%
give you my uh I'm gonna give you my
honest

00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
honest
 
00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
answer and I obviously you know I was
 
00:38:10.589 --> 00:38:10.599 align:start position:0%
involved with bringing HHR to New
 
00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:12.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh because I was supporting
 
00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
the Charities the goal was to bring more
 
00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
money to the charities in the
 
00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:20.240 align:start position:0%
state and I and be honest with you I did
 
00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
not recognize then what door that opened
 
00:38:28.109 --> 00:38:28.119 align:start position:0%
up and it opened up a significant door
 
00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
we only have I think one locally owned
 
00:38:38.190 --> 00:38:38.200 align:start position:0%
facility left of the 19 licenses we now
 
00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:40.440 align:start position:0%
have opened
 
00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
up all of the major players are coming
 
00:38:45.550 --> 00:38:45.560 align:start position:0%
in the door and they own these
 
00:38:48.829 --> 00:38:48.839 align:start position:0%
facilities and uh I think and that's the
 
00:38:49.950 --> 00:38:49.960 align:start position:0%
reason for the
 
00:38:52.990 --> 00:38:53.000 align:start position:0%
commission because we we saw what was
 
00:38:55.990 --> 00:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
was happening and we said wow but the
 
00:38:59.349 --> 00:38:59.359 align:start position:0%
problem is that everybody's playing by
 
00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:03.200 align:start position:0%
the rules that were in law and we didn't
 
00:39:06.030 --> 00:39:06.040 align:start position:0%
change the rules the rules are the rules
 
00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:11.560 align:start position:0%
low fees low whatever and and it's it's
 
00:39:15.309 --> 00:39:15.319 align:start position:0%
happened okay we have what we have now
 
00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
uh we have large facilities and we have
 
00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:20.720 align:start position:0%
uh we have even the brook which is one
 
00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:24.640 align:start position:0%
of the more profitable uh more
 
00:39:28.109 --> 00:39:28.119 align:start position:0%
uh um places that people like to go
 
00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:31.160 align:start position:0%
uh is doing well is going to expand Nash
 
00:39:32.829 --> 00:39:32.839 align:start position:0%
opened up we're going to have the salon
 
00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
place that's going to open it's going to
 
00:39:37.069 --> 00:39:37.079 align:start position:0%
be very big so what the commission
 
00:39:39.309 --> 00:39:39.319 align:start position:0%
talked about was that what's going to
 
00:39:42.069 --> 00:39:42.079 align:start position:0%
happen is that the marketplace is
 
00:39:44.589 --> 00:39:44.599 align:start position:0%
probably going to cleanse itself
 
00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:46.720 align:start position:0%
eventually I mean a little bit happened
 
00:39:50.069 --> 00:39:50.079 align:start position:0%
in in in uh in ashaa I mean there were
 
00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
three facilities now we're down to two
 
00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
one the two became
 
00:39:57.950 --> 00:39:57.960 align:start position:0%
one uh
 
00:39:59.950 --> 00:39:59.960 align:start position:0%
I don't know how long the other is going
 
00:40:02.829 --> 00:40:02.839 align:start position:0%
to last there because these are these
 
00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:07.160 align:start position:0%
have I agree I mean these for whatever
 
00:40:09.710 --> 00:40:09.720 align:start position:0%
whatever reason these have become and
 
00:40:14.309 --> 00:40:14.319 align:start position:0%
becoming real casinos with amenities
 
00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:16.640 align:start position:0%
that people want and that's what Drew so
 
00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:20.200 align:start position:0%
many people over the weekend to and you
 
00:40:21.630 --> 00:40:21.640 align:start position:0%
you know to
 
00:40:23.829 --> 00:40:23.839 align:start position:0%
Nashua because of the amenities the
 
00:40:26.109 --> 00:40:26.119 align:start position:0%
restaurants the the entertainment all
 
00:40:28.349 --> 00:40:28.359 align:start position:0%
that it's a it's a night out out people
 
00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
view it as a night
 
00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:33.640 align:start position:0%
out um and it it is just
 
00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
evolved and that's why it was important
 
00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:39.640 align:start position:0%
that you continue this commission to
 
00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
address the issues and you've heard me
 
00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
say this here that we need to modify the
 
00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:47.800 align:start position:0%
model of how the Charities because if
 
00:40:50.109 --> 00:40:50.119 align:start position:0%
you look at the example of the
 
00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:53.400 align:start position:0%
Nash I mean it was I mean there were
 
00:40:54.589 --> 00:40:54.599 align:start position:0%
Charities making
 
00:40:57.990 --> 00:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
150,000 at the bigger places the Nash is
 
00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
like gigantic and if we don't change the
 
00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:04.280 align:start position:0%
10 days to something less or you know
 
00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
each charity gets 10 days we have to
 
00:41:09.349 --> 00:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
change that model and again that that's
 
00:41:10.910 --> 00:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
it's also on the top of the list of
 
00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:15.240 align:start position:0%
issues that need I tried to change it I
 
00:41:17.829 --> 00:41:17.839 align:start position:0%
I gave suggestions of how to change
 
00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:22.520 align:start position:0%
it uh and it needs to be dealt with and
 
00:41:24.069 --> 00:41:24.079 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping that that's also one of
 
00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:25.800 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of priorities here that
 
00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
this commission should take up and
 
00:41:30.349 --> 00:41:30.359 align:start position:0%
that's one of them because I I I would I
 
00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:31.800 align:start position:0%
anticipated I showed my math to
 
00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:33.240 align:start position:0%
everybody I said you
 
00:41:35.950 --> 00:41:35.960 align:start position:0%
know a charity there could they can gain
 
00:41:39.550 --> 00:41:39.560 align:start position:0%
up to $400,000 for 10 days that's not
 
00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:42.040 align:start position:0%
right we want to we should sprend that
 
00:41:46.309 --> 00:41:46.319 align:start position:0%
wealth to more Charities and U so I
 
00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
guess the bottom line here is that the
 
00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:50.200 align:start position:0%
good news is that we're growing we can
 
00:41:52.309 --> 00:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
help Charities but but the legislature
 
00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
has to act to change that allocation
 
00:41:58.030 --> 00:41:58.040 align:start position:0%
model because we're not letting more
 
00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:00.760 align:start position:0%
Char matter of fact we went we went from
 
00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
three facilities in Nasha I told this
 
00:42:05.790 --> 00:42:05.800 align:start position:0%
example last time one didn't have
 
00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
HHR so there were three Charities that
 
00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:10.150 align:start position:0%
HHR so there were three Charities that
were

00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
helped now we have two
 
00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:14.800 align:start position:0%
facilities and if they had to 10 days
 
00:42:18.829 --> 00:42:18.839 align:start position:0%
each we only help in onethird less
 
00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:21.240 align:start position:0%
because it's that Nash even though it's
 
00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
gigantic it still has two two Charities
 
00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
sponsored that night so we we need as a
 
00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:28.280 align:start position:0%
legislature to jump on this and the and
 
00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
hopefully the Senate will I don't know
 
00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
where that bill is about forming the
 
00:42:33.549 --> 00:42:33.559 align:start position:0%
commission I would I would strongly
 
00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
matter of fact I'm trying to see Kelly
 
00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
aot about this to strongly actually
 
00:42:40.990 --> 00:42:41.000 align:start position:0%
believe it or not
 
00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
um L delandro and I Senator delandro uh
 
00:42:46.950 --> 00:42:46.960 align:start position:0%
different party than me um whatever
 
00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
reason we got along and he and I been
 
00:42:51.470 --> 00:42:51.480 align:start position:0%
talking he calls me periodically we talk
 
00:42:54.309 --> 00:42:54.319 align:start position:0%
about what's going on on this and then I
 
00:42:56.710 --> 00:42:56.720 align:start position:0%
said I'm trying to see Kelly about this
 
00:42:59.589 --> 00:42:59.599 align:start position:0%
and he he he said can I come I go yeah
 
00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely because he knows he knows as
 
00:43:07.230 --> 00:43:07.240 align:start position:0%
well what we need to change um in this
 
00:43:10.309 --> 00:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
in this model yeah that's all thank you
 
00:43:12.430 --> 00:43:12.440 align:start position:0%
uh followup yeah just one follow first
 
00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your very
 
00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:16.200 align:start position:0%
detailed explanation of the history the
 
00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:18.400 align:start position:0%
only follow-up I have is regarding the
 
00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:20.720 align:start position:0%
current license
 
00:43:23.790 --> 00:43:23.800 align:start position:0%
fee on the ground do you feel that that
 
00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
license fee is appropriate or should it
 
00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:27.640 align:start position:0%
be changed to something more substantial
 
00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:29.589 align:start position:0%
be changed to something more substantial
okay

00:43:29.589 --> 00:43:29.599 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
you again Lottery could correct me if
 
00:43:34.829 --> 00:43:34.839 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong but my understanding is that
 
00:43:38.190 --> 00:43:38.200 align:start position:0%
there's 700 I think it's $700 a year to
 
00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:41.400 align:start position:0%
have a game operator's license to have
 
00:43:45.150 --> 00:43:45.160 align:start position:0%
the facility $700 a year whether it's
 
00:43:47.349 --> 00:43:47.359 align:start position:0%
initial or renewal we talked about this
 
00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
at length I was suggesting we increase
 
00:43:52.069 --> 00:43:52.079 align:start position:0%
that through the commission but I
 
00:43:53.910 --> 00:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
couldn't get the vote to do
 
00:43:57.630 --> 00:43:57.640 align:start position:0%
it um my understanding is that
 
00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
there was no additional fee and please
 
00:44:02.430 --> 00:44:02.440 align:start position:0%
hope if I'm wrong U hopefully the
 
00:44:05.230 --> 00:44:05.240 align:start position:0%
executive director corrects me uh we'll
 
00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
have the director come up and answer
 
00:44:08.790 --> 00:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
some of yeah please but my understanding
 
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
is that there's no additional fee for
 
00:44:12.910 --> 00:44:12.920 align:start position:0%
the HHR
 
00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:15.640 align:start position:0%
machines thank you representative Spar
 
00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:18.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair is ggr is that after
 
00:44:21.030 --> 00:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
payout right yeah gross Gaming revenue
 
00:44:24.630 --> 00:44:24.640 align:start position:0%
okay is f payouts right okay follow up
 
00:44:27.870 --> 00:44:27.880 align:start position:0%
follow up um the other question backing
 
00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
to what representative shamber were
 
00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
saying does I I don't know the law but
 
00:44:33.790 --> 00:44:33.800 align:start position:0%
does it have to be either or as far as
 
00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
uh slot or HHR or could you do both
 
00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
that's I'm asking the same question you
 
00:44:40.750 --> 00:44:40.760 align:start position:0%
are okay I I again I just read this last
 
00:44:42.430 --> 00:44:42.440 align:start position:0%
night and I wish the prime sponsor was
 
00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:44.720 align:start position:0%
here and that but my my interpretation
 
00:44:45.990 --> 00:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
the way the way it's written in the
 
00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
sections that come to effect I think my
 
00:44:52.349 --> 00:44:52.359 align:start position:0%
interpretation is that it it it could be
 
00:44:55.589 --> 00:44:55.599 align:start position:0%
phased in over three years so they can
 
00:44:58.430 --> 00:44:58.440 align:start position:0%
have they can have both
 
00:45:01.390 --> 00:45:01.400 align:start position:0%
because the new the new statute is the
 
00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
beginning section one is the new statute
 
00:45:07.510 --> 00:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
that has to do with the the uh slot
 
00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
machines but the old statute the
 
00:45:13.750 --> 00:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
sections don't get phased out until 2020
 
00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:15.030 align:start position:0%
sections don't get phased out until 2020
January

00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
January
 
00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
2028 so so to me both are in place okay
 
00:45:23.670 --> 00:45:23.680 align:start position:0%
so a facility can phase out their
 
00:45:26.230 --> 00:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
historic racing machines over time and
 
00:45:29.309 --> 00:45:29.319 align:start position:0%
phase in machines is my interpretation
 
00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
but I asked it as a question myself
 
00:45:33.309 --> 00:45:33.319 align:start position:0%
because I think I think when I read the
 
00:45:36.109 --> 00:45:36.119 align:start position:0%
legislation that's what it said okay and
 
00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
if you look at the that's why it's
 
00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
looked at it's important to look in
 
00:45:42.190 --> 00:45:42.200 align:start position:0%
these in and if you're a new legislator
 
00:45:44.790 --> 00:45:44.800 align:start position:0%
it's important to look at the
 
00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:48.160 align:start position:0%
um at the uh well there's also in line
 
00:45:49.630 --> 00:45:49.640 align:start position:0%
16 on page five
 
00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
repeal you can see repeal what gets
 
00:45:57.349 --> 00:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
repealed line 16 through 19
 
00:46:01.349 --> 00:46:01.359 align:start position:0%
but repeal is not in section one it's
 
00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
it's part of the rest of the
 
00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:06.520 align:start position:0%
bill and the rest of Bill the existing
 
00:46:10.030 --> 00:46:10.040 align:start position:0%
bill is
 
00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
maintains historic racing until
 
00:46:19.270 --> 00:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
2028 okay so so I interpret this as yes
 
00:46:21.230 --> 00:46:21.240 align:start position:0%
the facilities can have both and they
 
00:46:23.230 --> 00:46:23.240 align:start position:0%
can phase in and out at their speed that
 
00:46:25.589 --> 00:46:25.599 align:start position:0%
they want to phase in and out of between
 
00:46:28.390 --> 00:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
these two
 
00:46:30.589 --> 00:46:30.599 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much thank you
 
00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:46:36.589 --> 00:46:36.599 align:start position:0%
all okay next I am going to ask Alicia
 
00:46:44.710 --> 00:46:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:46.910 --> 00:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
up thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
00:46:48.589 --> 00:46:48.599 align:start position:0%
committee Alicia Preston I represent the
 
00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:49.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire charitable gaming
 
00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
operators Association we are here in
 
00:46:54.950 --> 00:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
support of this bill as uh
 
00:46:57.109 --> 00:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
representative abrami pointed out this
 
00:46:58.470 --> 00:46:58.480 align:start position:0%
was a recommendation from a study
 
00:46:59.910 --> 00:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
commission that took kind of a deep dive
 
00:47:01.670 --> 00:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
into the industry and Spectrum gaming
 
00:47:03.470 --> 00:47:03.480 align:start position:0%
who was the third party consultant that
 
00:47:05.710 --> 00:47:05.720 align:start position:0%
they hired to look at the industry as a
 
00:47:07.549 --> 00:47:07.559 align:start position:0%
whole uh we think this is kind of a
 
00:47:10.430 --> 00:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
natural progression in the industry uh
 
00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:12.640 align:start position:0%
we also support the 30% tax rate while
 
00:47:15.589 --> 00:47:15.599 align:start position:0%
that is 5% higher than historic horse
 
00:47:18.430 --> 00:47:18.440 align:start position:0%
racing as noted there is more of a cost
 
00:47:21.069 --> 00:47:21.079 align:start position:0%
to run the HHR machines than there are
 
00:47:23.950 --> 00:47:23.960 align:start position:0%
um video video video Lottery terminals
 
00:47:25.470 --> 00:47:25.480 align:start position:0%
that's why everyone calls it slots video
 
00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
Lottery terminals and so we think that
 
00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:34.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:38.790 --> 00:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
00:47:42.990 --> 00:47:43.000 align:start position:0%
much thank
 
00:47:45.950 --> 00:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
you and next I'll invite director
 
00:48:00.030 --> 00:48:00.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:01.230 --> 00:48:01.240 align:start position:0%
um good morning Mr chairman members of
 
00:48:02.990 --> 00:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
the committee Charlie McIntyre Lottery
 
00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
director I owe you a pink
 
00:48:07.829 --> 00:48:07.839 align:start position:0%
card out after I'm done yeah when you're
 
00:48:09.549 --> 00:48:09.559 align:start position:0%
done it's fine I think I get drafted
 
00:48:13.349 --> 00:48:13.359 align:start position:0%
regardless you know um obviously uh
 
00:48:15.150 --> 00:48:15.160 align:start position:0%
these types of bills we don't take a a
 
00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
fundamental position on and um as a
 
00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
practical matter the fiscal note was
 
00:48:23.069 --> 00:48:23.079 align:start position:0%
delayed slightly I think we got it to
 
00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
you the day you printed the bill um but
 
00:48:27.829 --> 00:48:27.839 align:start position:0%
I actually would would like an
 
00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity to revise our Revenue
 
00:48:32.790 --> 00:48:32.800 align:start position:0%
estimates um dramatically
 
00:48:36.549 --> 00:48:36.559 align:start position:0%
upward um given the opening uh this past
 
00:48:36.559 --> 00:48:38.109 align:start position:0%
upward um given the opening uh this past
weekend

00:48:38.109 --> 00:48:38.119 align:start position:0%
weekend
 
00:48:38.119 --> 00:48:39.710 align:start position:0%
weekend
and

00:48:39.710 --> 00:48:39.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:48:42.750 --> 00:48:42.760 align:start position:0%
um what's to come the facilities that'll
 
00:48:45.910 --> 00:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
be opening soon um the revenue estimate
 
00:48:47.549 --> 00:48:47.559 align:start position:0%
is based on a Statewide average which is
 
00:48:49.710 --> 00:48:49.720 align:start position:0%
the way you would do it normally um but
 
00:48:52.069 --> 00:48:52.079 align:start position:0%
that includes facilities which have
 
00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
lower revenues there's two facilities in
 
00:48:56.309 --> 00:48:56.319 align:start position:0%
Hampton which are based you know it's
 
00:48:58.630 --> 00:48:58.640 align:start position:0%
not Hampton right now and there's a
 
00:49:00.190 --> 00:49:00.200 align:start position:0%
facility in Belmont that's kind of
 
00:49:02.670 --> 00:49:02.680 align:start position:0%
isolated as well um but the facilities
 
00:49:04.549 --> 00:49:04.559 align:start position:0%
along the border which
 
00:49:06.870 --> 00:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
derive I think the Nash's parking lots
 
00:49:10.710 --> 00:49:10.720 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts um significant
 
00:49:12.589 --> 00:49:12.599 align:start position:0%
population density from the our Southern
 
00:49:15.470 --> 00:49:15.480 align:start position:0%
neighbor um I have to revise upward
 
00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:16.270 align:start position:0%
neighbor um I have to revise upward
rather

00:49:16.270 --> 00:49:16.280 align:start position:0%
rather
 
00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
significantly um moreover when we did
 
00:49:21.910 --> 00:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note for HHR I believe our
 
00:49:25.390 --> 00:49:25.400 align:start position:0%
digital Revenue estimates were $150 per
 
00:49:28.069 --> 00:49:28.079 align:start position:0%
machine per day which was an accurate
 
00:49:30.750 --> 00:49:30.760 align:start position:0%
representation based off of then states
 
00:49:33.829 --> 00:49:33.839 align:start position:0%
that did HHR uh Kentucky Wyoming and I
 
00:49:33.839 --> 00:49:34.750 align:start position:0%
that did HHR uh Kentucky Wyoming and I
think

00:49:34.750 --> 00:49:34.760 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:49:37.109 --> 00:49:37.119 align:start position:0%
Arkansas um based on our existing
 
00:49:40.470 --> 00:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
revenues uh that is wildly
 
00:49:43.470 --> 00:49:43.480 align:start position:0%
low wildly low um if you take out the
 
00:49:45.589 --> 00:49:45.599 align:start position:0%
two Hampton facilities in Belmont the
 
00:49:47.710 --> 00:49:47.720 align:start position:0%
average per room is
 
00:49:51.390 --> 00:49:51.400 align:start position:0%
$287 per machine and growing rapidly um
 
00:49:53.069 --> 00:49:53.079 align:start position:0%
that is the reason for example the brook
 
00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
is expanding uh the rule of thumb in
 
00:49:58.789 --> 00:49:58.799 align:start position:0%
gaming is if you're over $250 a machine
 
00:50:01.069 --> 00:50:01.079 align:start position:0%
you add if you're below $250 a machine
 
00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
you subtract and so I would imagine as
 
00:50:05.349 --> 00:50:05.359 align:start position:0%
representative or former representative
 
00:50:08.670 --> 00:50:08.680 align:start position:0%
Bry said I would imagine there'll be
 
00:50:10.789 --> 00:50:10.799 align:start position:0%
facilities adding machines sooner rather
 
00:50:13.589 --> 00:50:13.599 align:start position:0%
than later but I will happily answer I I
 
00:50:15.710 --> 00:50:15.720 align:start position:0%
gather you folks have questions and I'll
 
00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
happily answer anything that I'm able to
 
00:50:19.950 --> 00:50:19.960 align:start position:0%
knowing this please this was not we
 
00:50:21.950 --> 00:50:21.960 align:start position:0%
didn't write this bill we just commented
 
00:50:24.829 --> 00:50:24.839 align:start position:0%
on it so that I ask you to if looking
 
00:50:26.270 --> 00:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
for logic and why something says
 
00:50:29.230 --> 00:50:29.240 align:start position:0%
something wasn't us that wrote it so um
 
00:50:31.710 --> 00:50:31.720 align:start position:0%
I I have a initial question here looking
 
00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:33.240 align:start position:0%
at the bill I have in front of me it
 
00:50:36.150 --> 00:50:36.160 align:start position:0%
looks like there's no fiscal note um we
 
00:50:39.309 --> 00:50:39.319 align:start position:0%
sent it over um like a few days late and
 
00:50:42.349 --> 00:50:42.359 align:start position:0%
I have been working with um my question
 
00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
yeah and certainly I and honestly it
 
00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:46.240 align:start position:0%
would be outdated right now only because
 
00:50:48.349 --> 00:50:48.359 align:start position:0%
of um the facility that open this
 
00:50:50.549 --> 00:50:50.559 align:start position:0%
weekend and there's a facility opening
 
00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
tonight uh in Rochester so it would be
 
00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
old information and I'm indulge I apolog
 
00:50:58.870 --> 00:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
oliz for not having it on time when do
 
00:51:00.349 --> 00:51:00.359 align:start position:0%
you think we could have an
 
00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
updated as soon as you what is give me a
 
00:51:04.829 --> 00:51:04.839 align:start position:0%
date this week if you if it's that's
 
00:51:07.309 --> 00:51:07.319 align:start position:0%
okay Tuesday Wednesday Thursday I could
 
00:51:10.390 --> 00:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
update it um that would be great the
 
00:51:11.950 --> 00:51:11.960 align:start position:0%
sooner probably the sooner the better
 
00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
sure close business tomorrow you'll have
 
00:51:18.589 --> 00:51:18.599 align:start position:0%
it thank you questions uh representative
 
00:51:21.670 --> 00:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
opal thank you Mr chairman um and thank
 
00:51:23.950 --> 00:51:23.960 align:start position:0%
you Mr director for taking my question I
 
00:51:27.910 --> 00:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
I I'm just curious um and maybe I'm
 
00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
thinking about this in the wrong way but
 
00:51:32.549 --> 00:51:32.559 align:start position:0%
I would assume that an opening like the
 
00:51:37.390 --> 00:51:37.400 align:start position:0%
Nash there's a novelty to it of sorts um
 
00:51:40.190 --> 00:51:40.200 align:start position:0%
but historically what's been the
 
00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
trajectory for these facilities is it
 
00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
steadily up is it sort of Big Splash
 
00:51:48.349 --> 00:51:48.359 align:start position:0%
initially and then it sort of levels off
 
00:51:50.950 --> 00:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
or goes down what what's the what's the
 
00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
history I mean it's a combination of
 
00:51:55.589 --> 00:51:55.599 align:start position:0%
both population density is it given in
 
00:51:57.630 --> 00:51:57.640 align:start position:0%
gaming the more Focus in an area the
 
00:52:00.390 --> 00:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
obviously the higher the revenue um and
 
00:52:02.349 --> 00:52:02.359 align:start position:0%
the Nash may represent what I would
 
00:52:04.309 --> 00:52:04.319 align:start position:0%
characterize as a unique Place only
 
00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
because I have some inside knowledge one
 
00:52:08.710 --> 00:52:08.720 align:start position:0%
of my good friends was a senior vice
 
00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:11.160 align:start position:0%
president of a very large gaming company
 
00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
which I won't name because I don't want
 
00:52:14.750 --> 00:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
to out him but when he did a review when
 
00:52:17.190 --> 00:52:17.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was looking at casinos he said
 
00:52:21.150 --> 00:52:21.160 align:start position:0%
the best location in the state was nsha
 
00:52:22.589 --> 00:52:22.599 align:start position:0%
uh and then it was one of the best he'd
 
00:52:25.230 --> 00:52:25.240 align:start position:0%
ever seen and so it might also just be
 
00:52:27.789 --> 00:52:27.799 align:start position:0%
that nashwa has
 
00:52:29.309 --> 00:52:29.319 align:start position:0%
it's not just nsha it's the southern
 
00:52:32.510 --> 00:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
border if you put a pin in nsha north of
 
00:52:35.069 --> 00:52:35.079 align:start position:0%
that circle is like 600,000 people below
 
00:52:37.390 --> 00:52:37.400 align:start position:0%
that's almost two million and so you're
 
00:52:39.470 --> 00:52:39.480 align:start position:0%
deriving a lot of people from
 
00:52:42.109 --> 00:52:42.119 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts um to be sure opening
 
00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
night's always a but I would tell you
 
00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
that I was there when they opened and it
 
00:52:48.430 --> 00:52:48.440 align:start position:0%
was supposed to be qu a soft opening and
 
00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
within an hour the place was packed and
 
00:52:52.670 --> 00:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
over the weekend there were lines for
 
00:52:56.549 --> 00:52:56.559 align:start position:0%
machines which I would
 
00:52:58.710 --> 00:52:58.720 align:start position:0%
I would guess that a lot of folks are
 
00:53:01.789 --> 00:53:01.799 align:start position:0%
tired of driving to Boston the I I grew
 
00:53:04.109 --> 00:53:04.119 align:start position:0%
up in quinsey uh outside Boston and
 
00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
ever's not easy to get to and Foxwoods
 
00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
is even less so and so I would imagine
 
00:53:10.750 --> 00:53:10.760 align:start position:0%
that you're you're driving a lot of
 
00:53:13.030 --> 00:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
traffic from the northern middle sex
 
00:53:16.270 --> 00:53:16.280 align:start position:0%
Essex counties and so but once again the
 
00:53:17.990 --> 00:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
information is only like four days old
 
00:53:21.309 --> 00:53:21.319 align:start position:0%
so it's I'm at a you know dis Advantage
 
00:53:27.670 --> 00:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
followup Mr follow up um but um again
 
00:53:29.470 --> 00:53:29.480 align:start position:0%
yeah in the Hampshire whether it's
 
00:53:32.750 --> 00:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
Southern Tier or Lebanon or elsewhere
 
00:53:35.589 --> 00:53:35.599 align:start position:0%
what what has been the history of uh you
 
00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
know and I I know obviously video
 
00:53:40.430 --> 00:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
terminals slot machines are new or you
 
00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
know not don't exist yet um but for
 
00:53:46.390 --> 00:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
historic horse racing for these others I
 
00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:48.160 align:start position:0%
mean do they do they tend to sort of
 
00:53:51.230 --> 00:53:51.240 align:start position:0%
find a level and then they do they do
 
00:53:53.950 --> 00:53:53.960 align:start position:0%
and certainly but that level opening
 
00:53:55.069 --> 00:53:55.079 align:start position:0%
night is opening night so you don't
 
00:53:57.630 --> 00:53:57.640 align:start position:0%
count that right and so so month over
 
00:53:59.829 --> 00:53:59.839 align:start position:0%
month there's growth and we still have
 
00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
growth the Spectrum report that was
 
00:54:03.670 --> 00:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
referenced by representative abami I was
 
00:54:05.069 --> 00:54:05.079 align:start position:0%
on that commission as well as
 
00:54:06.510 --> 00:54:06.520 align:start position:0%
representative jigi and representative
 
00:54:10.309 --> 00:54:10.319 align:start position:0%
jet um said the market for New Hampshire
 
00:54:13.990 --> 00:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
is probably 6,000 machines give or take
 
00:54:15.950 --> 00:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
if they were ideally placed across the
 
00:54:18.030 --> 00:54:18.040 align:start position:0%
state for maximum efficiency that's
 
00:54:20.430 --> 00:54:20.440 align:start position:0%
never going to happen the markets but um
 
00:54:22.030 --> 00:54:22.040 align:start position:0%
that's what it looks like so we're still
 
00:54:25.349 --> 00:54:25.359 align:start position:0%
well below that thank
 
00:54:28.950 --> 00:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
you I'll try this again represenative
 
00:54:31.589 --> 00:54:31.599 align:start position:0%
shamberg thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:54:34.829 --> 00:54:34.839 align:start position:0%
director for taking this question uh on
 
00:54:40.190 --> 00:54:40.200 align:start position:0%
page three line 10 it mentions 1/4 of 1%
 
00:54:42.109 --> 00:54:42.119 align:start position:0%
of the amount collected payment will go
 
00:54:46.470 --> 00:54:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:50.349 --> 00:54:50.359 align:start position:0%
Services what is the present amount that
 
00:54:54.069 --> 00:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
goes to these uh problem gaming services
 
00:54:57.630 --> 00:54:57.640 align:start position:0%
and would this bill increase the
 
00:54:59.870 --> 00:54:59.880 align:start position:0%
amount as I understanding currently the
 
00:55:00.829 --> 00:55:00.839 align:start position:0%
amount is
 
00:55:04.109 --> 00:55:04.119 align:start position:0%
$150,000 annually uh which is budgeted
 
00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
it's budgeted from our revenues as a bud
 
00:55:10.910 --> 00:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
budget item uh and this would that
 
00:55:13.270 --> 00:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
percent would be more okay I haven't
 
00:55:15.349 --> 00:55:15.359 align:start position:0%
done the back of the envelope math on it
 
00:55:18.829 --> 00:55:18.839 align:start position:0%
yet but it would be more certainly as a
 
00:55:20.470 --> 00:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
part of the fiscal note Mr chair if that
 
00:55:22.990 --> 00:55:23.000 align:start position:0%
pleas the committee I can do that too as
 
00:55:25.069 --> 00:55:25.079 align:start position:0%
part of the fiscal note as to what we
 
00:55:27.829 --> 00:55:27.839 align:start position:0%
anticipate that number would be yeah it
 
00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:30.880 align:start position:0%
we'd also like the historical uh amount
 
00:55:32.670 --> 00:55:32.680 align:start position:0%
of money that was spent how much was
 
00:55:34.309 --> 00:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
returned to the general fund or yeah
 
00:55:37.349 --> 00:55:37.359 align:start position:0%
whatever okay followup Mr chairman
 
00:55:39.510 --> 00:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
follow up sir thank you sir for taking
 
00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
this question uh on line
 
00:55:47.349 --> 00:55:47.359 align:start position:0%
14 uh d uh the remainder of the amount
 
00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
collected to the Lottery Commission for
 
00:55:51.029 --> 00:55:51.039 align:start position:0%
use according to the special fund
 
00:55:55.029 --> 00:55:55.039 align:start position:0%
established under RSA 284 colon
 
00:55:57.430 --> 00:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
2-j uh
 
00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:00.400 align:start position:0%
your expenses come out first it for the
 
00:56:06.349 --> 00:56:06.359 align:start position:0%
Lottery Commission in regards to this
 
00:56:08.950 --> 00:56:08.960 align:start position:0%
and the the part of the question I'm
 
00:56:11.589 --> 00:56:11.599 align:start position:0%
trying to get to is what percent goes
 
00:56:19.270 --> 00:56:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:22.910 --> 00:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
ETF doesn't 284 allows you to withdraw
 
00:56:24.829 --> 00:56:24.839 align:start position:0%
first right sure it looks like it would
 
00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
be um 60 um 60%
 
00:56:33.069 --> 00:56:33.079 align:start position:0%
of the amount set aside for charities in
 
00:56:36.190 --> 00:56:36.200 align:start position:0%
the state would go to the ETF
 
00:56:41.630 --> 00:56:41.640 align:start position:0%
fund I say that if I'm representative so
 
00:56:45.270 --> 00:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
if you take out it's so you get a dollar
 
00:56:48.270 --> 00:56:48.280 align:start position:0%
SE on by the terms of this bill 70 cents
 
00:56:51.230 --> 00:56:51.240 align:start position:0%
goes to the operator 30 cents goes to
 
00:56:54.670 --> 00:56:54.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:57.470 --> 00:56:57.480 align:start position:0%
Charities my question Mr Mr chairman is
 
00:56:59.910 --> 00:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
of that 30% that goes
 
00:57:02.750 --> 00:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
to you get to pull out your expenses
 
00:57:05.069 --> 00:57:05.079 align:start position:0%
from that right no no so we don't
 
00:57:07.950 --> 00:57:07.960 align:start position:0%
separately expense this
 
00:57:10.589 --> 00:57:10.599 align:start position:0%
function so last year our net revenues
 
00:57:15.230 --> 00:57:15.240 align:start position:0%
were $27 million our expenses were 15 so
 
00:57:18.190 --> 00:57:18.200 align:start position:0%
for us to parse out what we spend on
 
00:57:19.789 --> 00:57:19.799 align:start position:0%
Char little gambling versus what we
 
00:57:21.589 --> 00:57:21.599 align:start position:0%
spend on lottery is just an act there's
 
00:57:24.029 --> 00:57:24.039 align:start position:0%
no point our investigators do both
 
00:57:25.950 --> 00:57:25.960 align:start position:0%
functions our Auditors do both functions
 
00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:26.789 align:start position:0%
functions our Auditors do both functions
our

00:57:26.789 --> 00:57:26.799 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:57:29.910 --> 00:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
I do both functions so it's always just
 
00:57:33.430 --> 00:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
charge the Lottery account for it that's
 
00:57:35.910 --> 00:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
all if if I
 
00:57:38.710 --> 00:57:38.720 align:start position:0%
might to follow up on
 
00:57:41.390 --> 00:57:41.400 align:start position:0%
that that particular section talks about
 
00:57:44.910 --> 00:57:44.920 align:start position:0%
door uh um dog and horse
 
00:57:47.950 --> 00:57:47.960 align:start position:0%
racing and that's that's the title of it
 
00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:50.960 align:start position:0%
but it actually refers to the funding of
 
00:57:53.309 --> 00:57:53.319 align:start position:0%
the gaming
 
00:57:57.109 --> 00:57:57.119 align:start position:0%
commission I'm sorry which section the
 
00:58:01.349 --> 00:58:01.359 align:start position:0%
uh something 23j got to put my glasses
 
00:58:04.190 --> 00:58:04.200 align:start position:0%
on here is 20 20j is the education trust
 
00:58:08.549 --> 00:58:08.559 align:start position:0%
fund as I understand it 21j yes I don't
 
00:58:08.559 --> 00:58:19.390 align:start position:0%
fund as I understand it 21j yes I don't
think

00:58:19.390 --> 00:58:19.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:22.990 --> 00:58:23.000 align:start position:0%
so I've I looked that up last night if
 
00:58:27.710 --> 00:58:27.720 align:start position:0%
you want yeah yeah it first says that
 
00:58:31.190 --> 00:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
the lottery expenses will be taken
 
00:58:33.390 --> 00:58:33.400 align:start position:0%
out from the
 
00:58:36.510 --> 00:58:36.520 align:start position:0%
special this special fund which is the
 
00:58:40.190 --> 00:58:40.200 align:start position:0%
money that ends up at the Lottery
 
00:58:43.309 --> 00:58:43.319 align:start position:0%
Commission and then the rest of it goes
 
00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:47.200 align:start position:0%
to the education trust fund unless you
 
00:58:48.630 --> 00:58:48.640 align:start position:0%
don't have enough to pay for your
 
00:58:50.309 --> 00:58:50.319 align:start position:0%
retirement benefits which I think
 
00:58:52.829 --> 00:58:52.839 align:start position:0%
probably never happens
 
00:58:54.870 --> 00:58:54.880 align:start position:0%
right this P I don't think I can ever
 
00:58:57.630 --> 00:58:57.640 align:start position:0%
retire I'm doing this from 15 years now
 
00:58:58.630 --> 00:58:58.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:59:00.630 --> 00:59:00.640 align:start position:0%
representative any other follow up on
 
00:59:06.109 --> 00:59:06.119 align:start position:0%
that no here yeah that
 
00:59:09.069 --> 00:59:09.079 align:start position:0%
thank Southworth starts with an thank
 
00:59:10.910 --> 00:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I asked you
 
00:59:13.670 --> 00:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
in the hall the other day um you're ever
 
00:59:16.430 --> 00:59:16.440 align:start position:0%
changing Revenue estimates those
 
00:59:18.589 --> 00:59:18.599 align:start position:0%
basically takes to consideration one
 
00:59:20.309 --> 00:59:20.319 align:start position:0%
machine being phased in and the other
 
00:59:23.309 --> 00:59:23.319 align:start position:0%
being phased out so really the um
 
00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
estimates are a combination of those two
 
00:59:29.390 --> 00:59:29.400 align:start position:0%
things correct thank you and the and the
 
00:59:32.309 --> 00:59:32.319 align:start position:0%
perceived growth for so the machine
 
00:59:33.710 --> 00:59:33.720 align:start position:0%
we're not replacing machines the
 
00:59:35.309 --> 00:59:35.319 align:start position:0%
machines are most of them are going to
 
00:59:37.589 --> 00:59:37.599 align:start position:0%
stay it's just you're changing the
 
00:59:39.589 --> 00:59:39.599 align:start position:0%
content in the machine itself like the
 
00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:42.720 align:start position:0%
Box isn't going to change most of them
 
00:59:44.190 --> 00:59:44.200 align:start position:0%
the communications is going to change
 
00:59:45.430 --> 00:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
the surveillance isn't going to change
 
00:59:47.349 --> 00:59:47.359 align:start position:0%
it's literally just the content inside
 
00:59:50.230 --> 00:59:50.240 align:start position:0%
and the math behind it is what changes
 
00:59:52.549 --> 00:59:52.559 align:start position:0%
and the content by providers there many
 
00:59:56.150 --> 00:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
more of them that do that stuff so
 
00:59:56.160 --> 00:59:57.510 align:start position:0%
more of them that do that stuff so
representative

00:59:57.510 --> 00:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:59:59.670 --> 00:59:59.680 align:start position:0%
Elber thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:00:02.309 --> 01:00:02.319 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um there are
 
01:00:06.309 --> 01:00:06.319 align:start position:0%
three if there's time you mentioned that
 
01:00:10.829 --> 01:00:10.839 align:start position:0%
uh saturation is about 6,000 machines
 
01:00:13.270 --> 01:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
yeah give or take how many are there now
 
01:00:16.230 --> 01:00:16.240 align:start position:0%
throughout the state as of well can I
 
01:00:20.029 --> 01:00:20.039 align:start position:0%
say as of tonight at 5: um there'll be
 
01:00:20.039 --> 01:00:22.270 align:start position:0%
say as of tonight at 5: um there'll be
34

01:00:22.270 --> 01:00:22.280 align:start position:0%
34
 
01:00:24.789 --> 01:00:24.799 align:start position:0%
3500 followup Mr
 
01:00:27.710 --> 01:00:27.720 align:start position:0%
chair just going to go so there's
 
01:00:29.910 --> 01:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
there's room for at this point about
 
01:00:33.789 --> 01:00:33.799 align:start position:0%
2600 more based on that 6,000 C if they
 
01:00:35.430 --> 01:00:35.440 align:start position:0%
were done completely strategically
 
01:00:38.950 --> 01:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
perfectly I think yes um but that the
 
01:00:41.150 --> 01:00:41.160 align:start position:0%
market will dictate that okay and these
 
01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
operators are very good at knowing what
 
01:00:44.309 --> 01:00:44.319 align:start position:0%
the market can dictate and not dictate
 
01:00:46.230 --> 01:00:46.240 align:start position:0%
and address
 
01:00:49.829 --> 01:00:49.839 align:start position:0%
accordingly followup Mr chair go ahead
 
01:00:49.839 --> 01:00:50.789 align:start position:0%
accordingly followup Mr chair go ahead
thank

01:00:50.789 --> 01:00:50.799 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:00:53.069 --> 01:00:53.079 align:start position:0%
you at what
 
01:00:56.630 --> 01:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
point do does saturation
 
01:00:59.430 --> 01:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
actually happen I mean there's the
 
01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
novelty of a new
 
01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
casino we may be able to get 25 2600
 
01:01:09.950 --> 01:01:09.960 align:start position:0%
more machines but is there a point at
 
01:01:13.069 --> 01:01:13.079 align:start position:0%
which nobody else is interested or
 
01:01:15.789 --> 01:01:15.799 align:start position:0%
nobody is interested in gambling more
 
01:01:19.670 --> 01:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
than they do now it's a good question um
 
01:01:23.109 --> 01:01:23.119 align:start position:0%
I and that varies by state and tolerance
 
01:01:25.710 --> 01:01:25.720 align:start position:0%
and appetite of the consumer for example
 
01:01:28.190 --> 01:01:28.200 align:start position:0%
the state of Oklahoma I think has 65
 
01:01:30.390 --> 01:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
casinos um because they have Tribal
 
01:01:32.510 --> 01:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
casinos and there are great number of
 
01:01:36.270 --> 01:01:36.280 align:start position:0%
tribes in Oklahoma uh and whereas you
 
01:01:37.990 --> 01:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
know Connecticut has
 
01:01:41.150 --> 01:01:41.160 align:start position:0%
two it varies by state and by appetite
 
01:01:43.309 --> 01:01:43.319 align:start position:0%
and you'll see the fewer in a
 
01:01:46.710 --> 01:01:46.720 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction the larger they tend to
 
01:01:51.150 --> 01:01:51.160 align:start position:0%
be one more thank you follow up
 
01:01:53.269 --> 01:01:53.279 align:start position:0%
Nashville right now has three open
 
01:01:55.950 --> 01:01:55.960 align:start position:0%
casinos the two big ones the lucky moves
 
01:01:57.269 --> 01:01:57.279 align:start position:0%
is around the corner from my house
 
01:02:02.230 --> 01:02:02.240 align:start position:0%
pretty much so I see all the cars there
 
01:02:05.309 --> 01:02:05.319 align:start position:0%
um presumably that smaller Casino the
 
01:02:06.589 --> 01:02:06.599 align:start position:0%
Moose will be
 
01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
closing Gate City is still there yes
 
01:02:16.349 --> 01:02:16.359 align:start position:0%
is what might be happening in terms of a
 
01:02:19.710 --> 01:02:19.720 align:start position:0%
shift to people going to the Nash is it
 
01:02:22.510 --> 01:02:22.520 align:start position:0%
what kind of impact is it likely or not
 
01:02:25.510 --> 01:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
to have on Gate City it will have an
 
01:02:28.630 --> 01:02:28.640 align:start position:0%
impact done Gate City no question um it
 
01:02:30.589 --> 01:02:30.599 align:start position:0%
remains to be seen yet it's a nicer
 
01:02:34.829 --> 01:02:34.839 align:start position:0%
facility just you objectively um there's
 
01:02:36.670 --> 01:02:36.680 align:start position:0%
only so much money to go around in
 
01:02:39.349 --> 01:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
discretionary income so have an impact I
 
01:02:41.109 --> 01:02:41.119 align:start position:0%
don't know the exact answer because I
 
01:02:42.589 --> 01:02:42.599 align:start position:0%
don't know what gate City's reaction
 
01:02:44.589 --> 01:02:44.599 align:start position:0%
will be most of the time these folks
 
01:02:48.269 --> 01:02:48.279 align:start position:0%
actually react and um they're likely to
 
01:02:50.029 --> 01:02:50.039 align:start position:0%
move to another facility I've heard
 
01:02:51.710 --> 01:02:51.720 align:start position:0%
stories about it I haven't seen
 
01:02:54.190 --> 01:02:54.200 align:start position:0%
applications yet so till it's on my desk
 
01:02:56.349 --> 01:02:56.359 align:start position:0%
I don't tend to hold it as gosp truth
 
01:02:58.430 --> 01:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
yet but um I would imagine they'll move
 
01:03:00.870 --> 01:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
to a nicer facility and build that out
 
01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:01.750 align:start position:0%
to a nicer facility and build that out
to

01:03:01.750 --> 01:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:03:05.069 --> 01:03:05.079 align:start position:0%
compete thank you thank you Mr chair
 
01:03:07.950 --> 01:03:07.960 align:start position:0%
representative Aly has a question two
 
01:03:11.789 --> 01:03:11.799 align:start position:0%
two actually on the first one before I
 
01:03:14.750 --> 01:03:14.760 align:start position:0%
forget it again on
 
01:03:17.230 --> 01:03:17.240 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:03:19.589 --> 01:03:19.599 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:03:26.630 --> 01:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
um oh dear I have forgotten it so um
 
01:03:34.109 --> 01:03:34.119 align:start position:0%
the O the other question that that I had
 
01:03:39.829 --> 01:03:39.839 align:start position:0%
was the amount of oh I should write
 
01:03:42.829 --> 01:03:42.839 align:start position:0%
these things down uh there there is a
 
01:03:47.109 --> 01:03:47.119 align:start position:0%
section in here somewhere that says that
 
01:03:47.119 --> 01:03:49.069 align:start position:0%
section in here somewhere that says that
the

01:03:49.069 --> 01:03:49.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:03:49.079 --> 01:03:51.190 align:start position:0%
the
revenue

01:03:51.190 --> 01:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:53.029 align:start position:0%
revenue
um

01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:53.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:56.309 --> 01:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
collected is
 
01:03:59.549 --> 01:03:59.559 align:start position:0%
is going to
 
01:04:05.349 --> 01:04:05.359 align:start position:0%
be um oh well there's the 30% issue
 
01:04:07.710 --> 01:04:07.720 align:start position:0%
there are other bills out there that ask
 
01:04:09.710 --> 01:04:09.720 align:start position:0%
for considerably more is that going to
 
01:04:10.910 --> 01:04:10.920 align:start position:0%
be a
 
01:04:12.589 --> 01:04:12.599 align:start position:0%
difference is it going to be a
 
01:04:15.589 --> 01:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
difference significant yes
 
01:04:19.470 --> 01:04:19.480 align:start position:0%
yeah so if we went up to the
 
01:04:22.910 --> 01:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
50% that the governor wants the thing
 
01:04:27.390 --> 01:04:27.400 align:start position:0%
the governor in hb2 is 45% 45 that's yes
 
01:04:30.269 --> 01:04:30.279 align:start position:0%
and that's certainly at um after a lot
 
01:04:32.230 --> 01:04:32.240 align:start position:0%
of research and effort into what is
 
01:04:34.190 --> 01:04:34.200 align:start position:0%
essentially the marketplace in right now
 
01:04:38.789 --> 01:04:38.799 align:start position:0%
for video Lottery terminals um 25% on
 
01:04:42.029 --> 01:04:42.039 align:start position:0%
HHR is the lowest in this New England
 
01:04:44.789 --> 01:04:44.799 align:start position:0%
for what the state gets as as a
 
01:04:46.630 --> 01:04:46.640 align:start position:0%
take for a
 
01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:48.309 align:start position:0%
take for a
machine

01:04:48.309 --> 01:04:48.319 align:start position:0%
machine
 
01:04:52.549 --> 01:04:52.559 align:start position:0%
right um and
 
01:04:55.789 --> 01:04:55.799 align:start position:0%
second the LA the I think this is the
 
01:04:57.750 --> 01:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
same language we've had all along a
 
01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:00.640 align:start position:0%
license shall not be transferred or sold
 
01:05:03.990 --> 01:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
is there no way to write it to keep
 
01:05:06.870 --> 01:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
large conglomerates from taking over
 
01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:08.390 align:start position:0%
large conglomerates from taking over
everything

01:05:08.390 --> 01:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
everything
 
01:05:10.950 --> 01:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
um I would almost suggest that the
 
01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
animals left the baring that one but um
 
01:05:15.990 --> 01:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
that was that was the that was the
 
01:05:18.230 --> 01:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
attempt of the bill yeah to your
 
01:05:19.269 --> 01:05:19.279 align:start position:0%
question that was the attempt of the
 
01:05:22.710 --> 01:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
bill but I will tell you this is that
 
01:05:24.829 --> 01:05:24.839 align:start position:0%
the large operators have brought it in
 
01:05:27.390 --> 01:05:27.400 align:start position:0%
professionalism that was candidly
 
01:05:29.630 --> 01:05:29.640 align:start position:0%
lacking in some of the smaller mom and
 
01:05:32.990 --> 01:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
pop shops uh and it hasn't been all
 
01:05:34.029 --> 01:05:34.039 align:start position:0%
these are
 
01:05:37.430 --> 01:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
very talented well vetted professionals
 
01:05:40.190 --> 01:05:40.200 align:start position:0%
that are operating right now so
 
01:05:42.309 --> 01:05:42.319 align:start position:0%
understanding the fear that out of state
 
01:05:43.910 --> 01:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
has come in but they actually know what
 
01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:46.150 align:start position:0%
has come in but they actually know what
they're

01:05:46.150 --> 01:05:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:50.390 --> 01:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
doing okay uh follow up and that yes
 
01:05:55.230 --> 01:05:55.240 align:start position:0%
follow the last one is about the problem
 
01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:56.470 align:start position:0%
follow the last one is about the problem
gaming

01:05:56.470 --> 01:05:56.480 align:start position:0%
gaming
 
01:06:00.470 --> 01:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
amount yes um we have no problem gaming
 
01:06:02.430 --> 01:06:02.440 align:start position:0%
help now apparently there may be a
 
01:06:04.349 --> 01:06:04.359 align:start position:0%
brochure around somewhere that you can
 
01:06:07.269 --> 01:06:07.279 align:start position:0%
hand to somebody if they actually decide
 
01:06:09.950 --> 01:06:09.960 align:start position:0%
to come into the casino to say I've got
 
01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:10.710 align:start position:0%
to come into the casino to say I've got
a

01:06:10.710 --> 01:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:06:13.029 --> 01:06:13.039 align:start position:0%
problem which seems like a weird place
 
01:06:15.109 --> 01:06:15.119 align:start position:0%
to go if you have a problem and you know
 
01:06:19.190 --> 01:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
it um but is there
 
01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:20.710 align:start position:0%
it um but is there
any

01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:20.720 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
um place in the country that is
 
01:06:26.670 --> 01:06:26.680 align:start position:0%
sufficiently enough like with all of
 
01:06:29.950 --> 01:06:29.960 align:start position:0%
these casinos all over the place that
 
01:06:32.950 --> 01:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
are of significant size I don't think
 
01:06:35.910 --> 01:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
the Indian ones are
 
01:06:38.349 --> 01:06:38.359 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
01:06:42.190 --> 01:06:42.200 align:start position:0%
that we we could get an idea of what
 
01:06:45.230 --> 01:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
they're doing about problem gaming and
 
01:06:46.950 --> 01:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
how much we ought to put in there
 
01:06:49.150 --> 01:06:49.160 align:start position:0%
because if we put in there too little
 
01:06:50.750 --> 01:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
we're never going to be able to get it
 
01:06:53.390 --> 01:06:53.400 align:start position:0%
changed no I I agree with your OB to be
 
01:06:57.589 --> 01:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
sure um and the ulty is in my job doing
 
01:06:59.670 --> 01:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
both candid Lees being the director of
 
01:07:01.230 --> 01:07:01.240 align:start position:0%
the lottery and also
 
01:07:04.470 --> 01:07:04.480 align:start position:0%
running problem gambling I shouldn't be
 
01:07:07.069 --> 01:07:07.079 align:start position:0%
both jobs it it would be a conflict
 
01:07:08.990 --> 01:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
these people were perceiv a conflict I'm
 
01:07:10.990 --> 01:07:11.000 align:start position:0%
fully in support of the measure and have
 
01:07:12.789 --> 01:07:12.799 align:start position:0%
been forever it's just it's difficult to
 
01:07:15.190 --> 01:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
do both jobs simultaneously and not look
 
01:07:18.150 --> 01:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
like you're being disingenuous at one
 
01:07:23.829 --> 01:07:23.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:27.630 --> 01:07:27.640 align:start position:0%
but I should have turned that off sorry
 
01:07:30.589 --> 01:07:30.599 align:start position:0%
um but do
 
01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
we we we have no one else that's the
 
01:07:36.630 --> 01:07:36.640 align:start position:0%
problem in New Hampshire and you tried
 
01:07:38.190 --> 01:07:38.200 align:start position:0%
to recruit some people from
 
01:07:39.910 --> 01:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts but it doesn't seem to
 
01:07:44.029 --> 01:07:44.039 align:start position:0%
have worked uh not not so far correct um
 
01:07:48.269 --> 01:07:48.279 align:start position:0%
not so far yeah and the budget in that
 
01:07:50.510 --> 01:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
we have isn't sufficient to address the
 
01:07:52.510 --> 01:07:52.520 align:start position:0%
issue because you need to have somebody
 
01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
operationally stand it up train some
 
01:07:57.150 --> 01:07:57.160 align:start position:0%
folks to do do this uh there are issues
 
01:07:58.670 --> 01:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
of what I would characterize is
 
01:08:00.950 --> 01:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
comorbidity a person who gambles is more
 
01:08:02.910 --> 01:08:02.920 align:start position:0%
likely to smoke person who gambles is
 
01:08:05.190 --> 01:08:05.200 align:start position:0%
more likely to drink um right and so
 
01:08:07.549 --> 01:08:07.559 align:start position:0%
there's issues that that you could
 
01:08:07.559 --> 01:08:09.150 align:start position:0%
there's issues that that you could
address

01:08:09.150 --> 01:08:09.160 align:start position:0%
address
 
01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:11.630 align:start position:0%
address
globally

01:08:11.630 --> 01:08:11.640 align:start position:0%
globally
 
01:08:16.789 --> 01:08:16.799 align:start position:0%
yeah but you think that the 3/4 of a
 
01:08:18.950 --> 01:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
percent is enough prob I'd have to do
 
01:08:20.870 --> 01:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
the math on it but I think I do believe
 
01:08:23.470 --> 01:08:23.480 align:start position:0%
so based on what I know the the numbers
 
01:08:26.630 --> 01:08:26.640 align:start position:0%
to be but I certainly as I suggested
 
01:08:28.990 --> 01:08:29.000 align:start position:0%
I'll do the fiscal note um and I'll get
 
01:08:31.030 --> 01:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
it to the chairman and committee members
 
01:08:32.470 --> 01:08:32.480 align:start position:0%
by close business tomorrow I'll include
 
01:08:34.149 --> 01:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
with that Ma what I think that math
 
01:08:34.159 --> 01:08:35.709 align:start position:0%
with that Ma what I think that math
looks

01:08:35.709 --> 01:08:35.719 align:start position:0%
looks
 
01:08:39.709 --> 01:08:39.719 align:start position:0%
like okay thank you um
 
01:08:45.550 --> 01:08:45.560 align:start position:0%
my my city already had a problem with
 
01:08:50.349 --> 01:08:50.359 align:start position:0%
the small HRM machine place
 
01:08:54.269 --> 01:08:54.279 align:start position:0%
on and our poverty agency being unable
 
01:08:55.749 --> 01:08:55.759 align:start position:0%
to keep up with the number number of
 
01:08:57.269 --> 01:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
people who became
 
01:08:59.349 --> 01:08:59.359 align:start position:0%
addicted thank
 
01:09:02.430 --> 01:09:02.440 align:start position:0%
you representative M yeah thank you
 
01:09:04.829 --> 01:09:04.839 align:start position:0%
director McIntyre uh I appreciate the
 
01:09:07.950 --> 01:09:07.960 align:start position:0%
work you're doing to uh oversee this
 
01:09:10.430 --> 01:09:10.440 align:start position:0%
expanding operation my question relates
 
01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
to your capacity to handle the
 
01:09:15.309 --> 01:09:15.319 align:start position:0%
expansion I I had a long talk with Jeff
 
01:09:18.590 --> 01:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
Lynn the president of Exacta saying that
 
01:09:21.669 --> 01:09:21.679 align:start position:0%
um using these this model of a Off Track
 
01:09:24.990 --> 01:09:25.000 align:start position:0%
Betting machine it's less burdensome on
 
01:09:27.950 --> 01:09:27.960 align:start position:0%
the um operators and the regulatory
 
01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
regulatory authority to maintain
 
01:09:33.630 --> 01:09:33.640 align:start position:0%
Integrity in the games and if we went to
 
01:09:36.110 --> 01:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
VTS that'd be much more of a burden on
 
01:09:37.789 --> 01:09:37.799 align:start position:0%
our regulatory system here in New
 
01:09:40.749 --> 01:09:40.759 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so my question is uh have you
 
01:09:42.990 --> 01:09:43.000 align:start position:0%
thought about the capacity you need to
 
01:09:46.829 --> 01:09:46.839 align:start position:0%
oversee uh 6,000 V Lottery Terminals and
 
01:09:48.789 --> 01:09:48.799 align:start position:0%
uh can you at some point give us some
 
01:09:51.149 --> 01:09:51.159 align:start position:0%
guidance on what budgeting we should
 
01:09:53.669 --> 01:09:53.679 align:start position:0%
have for that operation I mean certainly
 
01:09:55.590 --> 01:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
contained in the fiscal no which I get
 
01:09:58.270 --> 01:09:58.280 align:start position:0%
to you on time um is a few extra
 
01:10:01.110 --> 01:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
employees to add to my our staff to
 
01:10:03.990 --> 01:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
review this um and some respects it's
 
01:10:06.709 --> 01:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
harder some respects it's easier um
 
01:10:09.350 --> 01:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
managing the pools regarding stor horse
 
01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
racing the actual pools players play
 
01:10:13.510 --> 01:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
against each other in it does take some
 
01:10:15.550 --> 01:10:15.560 align:start position:0%
work so that would be less of a burden
 
01:10:16.510 --> 01:10:16.520 align:start position:0%
and we've already gone through the
 
01:10:18.590 --> 01:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
effort of placing a significant number
 
01:10:21.390 --> 01:10:21.400 align:start position:0%
of the machines and their surveillance
 
01:10:23.669 --> 01:10:23.679 align:start position:0%
everything is reviewed by us they can't
 
01:10:27.270 --> 01:10:27.280 align:start position:0%
move a machine without telling us um has
 
01:10:29.590 --> 01:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
most of that work's already been done um
 
01:10:31.830 --> 01:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
we have another slew of initiatives in
 
01:10:34.110 --> 01:10:34.120 align:start position:0%
the lottery that are draining our meager
 
01:10:36.189 --> 01:10:36.199 align:start position:0%
resources uh we launched a new website
 
01:10:38.709 --> 01:10:38.719 align:start position:0%
last week we're launching a new app
 
01:10:40.430 --> 01:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
coming up we're changing out our gaming
 
01:10:42.189 --> 01:10:42.199 align:start position:0%
system in the store
 
01:10:44.550 --> 01:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
stores moving to a new platform on the
 
01:10:47.830 --> 01:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
website and the our uh online platform
 
01:10:50.709 --> 01:10:50.719 align:start position:0%
so it's not just the HDR side or the
 
01:10:52.910 --> 01:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
gaming side that's been busy but I think
 
01:10:55.950 --> 01:10:55.960 align:start position:0%
we're in good shape you know um but if I
 
01:10:57.630 --> 01:10:57.640 align:start position:0%
would if I thought it was a problem I
 
01:10:59.990 --> 01:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
would suggest to you I do have to that
 
01:11:01.709 --> 01:11:01.719 align:start position:0%
point representes I do have a number of
 
01:11:04.189 --> 01:11:04.199 align:start position:0%
open positions that I only fill if
 
01:11:06.350 --> 01:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
needed and most of them are in chartable
 
01:11:09.270 --> 01:11:09.280 align:start position:0%
gambling side so if we have a need
 
01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
there's positions available and funded
 
01:11:12.630 --> 01:11:12.640 align:start position:0%
uh we just don't fill them unless we
 
01:11:14.270 --> 01:11:14.280 align:start position:0%
need them uh we don't we just don't
 
01:11:17.110 --> 01:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:21.229 --> 01:11:21.239 align:start position:0%
way represent Elber thank you Mr chair
 
01:11:23.189 --> 01:11:23.199 align:start position:0%
one more quick question if I
 
01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
may are there any Casino operators who
 
01:11:29.310 --> 01:11:29.320 align:start position:0%
are hurting I I I assume this is a
 
01:11:32.189 --> 01:11:32.199 align:start position:0%
pretty lucrative business but even in
 
01:11:33.950 --> 01:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
lucrative businesses occasionally there
 
01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:36.719 align:start position:0%
are outliers who are not doing well are
 
01:11:40.390 --> 01:11:40.400 align:start position:0%
are any of ours here in that situation
 
01:11:43.430 --> 01:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
the seasonal ones are um trying to find
 
01:11:45.950 --> 01:11:45.960 align:start position:0%
their footing candidly uh Hampton Beach
 
01:11:48.669 --> 01:11:48.679 align:start position:0%
is just not crowded in February you know
 
01:11:49.830 --> 01:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
especially when it's negative five
 
01:11:53.590 --> 01:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
degrees with a windshield of some um so
 
01:11:56.110 --> 01:11:56.120 align:start position:0%
they're they're not
 
01:12:01.590 --> 01:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
very profitable but um the rest are are
 
01:12:05.390 --> 01:12:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:08.830 --> 01:12:08.840 align:start position:0%
you representative opal let's we've got
 
01:12:10.910 --> 01:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
other people one last quick question
 
01:12:13.350 --> 01:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
just so I understand um thank you Mr
 
01:12:17.149 --> 01:12:17.159 align:start position:0%
chair just and and thank you director um
 
01:12:18.950 --> 01:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
just so I understand I believe I
 
01:12:22.350 --> 01:12:22.360 align:start position:0%
understood you to say the switch from
 
01:12:24.270 --> 01:12:24.280 align:start position:0%
historic horse racing to the video
 
01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
terminals is a software issue not a
 
01:12:29.270 --> 01:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
hardware issue correct it's a con it's a
 
01:12:30.590 --> 01:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
Content issue and there's a cost
 
01:12:31.990 --> 01:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
associated with it I'm not going to
 
01:12:34.070 --> 01:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
downplay it it'll be you know three
 
01:12:37.229 --> 01:12:37.239 align:start position:0%
$4,000 per machine but the machine you
 
01:12:38.550 --> 01:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
would be very hard pressed to tell the
 
01:12:40.350 --> 01:12:40.360 align:start position:0%
difference between one to the
 
01:12:42.550 --> 01:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
other thank
 
01:12:45.910 --> 01:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
you thank you seeing no other questions
 
01:12:47.189 --> 01:12:47.199 align:start position:0%
thank you very much we're looking
 
01:12:50.629 --> 01:12:50.639 align:start position:0%
forward to that note of by five o'clock
 
01:12:50.639 --> 01:12:53.830 align:start position:0%
forward to that note of by five o'clock
today

01:12:53.830 --> 01:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:57.229 --> 01:12:57.239 align:start position:0%
tomorrow thank you thank
 
01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
you okay next up we or I guess the last
 
01:13:13.030 --> 01:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:15.270 --> 01:13:15.280 align:start position:0%
Horgan thank you very much thank you
 
01:13:17.110 --> 01:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
much Mr chair I hope I checked off the
 
01:13:18.870 --> 01:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
right box on my pink card I am in fact
 
01:13:20.430 --> 01:13:20.440 align:start position:0%
in favor of the bills there's so few
 
01:13:22.229 --> 01:13:22.239 align:start position:0%
bills that come around this year that I
 
01:13:24.750 --> 01:13:24.760 align:start position:0%
like but this one and anyway I'm
 
01:13:26.310 --> 01:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
resident Timothy Horan from straford
 
01:13:28.390 --> 01:13:28.400 align:start position:0%
County District 10 the town of Durham
 
01:13:30.750 --> 01:13:30.760 align:start position:0%
and we we don't have any historic horse
 
01:13:33.310 --> 01:13:33.320 align:start position:0%
racing facilities in our town although
 
01:13:36.149 --> 01:13:36.159 align:start position:0%
the next town over do does have a have a
 
01:13:37.830 --> 01:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
casino and Al I hardly ever go there I
 
01:13:39.790 --> 01:13:39.800 align:start position:0%
do have what of their what play like a
 
01:13:42.149 --> 01:13:42.159 align:start position:0%
rebel cars or what is they hand out so
 
01:13:44.030 --> 01:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
the I've just always felt like the
 
01:13:45.870 --> 01:13:45.880 align:start position:0%
historic horse racing machines really
 
01:13:47.950 --> 01:13:47.960 align:start position:0%
have nothing very much to do with horse
 
01:13:52.149 --> 01:13:52.159 align:start position:0%
racing they use uh a database of old
 
01:13:55.189 --> 01:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
horse race results as part of the random
 
01:13:57.669 --> 01:13:57.679 align:start position:0%
izing function for the slot machine and
 
01:13:59.270 --> 01:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
on the one hand that appeals to me cuz
 
01:14:02.750 --> 01:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
my uh mother was from Kentucky she my
 
01:14:05.590 --> 01:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
grandmother uh lived lived about a five
 
01:14:07.149 --> 01:14:07.159 align:start position:0%
mile five minute drive from Churchill
 
01:14:08.910 --> 01:14:08.920 align:start position:0%
down since she used to go over there so
 
01:14:12.669 --> 01:14:12.679 align:start position:0%
much as I like horse racing or at least
 
01:14:14.590 --> 01:14:14.600 align:start position:0%
at least part of me likes horse racing
 
01:14:17.510 --> 01:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
um these machines really have nothing
 
01:14:18.790 --> 01:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
particular to do with the horse racing
 
01:14:20.229 --> 01:14:20.239 align:start position:0%
industry except they were sort of
 
01:14:23.590 --> 01:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
invented as a means of uh keeping tracks
 
01:14:26.950 --> 01:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
in uh Kentucky and other horse racing
 
01:14:29.110 --> 01:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
States uh alive when people lost
 
01:14:31.350 --> 01:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
interest in in horse racing but in any
 
01:14:33.750 --> 01:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
case I don't think this is a good
 
01:14:36.229 --> 01:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
randomizing uh this isn't a good
 
01:14:37.910 --> 01:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
randomizing mechanism I think it it
 
01:14:40.830 --> 01:14:40.840 align:start position:0%
creates another uh another vulnerability
 
01:14:42.669 --> 01:14:42.679 align:start position:0%
for the computer systems that run the
 
01:14:45.750 --> 01:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
slot machines it's uh one more thing
 
01:14:49.149 --> 01:14:49.159 align:start position:0%
that a scammer either uh either an
 
01:14:51.470 --> 01:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
internal one you know inside the vendors
 
01:14:53.629 --> 01:14:53.639 align:start position:0%
or even with you know not art gaming
 
01:14:55.270 --> 01:14:55.280 align:start position:0%
commission but maybe some other state St
 
01:14:57.750 --> 01:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
gaming commission so it's one more it's
 
01:14:59.229 --> 01:14:59.239 align:start position:0%
one more Target it's one more
 
01:15:02.030 --> 01:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
vulnerability and it's um it's probably
 
01:15:03.790 --> 01:15:03.800 align:start position:0%
more expensive than simply operating a
 
01:15:06.270 --> 01:15:06.280 align:start position:0%
video Lottery tournament which is a pure
 
01:15:09.110 --> 01:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
uses a more secure randomizing function
 
01:15:11.390 --> 01:15:11.400 align:start position:0%
so I think from that that respect is
 
01:15:13.830 --> 01:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
unnecessary the change will be virtually
 
01:15:15.669 --> 01:15:15.679 align:start position:0%
invisible to the players the horse
 
01:15:18.590 --> 01:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
racing side of the historic horse racing
 
01:15:21.950 --> 01:15:21.960 align:start position:0%
things is hidden um if you do know the
 
01:15:24.350 --> 01:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
right buttons to press you can see like
 
01:15:26.510 --> 01:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
a little bit of the horse racing content
 
01:15:28.390 --> 01:15:28.400 align:start position:0%
but you know it's really uh probably my
 
01:15:29.950 --> 01:15:29.960 align:start position:0%
grandmother would probably be very bored
 
01:15:31.229 --> 01:15:31.239 align:start position:0%
with it even though she liked to play
 
01:15:33.310 --> 01:15:33.320 align:start position:0%
the horses because uh doesn't really
 
01:15:34.790 --> 01:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
give you enough information to make an
 
01:15:36.830 --> 01:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
intelligent guess about which horse is
 
01:15:40.030 --> 01:15:40.040 align:start position:0%
going to win um so I would just say uh
 
01:15:42.390 --> 01:15:42.400 align:start position:0%
the VTS there's some upfront cost but I
 
01:15:43.669 --> 01:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
think that's a much simpler more
 
01:15:45.669 --> 01:15:45.679 align:start position:0%
effective way I mean as for the larg of
 
01:15:46.910 --> 01:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
issue whether we should have slot
 
01:15:48.030 --> 01:15:48.040 align:start position:0%
machines here in New Hampshire and
 
01:15:49.990 --> 01:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
whether the charitable gaming model is
 
01:15:52.510 --> 01:15:52.520 align:start position:0%
the right way to go I have mixed
 
01:15:55.669 --> 01:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
feelings about it but it does uh
 
01:15:57.390 --> 01:15:57.400 align:start position:0%
some people do like it it does uh
 
01:15:58.990 --> 01:15:59.000 align:start position:0%
generate some revenue for the stage and
 
01:16:00.669 --> 01:16:00.679 align:start position:0%
for the Charities and uh it's one of the
 
01:16:03.709 --> 01:16:03.719 align:start position:0%
few Revenue sources that like uh we
 
01:16:04.950 --> 01:16:04.960 align:start position:0%
actually like having here in New
 
01:16:07.790 --> 01:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so from that respect they're
 
01:16:09.229 --> 01:16:09.239 align:start position:0%
fact of life so I would like them to be
 
01:16:11.910 --> 01:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
simpler less and more secure so I think
 
01:16:14.750 --> 01:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
to switch over to just a video Lottery
 
01:16:16.189 --> 01:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
tournament from the so-called historic
 
01:16:20.030 --> 01:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
horse racing is a positive step so that'
 
01:16:21.830 --> 01:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
be happy to take any oh there is also
 
01:16:23.830 --> 01:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
the issue of I will admit there is the
 
01:16:26.590 --> 01:16:26.600 align:start position:0%
issue of velocity of play so I I only
 
01:16:28.430 --> 01:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
heard the last witness and several other
 
01:16:30.750 --> 01:16:30.760 align:start position:0%
people put in pink cards but that's uh
 
01:16:32.229 --> 01:16:32.239 align:start position:0%
you know the feral Lottery termin can
 
01:16:33.990 --> 01:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
operate at virtually infinite speed
 
01:16:36.110 --> 01:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
whereas historic horse racing is kind of
 
01:16:37.990 --> 01:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
slow but there are regulatory ways you
 
01:16:39.870 --> 01:16:39.880 align:start position:0%
can do that even by simply you know
 
01:16:41.750 --> 01:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
throttling the number of requests you
 
01:16:43.590 --> 01:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
can make to the VT or there's probably
 
01:16:45.430 --> 01:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
other Solutions so I would just say uh
 
01:16:47.149 --> 01:16:47.159 align:start position:0%
so I support this bill and I apologize
 
01:16:48.510 --> 01:16:48.520 align:start position:0%
if I checked off the wrong box in the
 
01:16:50.390 --> 01:16:50.400 align:start position:0%
pink card so I'm happy to take any
 
01:16:52.270 --> 01:16:52.280 align:start position:0%
questions but you checked off the right
 
01:16:55.830 --> 01:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
box uh does anyone have any questions
 
01:16:59.590 --> 01:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
um yes R and ORS thank you Mr chairman
 
01:17:01.709 --> 01:17:01.719 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative Horgan did
 
01:17:04.310 --> 01:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
you say you actually lived in Kentucky
 
01:17:07.709 --> 01:17:07.719 align:start position:0%
no not me my uh my mother my mother's
 
01:17:10.350 --> 01:17:10.360 align:start position:0%
from my mother's from Louisville so my
 
01:17:12.990 --> 01:17:13.000 align:start position:0%
grandmother who's been dead since 1979
 
01:17:14.510 --> 01:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
she lived near Church Hill down since
 
01:17:15.470 --> 01:17:15.480 align:start position:0%
she used to like to go there
 
01:17:18.110 --> 01:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
occasionally um she had she would get
 
01:17:20.750 --> 01:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
the racing form she had a system it uh
 
01:17:22.070 --> 01:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
she was pretty smart it worked well
 
01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
enough for her to make make lunch she
 
01:17:25.629 --> 01:17:25.639 align:start position:0%
didn't she never took me and my mother
 
01:17:26.950 --> 01:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
along these outings that my mother
 
01:17:28.910 --> 01:17:28.920 align:start position:0%
didn't really approve of it and uh even
 
01:17:31.390 --> 01:17:31.400 align:start position:0%
for her I think the actual betting part
 
01:17:33.229 --> 01:17:33.239 align:start position:0%
of it was kind of boring is more a
 
01:17:34.430 --> 01:17:34.440 align:start position:0%
chance to just get out and have an
 
01:17:36.830 --> 01:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
outing and uh usually get a free lunch
 
01:17:39.310 --> 01:17:39.320 align:start position:0%
out of it so that was why she did it so
 
01:17:40.590 --> 01:17:40.600 align:start position:0%
well thank you I used to live in
 
01:17:42.550 --> 01:17:42.560 align:start position:0%
Kentucky or something about you oh we're
 
01:17:46.189 --> 01:17:46.199 align:start position:0%
in Kentucky um given given excuse me
 
01:17:48.070 --> 01:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
that's not a relevant question okay yeah
 
01:17:49.950 --> 01:17:49.960 align:start position:0%
sorry given that we're about 45 minutes
 
01:17:51.790 --> 01:17:51.800 align:start position:0%
behind schedule um we can talk about it
 
01:17:53.390 --> 01:17:53.400 align:start position:0%
offline is there any other specific
 
01:17:57.629 --> 01:17:57.639 align:start position:0%
question seeing thank you very
 
01:18:00.110 --> 01:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
much okay uh that's all I have for pin
 
01:18:01.590 --> 01:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
cards is there anyone else who'd like to
 
01:18:03.870 --> 01:18:03.880 align:start position:0%
testify on HB
 
01:18:06.229 --> 01:18:06.239 align:start position:0%
728 seeing none I'll close the public
 
01:18:11.510 --> 01:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:14.910 --> 01:18:14.920 align:start position:0%
728 that wasn't my
 
01:18:17.030 --> 01:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
goal we're going to take about a f
 
01:18:18.390 --> 01:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
minute break and we'll get started on
 
01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:18.270 --> 01:19:18.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:21.790 --> 01:19:21.800 align:start position:0%
oh should just call me c
 
01:19:26.070 --> 01:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
ready I don't mind driving The Rock
 
01:19:31.669 --> 01:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:33.870 --> 01:19:33.880 align:start position:0%
yeah to
 
01:19:38.229 --> 01:19:38.239 align:start position:0%
rep I don't think so because it's under
 
01:19:41.189 --> 01:19:41.199 align:start position:0%
50 because it's only our I mean unless
 
01:19:43.709 --> 01:19:43.719 align:start position:0%

e

01:27:53.109 --> 01:27:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:53.119 --> 01:28:23.109 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:28:23.109 --> 01:28:23.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:23.119 --> 01:28:53.030 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:28:53.030 --> 01:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:53.040 --> 01:29:23.030 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:29:23.030 --> 01:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:53.030 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:29:53.030 --> 01:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:31.229 --> 01:30:31.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:40.990 --> 01:30:41.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:44.070 --> 01:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
737 that's right yeah so the last last
 
01:30:47.669 --> 01:30:47.679 align:start position:0%
exec session on this um
 
01:30:51.870 --> 01:30:51.880 align:start position:0%
was an it we had a motion of itl and it
 
01:30:54.950 --> 01:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
had been seconded um but since then we
 
01:30:59.149 --> 01:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
have a an amendment here and um and we
 
01:31:02.109 --> 01:31:02.119 align:start position:0%
also have a better understanding of um
 
01:31:04.470 --> 01:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
the bill I believe because we are that
 
01:31:07.390 --> 01:31:07.400 align:start position:0%
itl motion was primarily put forth
 
01:31:08.790 --> 01:31:08.800 align:start position:0%
because we were saying it was the same
 
01:31:14.790 --> 01:31:14.800 align:start position:0%
as HB 247 which it is not um and so I
 
01:31:16.430 --> 01:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
think at this point I think the first
 
01:31:19.109 --> 01:31:19.119 align:start position:0%
step might be to unwind this and and
 
01:31:23.189 --> 01:31:23.199 align:start position:0%
come back to um where we should be I
 
01:31:26.870 --> 01:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:32.550 --> 01:31:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:35.430 --> 01:31:35.440 align:start position:0%
I representative ducett is not here to
 
01:31:39.070 --> 01:31:39.080 align:start position:0%
take back his motion so I'm not sure how
 
01:31:41.030 --> 01:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
um represent Al do you know how that
 
01:31:54.229 --> 01:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:59.470 --> 01:31:59.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:04.070 --> 01:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
know I would think the situation uh uh
 
01:32:06.950 --> 01:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
parliamentary wise would be that the
 
01:32:08.669 --> 01:32:08.679 align:start position:0%
motion's been made the motion's been
 
01:32:10.950 --> 01:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
seconded the primary maker cannot
 
01:32:14.470 --> 01:32:14.480 align:start position:0%
withdraw but the secondary maker can
 
01:32:18.229 --> 01:32:18.239 align:start position:0%
withdraw uh the seconder if he
 
01:32:21.430 --> 01:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
withdraws second representative Murphy
 
01:32:22.910 --> 01:32:22.920 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy you you had
 
01:32:25.189 --> 01:32:25.199 align:start position:0%
seconded the bill so if you withdraw
 
01:32:26.669 --> 01:32:26.679 align:start position:0%
your second
 
01:32:31.870 --> 01:32:31.880 align:start position:0%
then okay I withdraw my second on uh HB
 
01:32:36.070 --> 01:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
um 737 FN thank you okay okay there
 
01:32:37.669 --> 01:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
therefore there is no second now there
 
01:32:40.350 --> 01:32:40.360 align:start position:0%
being no second on that itl motion that
 
01:32:42.629 --> 01:32:42.639 align:start position:0%
motion uh will not move
 
01:32:46.430 --> 01:32:46.440 align:start position:0%
forward okay I have
 
01:32:50.629 --> 01:32:50.639 align:start position:0%
um put so first let me let me say so uh
 
01:32:53.310 --> 01:32:53.320 align:start position:0%
in taking a closer look at these bills
 
01:32:57.229 --> 01:32:57.239 align:start position:0%
over the week weekend uh 247 while they
 
01:32:59.430 --> 01:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
seemed very similar
 
01:32:59.440 --> 01:33:01.590 align:start position:0%
seemed very similar
247

01:33:01.590 --> 01:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
247
 
01:33:06.550 --> 01:33:06.560 align:start position:0%
um was a a bill that dealt with
 
01:33:06.560 --> 01:33:08.750 align:start position:0%
um was a a bill that dealt with
HHR

01:33:08.750 --> 01:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
HHR
 
01:33:12.189 --> 01:33:12.199 align:start position:0%
um only and this bill while it seemed
 
01:33:15.070 --> 01:33:15.080 align:start position:0%
the same U deals with charitable gaming
 
01:33:16.550 --> 01:33:16.560 align:start position:0%
of which
 
01:33:20.550 --> 01:33:20.560 align:start position:0%
HHR uh could be a component thereof uh
 
01:33:23.109 --> 01:33:23.119 align:start position:0%
so so this is different this does uh
 
01:33:24.709 --> 01:33:24.719 align:start position:0%
this should not be killed just because
 
01:33:26.910 --> 01:33:26.920 align:start position:0%
it's quote the same because it isn't the
 
01:33:31.149 --> 01:33:31.159 align:start position:0%
same um so anyways I have a an amendment
 
01:33:43.590 --> 01:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:51.910 align:start position:0%
 
2025-the

01:33:51.910 --> 01:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:57.310 --> 01:33:57.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:00.350 --> 01:34:00.360 align:start position:0%
the operator who ceases operation for so
 
01:34:01.790 --> 01:34:01.800 align:start position:0%
basically if an operator ceases
 
01:34:01.800 --> 01:34:03.669 align:start position:0%
basically if an operator ceases
operation

01:34:03.669 --> 01:34:03.679 align:start position:0%
operation
 
01:34:06.629 --> 01:34:06.639 align:start position:0%
for a period exceeding two years then
 
01:34:08.470 --> 01:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
the town could take a new vote on
 
01:34:10.990 --> 01:34:11.000 align:start position:0%
whether to allow
 
01:34:14.990 --> 01:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
uh gaming or not the amendment increases
 
01:34:17.950 --> 01:34:17.960 align:start position:0%
the two years to four years uh and it
 
01:34:17.960 --> 01:34:19.030 align:start position:0%
the two years to four years uh and it
also

01:34:19.030 --> 01:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:34:21.270 --> 01:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
increases there was a period of five
 
01:34:24.109 --> 01:34:24.119 align:start position:0%
years after a new application's been uh
 
01:34:26.109 --> 01:34:26.119 align:start position:0%
approved that was five years this
 
01:34:28.470 --> 01:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
increases it to 10 years the reasoning
 
01:34:31.109 --> 01:34:31.119 align:start position:0%
Behind These increases are that there's
 
01:34:33.669 --> 01:34:33.679 align:start position:0%
various uh situations that can happen
 
01:34:36.590 --> 01:34:36.600 align:start position:0%
where an operator uh may need more
 
01:34:39.229 --> 01:34:39.239 align:start position:0%
time uh to make to make sure that these
 
01:34:40.990 --> 01:34:41.000 align:start position:0%
things happen and what it does it
 
01:34:42.990 --> 01:34:43.000 align:start position:0%
prevents the town after voting a certain
 
01:34:45.270 --> 01:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
way preventing the to giving the the
 
01:34:47.109 --> 01:34:47.119 align:start position:0%
operator more time before the town can
 
01:34:49.470 --> 01:34:49.480 align:start position:0%
come in and say oh we changed our mind
 
01:34:50.910 --> 01:34:50.920 align:start position:0%
and as you can imagine there's a lot of
 
01:34:54.149 --> 01:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
investment that goes into uh these these
 
01:34:55.950 --> 01:34:55.960 align:start position:0%
things and so we want to make sure the
 
01:34:58.790 --> 01:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
operators have enough time to
 
01:35:03.070 --> 01:35:03.080 align:start position:0%
um to to follow up and and before a town
 
01:35:04.830 --> 01:35:04.840 align:start position:0%
could take a vote reversing things
 
01:35:07.669 --> 01:35:07.679 align:start position:0%
representative opal um thank you Mr
 
01:35:10.310 --> 01:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
chairman uh
 
01:35:12.830 --> 01:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
I first of all as I read the original
 
01:35:16.229 --> 01:35:16.239 align:start position:0%
unless it's changed um it says ceasing
 
01:35:18.950 --> 01:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
operations for a period of two years or
 
01:35:21.030 --> 01:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
failing to commence operation within
 
01:35:25.350 --> 01:35:25.360 align:start position:0%
four years not five as I'm reading okay
 
01:35:27.590 --> 01:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
I may have misspoke on the on that I I
 
01:35:30.870 --> 01:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
will just say that it it seems to
 
01:35:35.149 --> 01:35:35.159 align:start position:0%
me um 31 if you've got an application
 
01:35:37.629 --> 01:35:37.639 align:start position:0%
and you haven't moved on it in 10 years
 
01:35:39.750 --> 01:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
that that seems like an exceedingly long
 
01:35:44.109 --> 01:35:44.119 align:start position:0%
period of time to me and I just you know
 
01:35:44.119 --> 01:35:45.070 align:start position:0%
period of time to me and I just you know
I

01:35:45.070 --> 01:35:45.080 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:35:48.830 --> 01:35:48.840 align:start position:0%
I I I think I think as the original bill
 
01:35:52.350 --> 01:35:52.360 align:start position:0%
says uh if you cease operations for two
 
01:35:55.390 --> 01:35:55.400 align:start position:0%
years um
 
01:35:56.990 --> 01:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
you're sort of sending a message but
 
01:35:59.310 --> 01:35:59.320 align:start position:0%
certainly if you fail to move within
 
01:36:01.030 --> 01:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
four years I think that's a reasonable
 
01:36:03.270 --> 01:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
period of time I I'll just say I mean I
 
01:36:04.709 --> 01:36:04.719 align:start position:0%
I understand the notion of your
 
01:36:08.270 --> 01:36:08.280 align:start position:0%
Amendment and and maybe there's
 
01:36:08.280 --> 01:36:09.950 align:start position:0%
Amendment and and maybe there's
some

01:36:09.950 --> 01:36:09.960 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:36:12.070 --> 01:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
some time in
 
01:36:15.910 --> 01:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
between 4 and 10 but 10 seems like you
 
01:36:18.229 --> 01:36:18.239 align:start position:0%
know what what are you doing for 10
 
01:36:20.709 --> 01:36:20.719 align:start position:0%
years not moving on an application that
 
01:36:22.629 --> 01:36:22.639 align:start position:0%
that just seems like you're putting the
 
01:36:25.709 --> 01:36:25.719 align:start position:0%
community you a in a very very tough
 
01:36:27.550 --> 01:36:27.560 align:start position:0%
situation that they can't do anything
 
01:36:31.350 --> 01:36:31.360 align:start position:0%
for 10 years well let's keep in mind a
 
01:36:33.910 --> 01:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
um when it's approved when the community
 
01:36:35.990 --> 01:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
has approved it hopefully they've
 
01:36:38.390 --> 01:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
they've done their due diligence on it
 
01:36:41.070 --> 01:36:41.080 align:start position:0%
but these these operators depending on
 
01:36:42.229 --> 01:36:42.239 align:start position:0%
the size of the facility they're
 
01:36:44.550 --> 01:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
building and how many approvals they get
 
01:36:46.470 --> 01:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes these things can take a lot of
 
01:36:48.550 --> 01:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
time now whether tends the right or it
 
01:36:51.229 --> 01:36:51.239 align:start position:0%
should be something else um the the
 
01:36:53.070 --> 01:36:53.080 align:start position:0%
worst thing would be for an operator to
 
01:36:55.750 --> 01:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
get caught up in the idea of four years
 
01:36:58.270 --> 01:36:58.280 align:start position:0%
ran out they've invested you know
 
01:36:59.950 --> 01:36:59.960 align:start position:0%
potentially millions of dollars town
 
01:37:02.270 --> 01:37:02.280 align:start position:0%
bootes to reverse I first of all I guess
 
01:37:03.950 --> 01:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
the question would be what are the odds
 
01:37:05.830 --> 01:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
that a Town's going to reverse
 
01:37:08.629 --> 01:37:08.639 align:start position:0%
themselves but if they did then we just
 
01:37:09.910 --> 01:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that people have
 
01:37:12.310 --> 01:37:12.320 align:start position:0%
enough time after making all this
 
01:37:16.629 --> 01:37:16.639 align:start position:0%
investment not to be you know and and Mr
 
01:37:18.350 --> 01:37:18.360 align:start position:0%
chairman I I understand that I mean you
 
01:37:21.109 --> 01:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
know if if if if the town has given its
 
01:37:24.510 --> 01:37:24.520 align:start position:0%
permission or or has not not acted I
 
01:37:26.189 --> 01:37:26.199 align:start position:0%
mean if the town hasn't hasn't
 
01:37:28.350 --> 01:37:28.360 align:start position:0%
affirmatively said
 
01:37:32.310 --> 01:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
no um and and someone an investor comes
 
01:37:35.070 --> 01:37:35.080 align:start position:0%
along and and begins that
 
01:37:37.510 --> 01:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
process I I I understand there there
 
01:37:39.910 --> 01:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
should be a time period that the town
 
01:37:42.669 --> 01:37:42.679 align:start position:0%
can't then turn around and say y too
 
01:37:45.950 --> 01:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
late but 10 years seems exceedingly long
 
01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:46.870 align:start position:0%
late but 10 years seems exceedingly long
to

01:37:46.870 --> 01:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:37:49.830 --> 01:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
me represent boards thank you Mr
 
01:37:53.189 --> 01:37:53.199 align:start position:0%
chairman so uh I understand the comments
 
01:37:56.430 --> 01:37:56.440 align:start position:0%
being made by my colleague here uh and
 
01:37:59.990 --> 01:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
to me that would seem uh within reason
 
01:38:03.310 --> 01:38:03.320 align:start position:0%
what he's saying however my experience
 
01:38:06.310 --> 01:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
is different in that my son purchased
 
01:38:07.830 --> 01:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
the ski
 
01:38:10.950 --> 01:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
lodge and here in New England and it's
 
01:38:13.510 --> 01:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
been five years just to get through the
 
01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:14.709 align:start position:0%
been five years just to get through the
permitting

01:38:14.709 --> 01:38:14.719 align:start position:0%
permitting
 
01:38:17.669 --> 01:38:17.679 align:start position:0%
process and so I would have thought that
 
01:38:21.430 --> 01:38:21.440 align:start position:0%
4 and 10 would be crazy and unnecessary
 
01:38:23.830 --> 01:38:23.840 align:start position:0%
but in today's world just getting a
 
01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:25.189 align:start position:0%
but in today's world just getting a
permitting

01:38:25.189 --> 01:38:25.199 align:start position:0%
permitting
 
01:38:28.430 --> 01:38:28.440 align:start position:0%
process is it takes a lifetime and he
 
01:38:31.950 --> 01:38:31.960 align:start position:0%
has invested well over a million doll
 
01:38:34.950 --> 01:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
now and has had to file a lawsuit
 
01:38:37.189 --> 01:38:37.199 align:start position:0%
against the state to recover some of his
 
01:38:40.070 --> 01:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
funds due to their lack of uh due
 
01:38:42.390 --> 01:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
diligence and negligence so I would
 
01:38:44.870 --> 01:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
think the timing is just
 
01:38:48.550 --> 01:38:48.560 align:start position:0%
fine okay I just um I'll take more more
 
01:38:50.589 --> 01:38:50.599 align:start position:0%
in a moment but I just realized we we
 
01:38:52.430 --> 01:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
need a motion to be this is an exact
 
01:38:54.109 --> 01:38:54.119 align:start position:0%
session not a work session
 
01:38:56.470 --> 01:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
um we Unwound the itl which is which is
 
01:38:58.430 --> 01:38:58.440 align:start position:0%
fine I'm going to recognize
 
01:39:00.070 --> 01:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
representative Yul for a
 
01:39:03.109 --> 01:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
motion I move ought to pass and would
 
01:39:05.790 --> 01:39:05.800 align:start position:0%
like to be recognized for an amendment
 
01:39:09.270 --> 01:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
do I have a second second
 
01:39:11.350 --> 01:39:11.360 align:start position:0%
by so we're talking about the initial
 
01:39:13.070 --> 01:39:13.080 align:start position:0%
bill right now does somebody want to
 
01:39:17.470 --> 01:39:17.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:20.589 --> 01:39:20.599 align:start position:0%
okay Susan did you want to Second it
 
01:39:27.910 --> 01:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:29.990 --> 01:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
Murphy recognize
 
01:39:32.109 --> 01:39:32.119 align:start position:0%
representative and I would offer
 
01:39:36.790 --> 01:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
amendment to uh unapproved Amendment um
 
01:39:38.350 --> 01:39:38.360 align:start position:0%
I got to learn how to use these damn
 
01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:40.709 align:start position:0%
I got to learn how to use these damn
glasses

01:39:40.709 --> 01:39:40.719 align:start position:0%
glasses
 
01:39:43.070 --> 01:39:43.080 align:start position:0%
28418 yeah that
 
01:39:48.709 --> 01:39:48.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:52.990 --> 01:39:53.000 align:start position:0%
8418 and I'd like to speak okay and I'll
 
01:39:55.030 --> 01:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
second well we need a second I'll second
 
01:39:57.510 --> 01:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
that motion so he can speak
 
01:40:00.709 --> 01:40:00.719 align:start position:0%
okay shamber seconds the that's nice
 
01:40:04.750 --> 01:40:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:04.760 --> 01:40:07.550 align:start position:0%
 
speak

01:40:07.550 --> 01:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
speak
 
01:40:10.629 --> 01:40:10.639 align:start position:0%
um the time period on this seems to be
 
01:40:12.709 --> 01:40:12.719 align:start position:0%
appropriate as uh representative ORS
 
01:40:15.109 --> 01:40:15.119 align:start position:0%
previously commented sometimes things
 
01:40:17.430 --> 01:40:17.440 align:start position:0%
can take a long time I know sitting on
 
01:40:19.510 --> 01:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
the planning board in Hudson we've had a
 
01:40:22.149 --> 01:40:22.159 align:start position:0%
couple of large developments in Hudson
 
01:40:24.310 --> 01:40:24.320 align:start position:0%
and those things had been going on for
 
01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:25.350 align:start position:0%
and those things had been going on for
several

01:40:25.350 --> 01:40:25.360 align:start position:0%
several
 
01:40:28.830 --> 01:40:28.840 align:start position:0%
years just to get the money in place
 
01:40:31.550 --> 01:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
just to get the Hampton notes available
 
01:40:34.629 --> 01:40:34.639 align:start position:0%
and in the meantime the developers spent
 
01:40:38.030 --> 01:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
literally in Hudson millions of
 
01:40:40.709 --> 01:40:40.719 align:start position:0%
dollars it can be very
 
01:40:43.830 --> 01:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
expensive uh regarding representative
 
01:40:46.830 --> 01:40:46.840 align:start position:0%
opal's period also if you take a look at
 
01:40:49.470 --> 01:40:49.480 align:start position:0%
your planning board situations most of
 
01:40:52.629 --> 01:40:52.639 align:start position:0%
their uh time limits that they have have
 
01:40:56.510 --> 01:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
an un limited number of
 
01:40:59.510 --> 01:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
continuations that can take place so
 
01:41:02.030 --> 01:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
rather than have the the town keep
 
01:41:04.950 --> 01:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
coming up and no we no we'll defer no
 
01:41:06.589 --> 01:41:06.599 align:start position:0%
we'll defer every year while they're
 
01:41:09.470 --> 01:41:09.480 align:start position:0%
getting the monies in place set a time C
 
01:41:12.430 --> 01:41:12.440 align:start position:0%
you got four years you got 10 years you
 
01:41:14.030 --> 01:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
should ought to be able to put it
 
01:41:17.189 --> 01:41:17.199 align:start position:0%
together by that time thank
 
01:41:20.830 --> 01:41:20.840 align:start position:0%
you represent uh
 
01:41:24.470 --> 01:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
elberger thank you Mr chair I wonder
 
01:41:27.070 --> 01:41:27.080 align:start position:0%
if they're two separate pieces there's
 
01:41:29.310 --> 01:41:29.320 align:start position:0%
the application approval and then the
 
01:41:32.229 --> 01:41:32.239 align:start position:0%
permitting correct they're actually two
 
01:41:36.990 --> 01:41:37.000 align:start position:0%
pieces and I wonder if adding changing
 
01:41:39.310 --> 01:41:39.320 align:start position:0%
the time of the
 
01:41:42.149 --> 01:41:42.159 align:start position:0%
application uh approval because I I
 
01:41:42.159 --> 01:41:43.589 align:start position:0%
application uh approval because I I
would

01:41:43.589 --> 01:41:43.599 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:41:46.350 --> 01:41:46.360 align:start position:0%
support uh the notion that that is too
 
01:41:49.229 --> 01:41:49.239 align:start position:0%
long and maybe say something along the
 
01:41:49.239 --> 01:41:50.550 align:start position:0%
long and maybe say something along the
lines

01:41:50.550 --> 01:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
lines
 
01:41:53.550 --> 01:41:53.560 align:start position:0%
of um
 
01:41:54.990 --> 01:41:55.000 align:start position:0%
however however many years following
 
01:41:56.950 --> 01:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
application approval and a certain
 
01:41:58.950 --> 01:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
number of years for the permitting
 
01:42:01.950 --> 01:42:01.960 align:start position:0%
process which hopefully would put some
 
01:42:03.790 --> 01:42:03.800 align:start position:0%
of the responsibility for potential
 
01:42:06.270 --> 01:42:06.280 align:start position:0%
delays back on the
 
01:42:08.589 --> 01:42:08.599 align:start position:0%
locality rather than saying well it's
 
01:42:11.070 --> 01:42:11.080 align:start position:0%
it's the developers or The Operators
 
01:42:12.910 --> 01:42:12.920 align:start position:0%
problem because they didn't take care of
 
01:42:15.830 --> 01:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
it and saying to a locality if it has
 
01:42:19.109 --> 01:42:19.119 align:start position:0%
been approved you have to get it done in
 
01:42:21.950 --> 01:42:21.960 align:start position:0%
a certain amount of time which yes is
 
01:42:24.030 --> 01:42:24.040 align:start position:0%
taking away some local
 
01:42:26.750 --> 01:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
control but I wonder if it if there's a
 
01:42:30.990 --> 01:42:31.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:33.589 --> 01:42:33.599 align:start position:0%
pieces I don't know it yeah I don't know
 
01:42:35.109 --> 01:42:35.119 align:start position:0%
I think I would keep it one piece but
 
01:42:37.709 --> 01:42:37.719 align:start position:0%
this already is telling the locality
 
01:42:41.390 --> 01:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
that you can't change your mind for 10
 
01:42:44.189 --> 01:42:44.199 align:start position:0%
years on a new application uh because
 
01:42:45.669 --> 01:42:45.679 align:start position:0%
there is I I think a lot of times we
 
01:42:48.669 --> 01:42:48.679 align:start position:0%
just think okay locality approved it now
 
01:42:50.310 --> 01:42:50.320 align:start position:0%
they can start you know the building
 
01:42:53.589 --> 01:42:53.599 align:start position:0%
process but uh there there is a you know
 
01:42:56.070 --> 01:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
representative or's Point uh and what
 
01:42:58.229 --> 01:42:58.239 align:start position:0%
representative UL has seen on his board
 
01:42:59.870 --> 01:42:59.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of times these guys spend years
 
01:43:02.109 --> 01:43:02.119 align:start position:0%
just getting all the financing together
 
01:43:04.629 --> 01:43:04.639 align:start position:0%
and so that's and then they then they
 
01:43:05.910 --> 01:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
have to go through the permitting
 
01:43:07.790 --> 01:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
process and then they have to build it I
 
01:43:09.709 --> 01:43:09.719 align:start position:0%
think so it does seem like a really long
 
01:43:12.430 --> 01:43:12.440 align:start position:0%
time but it's it's it's amazing how the
 
01:43:15.030 --> 01:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
time does get get eaten up and and so
 
01:43:17.830 --> 01:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
the the town B this bill is basically
 
01:43:20.350 --> 01:43:20.360 align:start position:0%
giving towns the option to allow or not
 
01:43:22.550 --> 01:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
allow well I don't know the def the
 
01:43:22.560 --> 01:43:23.990 align:start position:0%
allow well I don't know the def the
default

01:43:23.990 --> 01:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
default
 
01:43:26.870 --> 01:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
I think is what I think the default is
 
01:43:31.430 --> 01:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
allow but a town can opt out of this um
 
01:43:34.470 --> 01:43:34.480 align:start position:0%
and then they just can't uh change their
 
01:43:39.430 --> 01:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
mind for 10 years yeah rivers and
 
01:43:41.669 --> 01:43:41.679 align:start position:0%
open yeah I have a question on the
 
01:43:44.950 --> 01:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
wording of the uh section Roman numeral
 
01:43:47.709 --> 01:43:47.719 align:start position:0%
8 and whether that is consistent with
 
01:43:49.709 --> 01:43:49.719 align:start position:0%
the intent that we
 
01:43:52.589 --> 01:43:52.599 align:start position:0%
described uh the way I read Section 8 if
 
01:43:54.669 --> 01:43:54.679 align:start position:0%
and be looking for a legal
 
01:43:57.629 --> 01:43:57.639 align:start position:0%
interpretation of this that says that
 
01:43:59.750 --> 01:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
the Min May prohibit
 
01:44:04.109 --> 01:44:04.119 align:start position:0%
games but this shall not
 
01:44:08.149 --> 01:44:08.159 align:start position:0%
apply to any games of chance licensed by
 
01:44:09.629 --> 01:44:09.639 align:start position:0%
The Lottery
 
01:44:12.350 --> 01:44:12.360 align:start position:0%
Commission so I read that as saying well
 
01:44:14.390 --> 01:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
the town may not like the game if the
 
01:44:15.910 --> 01:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
Lottery Commission has approved this
 
01:44:17.950 --> 01:44:17.960 align:start position:0%
game the town doesn't have the right to
 
01:44:24.550 --> 01:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:28.510 --> 01:44:28.520 align:start position:0%
repr you what did you
 
01:44:31.750 --> 01:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
I yeah I think missing on line 13 in
 
01:44:34.030 --> 01:44:34.040 align:start position:0%
between the word
 
01:44:37.109 --> 01:44:37.119 align:start position:0%
um uh operator and licensed is would be
 
01:44:38.510 --> 01:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
the word
 
01:44:40.950 --> 01:44:40.960 align:start position:0%
currently or any applicant who has
 
01:44:43.550 --> 01:44:43.560 align:start position:0%
applied because that would make the the
 
01:44:46.070 --> 01:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
first half of that phrase or that
 
01:44:48.070 --> 01:44:48.080 align:start position:0%
sentence phrase the
 
01:44:51.030 --> 01:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
phrase uh comply comport with the second
 
01:44:53.709 --> 01:44:53.719 align:start position:0%
half which is an application
 
01:44:57.189 --> 01:44:57.199 align:start position:0%
in existence as a and this would then
 
01:45:01.350 --> 01:45:01.360 align:start position:0%
say current operator currently licensed
 
01:45:03.070 --> 01:45:03.080 align:start position:0%
prior to this so that somebody was
 
01:45:05.470 --> 01:45:05.480 align:start position:0%
already in operation you couldn't have a
 
01:45:07.390 --> 01:45:07.400 align:start position:0%
vote to get rid of them and take them
 
01:45:09.229 --> 01:45:09.239 align:start position:0%
out well I think yeah I see what you're
 
01:45:10.950 --> 01:45:10.960 align:start position:0%
saying but I think if an operator is
 
01:45:12.910 --> 01:45:12.920 align:start position:0%
licensed they're they're currently
 
01:45:16.750 --> 01:45:16.760 align:start position:0%
licensed um so I think I think uh I did
 
01:45:19.589 --> 01:45:19.599 align:start position:0%
that would also be the the other way I'm
 
01:45:22.310 --> 01:45:22.320 align:start position:0%
just just trying to follow up on what
 
01:45:24.709 --> 01:45:24.719 align:start position:0%
represen will say okay does that make
 
01:45:26.270 --> 01:45:26.280 align:start position:0%
sense represent so basically what it's
 
01:45:29.109 --> 01:45:29.119 align:start position:0%
saying is if you're already operating
 
01:45:31.709 --> 01:45:31.719 align:start position:0%
they the town can't decide you no longer
 
01:45:34.830 --> 01:45:34.840 align:start position:0%
can operate or if you if you are in the
 
01:45:34.840 --> 01:45:36.030 align:start position:0%
can operate or if you if you are in the
queue

01:45:36.030 --> 01:45:36.040 align:start position:0%
queue
 
01:45:38.430 --> 01:45:38.440 align:start position:0%
basically the applicant's been approved
 
01:45:41.870 --> 01:45:41.880 align:start position:0%
follow up on that the the past tense and
 
01:45:45.709 --> 01:45:45.719 align:start position:0%
licensed which exists a license in place
 
01:45:48.229 --> 01:45:48.239 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I I guess I'd feel better with
 
01:45:50.189 --> 01:45:50.199 align:start position:0%
a interpretation of this a legal
 
01:45:52.430 --> 01:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
interpretation and the realize the basis
 
01:45:54.870 --> 01:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
for my question is what's happened with
 
01:45:57.229 --> 01:45:57.239 align:start position:0%
historic horse racing when we had a
 
01:45:58.830 --> 01:45:58.840 align:start position:0%
Prohibition that the license cannot be
 
01:46:01.510 --> 01:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
transferred or sold and indeed there was
 
01:46:03.870 --> 01:46:03.880 align:start position:0%
a legal wrangling over that where the
 
01:46:05.750 --> 01:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
license was transferred or sold by the
 
01:46:07.870 --> 01:46:07.880 align:start position:0%
sale of the business so I'm very
 
01:46:10.149 --> 01:46:10.159 align:start position:0%
sensitive to the specifics of the
 
01:46:12.030 --> 01:46:12.040 align:start position:0%
wording in here and I want to make sure
 
01:46:13.910 --> 01:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
that there's no
 
01:46:16.550 --> 01:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
preemption by the city and towns
 
01:46:18.790 --> 01:46:18.800 align:start position:0%
correction there's no preemption by the
 
01:46:21.390 --> 01:46:21.400 align:start position:0%
lottery that the city and town must take
 
01:46:23.709 --> 01:46:23.719 align:start position:0%
this game even though the town did not
 
01:46:23.719 --> 01:46:25.430 align:start position:0%
this game even though the town did not
want

01:46:25.430 --> 01:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
want
 
01:46:28.030 --> 01:46:28.040 align:start position:0%
it and the way I read this language is
 
01:46:29.910 --> 01:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
that if this is a game that's approved
 
01:46:32.310 --> 01:46:32.320 align:start position:0%
by the lottery the town must take it
 
01:46:35.070 --> 01:46:35.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the option to opt
 
01:46:37.510 --> 01:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
out well that yeah that would make sense
 
01:46:40.589 --> 01:46:40.599 align:start position:0%
they're already operating Mr chairman
 
01:46:43.550 --> 01:46:43.560 align:start position:0%
yes represent elberger thank you
 
01:46:46.950 --> 01:46:46.960 align:start position:0%
I if some if a an operator is licensed
 
01:46:48.990 --> 01:46:49.000 align:start position:0%
by The Lottery Commission and is
 
01:46:51.750 --> 01:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
operating in another community that
 
01:46:54.750 --> 01:46:54.760 align:start position:0%
person is still licensed
 
01:46:58.709 --> 01:46:58.719 align:start position:0%
correct the license isn't limited to it
 
01:47:00.870 --> 01:47:00.880 align:start position:0%
is all right so that limited to the
 
01:47:03.830 --> 01:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
community to that Community yes all
 
01:47:08.310 --> 01:47:08.320 align:start position:0%
right I I'm finding that
 
01:47:11.870 --> 01:47:11.880 align:start position:0%
this this wording is confusing enough to
 
01:47:14.070 --> 01:47:14.080 align:start position:0%
enough of us I think that I think it
 
01:47:17.430 --> 01:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
might make sense to defer voting on this
 
01:47:21.430 --> 01:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:27.470 --> 01:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
up represent op um I I will just say
 
01:47:27.480 --> 01:47:29.669 align:start position:0%
up represent op um I I will just say
again

01:47:29.669 --> 01:47:29.679 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:47:32.629 --> 01:47:32.639 align:start position:0%
um this is unlikely to
 
01:47:35.390 --> 01:47:35.400 align:start position:0%
happen but under this
 
01:47:37.990 --> 01:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
provision I could file a
 
01:47:40.669 --> 01:47:40.679 align:start position:0%
license uh in every community in the
 
01:47:43.270 --> 01:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
state and preclude every community in
 
01:47:45.189 --> 01:47:45.199 align:start position:0%
the state from having the opportunity to
 
01:47:47.950 --> 01:47:47.960 align:start position:0%
vote on whether they want a casino or
 
01:47:52.589 --> 01:47:52.599 align:start position:0%
not um because this says if if you if
 
01:47:55.109 --> 01:47:55.119 align:start position:0%
you filed a license and then you have 10
 
01:47:59.030 --> 01:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
years to act on that license um which if
 
01:48:01.350 --> 01:48:01.360 align:start position:0%
you if you don't have at least some
 
01:48:03.430 --> 01:48:03.440 align:start position:0%
beginning I understand there are delays
 
01:48:06.270 --> 01:48:06.280 align:start position:0%
and and maybe four years isn't long
 
01:48:08.910 --> 01:48:08.920 align:start position:0%
enough but it seems to me we are hand
 
01:48:12.310 --> 01:48:12.320 align:start position:0%
capping a town or a municipality for 10
 
01:48:14.629 --> 01:48:14.639 align:start position:0%
years um if you haven't gotten your
 
01:48:16.149 --> 01:48:16.159 align:start position:0%
financing together if you haven't gotten
 
01:48:18.070 --> 01:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
your plans together if you can't
 
01:48:18.080 --> 01:48:19.189 align:start position:0%
your plans together if you can't
commence

01:48:19.189 --> 01:48:19.199 align:start position:0%
commence
 
01:48:19.199 --> 01:48:20.830 align:start position:0%
commence
operations

01:48:20.830 --> 01:48:20.840 align:start position:0%
operations
 
01:48:23.270 --> 01:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
and you know um
 
01:48:25.910 --> 01:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
maybe I could even see changing the
 
01:48:28.990 --> 01:48:29.000 align:start position:0%
commence operations to perhaps to some
 
01:48:32.510 --> 01:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
other to some other Milestone but I I
 
01:48:35.270 --> 01:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
just I have a real problem I can't I
 
01:48:37.870 --> 01:48:37.880 align:start position:0%
can't support 10 years and and allowing
 
01:48:41.270 --> 01:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
a a community be tied up for for a
 
01:48:44.030 --> 01:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
decade that just seems
 
01:48:48.149 --> 01:48:48.159 align:start position:0%
um too long to me
 
01:48:50.589 --> 01:48:50.599 align:start position:0%
represent take a look at the
 
01:48:53.229 --> 01:48:53.239 align:start position:0%
process no one is going to give be any
 
01:48:54.629 --> 01:48:54.639 align:start position:0%
financing if you don't have the
 
01:48:58.350 --> 01:48:58.360 align:start position:0%
permission of the town so the very first
 
01:49:01.510 --> 01:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
step is to get the permission of the
 
01:49:05.510 --> 01:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
Town once that has taken place all of
 
01:49:07.510 --> 01:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
the other stuff can take
 
01:49:10.030 --> 01:49:10.040 align:start position:0%
place let's say you're going to build a
 
01:49:14.350 --> 01:49:14.360 align:start position:0%
facility like the Nash it took them I
 
01:49:17.030 --> 01:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
would I'm saying around five years to
 
01:49:24.390 --> 01:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
get that redo the Sears and modify it
 
01:49:27.709 --> 01:49:27.719 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm sure uh commissioner McIntyre
 
01:49:29.870 --> 01:49:29.880 align:start position:0%
could give us the exact number of years
 
01:49:32.390 --> 01:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
and days involved but it took a period
 
01:49:34.830 --> 01:49:34.840 align:start position:0%
of time it also takes a period of time
 
01:49:37.830 --> 01:49:37.840 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the financing there um
 
01:49:41.270 --> 01:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
there's not some special bank that
 
01:49:44.189 --> 01:49:44.199 align:start position:0%
gives away money for these things well I
 
01:49:47.910 --> 01:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
probably is but uh yeah there is it
 
01:49:49.990 --> 01:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
still takes just going through the
 
01:49:52.830 --> 01:49:52.840 align:start position:0%
permitting process uh of your planning
 
01:49:55.709 --> 01:49:55.719 align:start position:0%
board it's going to take a good 18
 
01:49:58.790 --> 01:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
months for a large facility to get
 
01:50:00.950 --> 01:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
redone because they're going to be well
 
01:50:03.189 --> 01:50:03.199 align:start position:0%
I don't like that traffic study let's do
 
01:50:05.350 --> 01:50:05.360 align:start position:0%
another traffic
 
01:50:09.310 --> 01:50:09.320 align:start position:0%
study well if I may Mr chairman I I
 
01:50:10.990 --> 01:50:11.000 align:start position:0%
serve on the planning board in my town
 
01:50:14.109 --> 01:50:14.119 align:start position:0%
so I'm familiar with the process and and
 
01:50:18.589 --> 01:50:18.599 align:start position:0%
um you know um I would say in each of
 
01:50:20.030 --> 01:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
the cases we've heard you know might
 
01:50:21.950 --> 01:50:21.960 align:start position:0%
take 18 months to do this and you you
 
01:50:23.189 --> 01:50:23.199 align:start position:0%
know you're' going to have to get the
 
01:50:25.310 --> 01:50:25.320 align:start position:0%
permission of the community to get
 
01:50:27.350 --> 01:50:27.360 align:start position:0%
financing um one of the things that I
 
01:50:29.310 --> 01:50:29.320 align:start position:0%
heard on the last bill from the director
 
01:50:31.030 --> 01:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
was that
 
01:50:34.430 --> 01:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
apparently and this may be a good thing
 
01:50:36.390 --> 01:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
um or not I guess we'll find out over
 
01:50:38.830 --> 01:50:38.840 align:start position:0%
time but it is clear that the folks who
 
01:50:41.470 --> 01:50:41.480 align:start position:0%
are coming in to do business are not Mom
 
01:50:43.910 --> 01:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
and Pop operators who who don't
 
01:50:45.910 --> 01:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
understand the process of of building
 
01:50:47.589 --> 01:50:47.599 align:start position:0%
these things of getting the permits of
 
01:50:50.430 --> 01:50:50.440 align:start position:0%
getting the approvals um
 
01:50:53.430 --> 01:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
they're they're big players in the in
 
01:50:56.470 --> 01:50:56.480 align:start position:0%
the gaming industry um they know what
 
01:51:00.149 --> 01:51:00.159 align:start position:0%
they're doing they know how to do this
 
01:51:02.629 --> 01:51:02.639 align:start position:0%
and I can't imagine that they want to
 
01:51:06.109 --> 01:51:06.119 align:start position:0%
tie their people up for 10 years um
 
01:51:08.069 --> 01:51:08.079 align:start position:0%
unless there is something else going on
 
01:51:11.629 --> 01:51:11.639 align:start position:0%
and so I you know I understand again I
 
01:51:13.550 --> 01:51:13.560 align:start position:0%
will say again I understand that this
 
01:51:16.189 --> 01:51:16.199 align:start position:0%
isn't going to happen overnight um and
 
01:51:18.589 --> 01:51:18.599 align:start position:0%
perhaps four years to commence
 
01:51:20.629 --> 01:51:20.639 align:start position:0%
operations is not
 
01:51:23.030 --> 01:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
sufficient but going from four years to
 
01:51:26.350 --> 01:51:26.360 align:start position:0%
10 years particularly given the nature
 
01:51:28.390 --> 01:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
of the business and the players who are
 
01:51:30.229 --> 01:51:30.239 align:start position:0%
who are coming into the state of New
 
01:51:33.270 --> 01:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I I I think to to tie the
 
01:51:36.109 --> 01:51:36.119 align:start position:0%
hands of a community for 10 years is is
 
01:51:36.119 --> 01:51:37.189 align:start position:0%
hands of a community for 10 years is is
just

01:51:37.189 --> 01:51:37.199 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:51:40.149 --> 01:51:40.159 align:start position:0%
inherently um
 
01:51:42.030 --> 01:51:42.040 align:start position:0%
extravagant represent
 
01:51:44.990 --> 01:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
elberger thank you Mr chair I just did a
 
01:51:46.990 --> 01:51:47.000 align:start position:0%
a quick Google search the Sears in
 
01:51:49.550 --> 01:51:49.560 align:start position:0%
nashwa which is the space that is now
 
01:51:52.270 --> 01:51:52.280 align:start position:0%
occupied by the Nash closed permanently
 
01:51:56.669 --> 01:51:56.679 align:start position:0%
in February of 2020 so in just over 5
 
01:51:59.270 --> 01:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
years they took care of
 
01:52:01.430 --> 01:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
everything and that's an enormous
 
01:52:04.870 --> 01:52:04.880 align:start position:0%
facility so I would tend to
 
01:52:08.149 --> 01:52:08.159 align:start position:0%
support the notion that 10 years is way
 
01:52:08.159 --> 01:52:13.910 align:start position:0%
support the notion that 10 years is way
too

01:52:13.910 --> 01:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:17.470 --> 01:52:17.480 align:start position:0%
long represent om did you have a your
 
01:52:18.950 --> 01:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
light is on yeah I was hoping to ask
 
01:52:20.669 --> 01:52:20.679 align:start position:0%
director McIntyre if he could weigh in
 
01:52:29.270 --> 01:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:31.830 --> 01:52:31.840 align:start position:0%
sure it's it's okay I can give you
 
01:52:35.229 --> 01:52:35.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:37.990 --> 01:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
invited uh certainly the Nash is the
 
01:52:40.149 --> 01:52:40.159 align:start position:0%
largest facility we have in the state um
 
01:52:42.470 --> 01:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
but the individuals who own that had
 
01:52:44.669 --> 01:52:44.679 align:start position:0%
tremendous resources to bring to bear to
 
01:52:47.990 --> 01:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
sort of make it happen um the longest
 
01:52:49.790 --> 01:52:49.800 align:start position:0%
project I ever saw that lingered would
 
01:52:51.990 --> 01:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
have been the Rockingham Park project
 
01:52:54.669 --> 01:52:54.679 align:start position:0%
which I think was probably a decade uh
 
01:52:58.109 --> 01:52:58.119 align:start position:0%
in terms of getting that that approved
 
01:53:00.669 --> 01:53:00.679 align:start position:0%
but the process goes you go to the town
 
01:53:03.030 --> 01:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
first and you come to us last you have
 
01:53:04.310 --> 01:53:04.320 align:start position:0%
to get Town approval first before you
 
01:53:06.510 --> 01:53:06.520 align:start position:0%
come to us and then we have our approval
 
01:53:08.870 --> 01:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
process um but it's usually done un lock
 
01:53:11.589 --> 01:53:11.599 align:start position:0%
step not we don't wait to help you
 
01:53:14.910 --> 01:53:14.920 align:start position:0%
before you you apply with us but we you
 
01:53:17.149 --> 01:53:17.159 align:start position:0%
last approval like today the Rochester
 
01:53:19.189 --> 01:53:19.199 align:start position:0%
facility is getting its approval today
 
01:53:20.950 --> 01:53:20.960 align:start position:0%
but it's it's final approval the whole
 
01:53:23.109 --> 01:53:23.119 align:start position:0%
process our folks work with you on on
 
01:53:24.790 --> 01:53:24.800 align:start position:0%
your internal controls your surveillance
 
01:53:28.790 --> 01:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
plan your cash path all those things so
 
01:53:31.510 --> 01:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
um the Nash was a special example
 
01:53:34.149 --> 01:53:34.159 align:start position:0%
because it is so large um but it's I
 
01:53:36.109 --> 01:53:36.119 align:start position:0%
think Conway might have been five
 
01:53:38.350 --> 01:53:38.360 align:start position:0%
years uh the facility in Conway because
 
01:53:41.069 --> 01:53:41.079 align:start position:0%
they went through a couple of towns
 
01:53:45.430 --> 01:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
approval rejection lawsuit hearing it I
 
01:53:47.069 --> 01:53:47.079 align:start position:0%
think that was five could be wrong but
 
01:53:49.229 --> 01:53:49.239 align:start position:0%
it was a long process what what did you
 
01:53:51.109 --> 01:53:51.119 align:start position:0%
say took 10
 
01:53:54.550 --> 01:53:54.560 align:start position:0%
years I mean certainly if it can jam up
 
01:53:56.709 --> 01:53:56.719 align:start position:0%
so this is game's a chance so this is
 
01:54:00.189 --> 01:54:00.199 align:start position:0%
just real sort of card games um table
 
01:54:00.199 --> 01:54:01.950 align:start position:0%
just real sort of card games um table
games

01:54:01.950 --> 01:54:01.960 align:start position:0%
games
 
01:54:05.229 --> 01:54:05.239 align:start position:0%
um it would be odd to sort
 
01:54:08.109 --> 01:54:08.119 align:start position:0%
of you know file an application every
 
01:54:10.069 --> 01:54:10.079 align:start position:0%
city or town because there's 220 and
 
01:54:11.830 --> 01:54:11.840 align:start position:0%
most of them don't have enough people to
 
01:54:14.669 --> 01:54:14.679 align:start position:0%
actually support a gaming chance uh and
 
01:54:16.189 --> 01:54:16.199 align:start position:0%
the facilities that are open now are
 
01:54:20.069 --> 01:54:20.079 align:start position:0%
really the ones you would have ideally
 
01:54:22.030 --> 01:54:22.040 align:start position:0%
because they have both table games and
 
01:54:25.870 --> 01:54:25.880 align:start position:0%
machine worked together well um I I
 
01:54:27.430 --> 01:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
don't have an opinion on it it would be
 
01:54:28.870 --> 01:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
a decision by you well what what I was
 
01:54:30.750 --> 01:54:30.760 align:start position:0%
asking is you when you first sat down
 
01:54:32.709 --> 01:54:32.719 align:start position:0%
you said I thought you said something
 
01:54:35.229 --> 01:54:35.239 align:start position:0%
took 10 years to get approved uh the
 
01:54:36.830 --> 01:54:36.840 align:start position:0%
rock Rockingham Park which did not get
 
01:54:38.550 --> 01:54:38.560 align:start position:0%
approved the casino rockan Park that
 
01:54:38.560 --> 01:54:39.669 align:start position:0%
approved the casino rockan Park that
process

01:54:39.669 --> 01:54:39.679 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:54:42.229 --> 01:54:42.239 align:start position:0%
lasted um the Millennium folks when
 
01:54:44.149 --> 01:54:44.159 align:start position:0%
there was the casino bill under Governor
 
01:54:46.629 --> 01:54:46.639 align:start position:0%
Hassen yeah uh they had worked on that
 
01:54:50.069 --> 01:54:50.079 align:start position:0%
project probably for oh probably 10
 
01:54:54.069 --> 01:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
years um through from 20
 
01:54:55.750 --> 01:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
so I'm just saying that's the longest I
 
01:54:57.470 --> 01:54:57.480 align:start position:0%
know of there project that didn't get
 
01:55:00.589 --> 01:55:00.599 align:start position:0%
approved and they spent Millions so 10
 
01:55:02.550 --> 01:55:02.560 align:start position:0%
years isn't out of the question it's
 
01:55:04.030 --> 01:55:04.040 align:start position:0%
unusual but it's not out of the question
 
01:55:05.629 --> 01:55:05.639 align:start position:0%
correct correct now obviously they were
 
01:55:08.669 --> 01:55:08.679 align:start position:0%
having to change then standing state law
 
01:55:10.550 --> 01:55:10.560 align:start position:0%
so obviously that takes a whole other
 
01:55:12.510 --> 01:55:12.520 align:start position:0%
process to get through this legislature
 
01:55:16.390 --> 01:55:16.400 align:start position:0%
but Mr chairman yes sir that that
 
01:55:18.750 --> 01:55:18.760 align:start position:0%
project um was
 
01:55:22.030 --> 01:55:22.040 align:start position:0%
not a a proposal under existing state
 
01:55:24.430 --> 01:55:24.440 align:start position:0%
law LA and it was just a question of
 
01:55:26.310 --> 01:55:26.320 align:start position:0%
getting the permits from the town and
 
01:55:27.629 --> 01:55:27.639 align:start position:0%
then getting the approval from the
 
01:55:30.069 --> 01:55:30.079 align:start position:0%
Lottery Commission it involved an effort
 
01:55:32.750 --> 01:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
to change state law to permit a casino
 
01:55:34.709 --> 01:55:34.719 align:start position:0%
to exist within the bounds of the State
 
01:55:37.950 --> 01:55:37.960 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire so I'm not sure that
 
01:55:44.189 --> 01:55:44.199 align:start position:0%
that's uh an appropriate e example um
 
01:55:46.270 --> 01:55:46.280 align:start position:0%
and I I guess I would ask the director
 
01:55:48.430 --> 01:55:48.440 align:start position:0%
if there any other examples he cited two
 
01:55:51.390 --> 01:55:51.400 align:start position:0%
now that both took five years um are
 
01:55:54.030 --> 01:55:54.040 align:start position:0%
there any other examp you can think of
 
01:56:18.870 --> 01:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:22.470 --> 01:56:22.480 align:start position:0%
five thank you represent BS thank you Mr
 
01:56:24.390 --> 01:56:24.400 align:start position:0%
chairman I'd like to ask you a question
 
01:56:27.069 --> 01:56:27.079 align:start position:0%
if I could please uh why did the
 
01:56:31.390 --> 01:56:31.400 align:start position:0%
Rockingham Park uh project fail uh it
 
01:56:33.069 --> 01:56:33.079 align:start position:0%
was a vote of legislature and the vote
 
01:56:38.189 --> 01:56:38.199 align:start position:0%
was negative okay okay thank you follow
 
01:56:40.189 --> 01:56:40.199 align:start position:0%
not not a followup but just comment you
 
01:56:41.669 --> 01:56:41.679 align:start position:0%
know I'm hearing a lot of discussion
 
01:56:44.189 --> 01:56:44.199 align:start position:0%
over here about I think this and I think
 
01:56:46.270 --> 01:56:46.280 align:start position:0%
that but like I've already said
 
01:56:49.990 --> 01:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
experience tells me that 5 to 10 years
 
01:56:54.470 --> 01:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
is within R uh within reasonable means
 
01:56:55.910 --> 01:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
we've already heard couple these
 
01:56:59.109 --> 01:56:59.119 align:start position:0%
projects took five years so four to 10 I
 
01:57:01.830 --> 01:57:01.840 align:start position:0%
mean somewhere between 4 and 10 is five
 
01:57:03.990 --> 01:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
and my son's been at it for five years
 
01:57:06.270 --> 01:57:06.280 align:start position:0%
and he hasn't even Broken Ground done
 
01:57:07.830 --> 01:57:07.840 align:start position:0%
anything yet other than get through the
 
01:57:10.350 --> 01:57:10.360 align:start position:0%
permitting process and like I said the
 
01:57:11.510 --> 01:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
only reason he got through the
 
01:57:14.189 --> 01:57:14.199 align:start position:0%
permitting process was due to go to
 
01:57:17.149 --> 01:57:17.159 align:start position:0%
court and filing a lawsuit he won the
 
01:57:19.350 --> 01:57:19.360 align:start position:0%
lawsuit and then the judge had to go
 
01:57:22.589 --> 01:57:22.599 align:start position:0%
back and go after the town and put the
 
01:57:24.069 --> 01:57:24.079 align:start position:0%
town on notice that they're going to
 
01:57:26.510 --> 01:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
issue the permit otherwise he'd still be
 
01:57:29.189 --> 01:57:29.199 align:start position:0%
waiting so four to 10 years very
 
01:57:32.069 --> 01:57:32.079 align:start position:0%
reasonable representative
 
01:57:34.589 --> 01:57:34.599 align:start position:0%
Brier kind of listening to this
 
01:57:38.310 --> 01:57:38.320 align:start position:0%
discussion and uh I was uh the selectman
 
01:57:40.189 --> 01:57:40.199 align:start position:0%
rep to the planning board in the town of
 
01:57:42.030 --> 01:57:42.040 align:start position:0%
Northwood I was kind of involved with
 
01:57:44.550 --> 01:57:44.560 align:start position:0%
town of Northwood for 21 years and I'm
 
01:57:47.229 --> 01:57:47.239 align:start position:0%
kind of looking at this and uh what is a
 
01:57:49.830 --> 01:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
reasonable it sounds like FES too little
 
01:57:53.669 --> 01:57:53.679 align:start position:0%
T like I was thinking why don't we just
 
01:57:56.830 --> 01:57:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:01.149 --> 01:58:01.159 align:start position:0%
work as opposed to you know just I don't
 
01:58:03.470 --> 01:58:03.480 align:start position:0%
have a problem the 10 years but if you
 
01:58:05.430 --> 01:58:05.440 align:start position:0%
have to get everybody on board if it's
 
01:58:07.470 --> 01:58:07.480 align:start position:0%
like seven or eight years would that
 
01:58:09.550 --> 01:58:09.560 align:start position:0%
work well I guess we'll ask that
 
01:58:11.270 --> 01:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
questiones I was going to say Mr
 
01:58:15.470 --> 01:58:15.480 align:start position:0%
chairman U um responding to my colleague
 
01:58:17.870 --> 01:58:17.880 align:start position:0%
um representative ORS I think the
 
01:58:22.149 --> 01:58:22.159 align:start position:0%
testimony we've heard here um about EX
 
01:58:25.030 --> 01:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
examples specific examples has
 
01:58:27.910 --> 01:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
been um I the director said he couldn't
 
01:58:30.750 --> 01:58:30.760 align:start position:0%
think of any other than Rockingham that
 
01:58:36.109 --> 01:58:36.119 align:start position:0%
was more than five years um so you know
 
01:58:38.669 --> 01:58:38.679 align:start position:0%
um that's based on not opinion that's
 
01:58:41.910 --> 01:58:41.920 align:start position:0%
based on you know what what his
 
01:58:44.510 --> 01:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
experience is I I would say this Mr Mr
 
01:58:46.350 --> 01:58:46.360 align:start position:0%
chairman is it appropriate for me to
 
01:58:48.589 --> 01:58:48.599 align:start position:0%
offer an amendment to the amendment that
 
01:58:53.310 --> 01:58:53.320 align:start position:0%
would change the 10 years to six years
 
01:58:55.830 --> 01:58:55.840 align:start position:0%
sure it's
 
01:58:59.790 --> 01:58:59.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate how do other uh so are you
 
01:59:03.550 --> 01:59:03.560 align:start position:0%
saying that if this said six instead of
 
01:59:06.990 --> 01:59:07.000 align:start position:0%
10 you would you would be OTP on this I
 
01:59:09.189 --> 01:59:09.199 align:start position:0%
if we could change the 10 to six I I
 
01:59:11.510 --> 01:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
would be far more comfortable with that
 
01:59:16.149 --> 01:59:16.159 align:start position:0%
yes sir yes I I would I would vote OTP
 
01:59:20.229 --> 01:59:20.239 align:start position:0%
otpa all right um I don't know between
 
01:59:21.870 --> 01:59:21.880 align:start position:0%
represent Aly and represent Southworth
 
01:59:24.030 --> 01:59:24.040 align:start position:0%
who had your light on first so I've had
 
01:59:25.750 --> 01:59:25.760 align:start position:0%
my light on for a long time okay we'll
 
01:59:29.149 --> 01:59:29.159 align:start position:0%
go with representative Aly yes this is
 
01:59:31.750 --> 01:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
fundamental to this
 
01:59:35.510 --> 01:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
bill um it talks
 
01:59:38.589 --> 01:59:38.599 align:start position:0%
about games of
 
01:59:41.109 --> 01:59:41.119 align:start position:0%
chance that means that we are
 
01:59:43.310 --> 01:59:43.320 align:start position:0%
considering as
 
01:59:48.830 --> 01:59:48.840 align:start position:0%
identical on the effects of poker
 
01:59:52.149 --> 01:59:52.159 align:start position:0%
games and maybe a little Roulette in in
 
01:59:56.030 --> 01:59:56.040 align:start position:0%
a place on
 
01:59:58.310 --> 01:59:58.320 align:start position:0%
and and
 
02:00:01.550 --> 02:00:01.560 align:start position:0%
HRM and H
 
02:00:06.870 --> 02:00:06.880 align:start position:0%
H HHR you call it nowadays uh
 
02:00:12.750 --> 02:00:12.760 align:start position:0%
and uh V VT machines they're total those
 
02:00:15.109 --> 02:00:15.119 align:start position:0%
last two are in a totally different
 
02:00:17.950 --> 02:00:17.960 align:start position:0%
category they were banned and they still
 
02:00:20.750 --> 02:00:20.760 align:start position:0%
are banned in our in our legislative
 
02:00:23.470 --> 02:00:23.480 align:start position:0%
language um
 
02:00:27.990 --> 02:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
back on back many decades ago and it's
 
02:00:31.189 --> 02:00:31.199 align:start position:0%
still in the language even though PE
 
02:00:35.589 --> 02:00:35.599 align:start position:0%
it's old language so the new stuff can
 
02:00:38.229 --> 02:00:38.239 align:start position:0%
just just say never mind that we've
 
02:00:40.669 --> 02:00:40.679 align:start position:0%
changed it but you haven't changed it
 
02:00:44.030 --> 02:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
there but they are very different things
 
02:00:46.229 --> 02:00:46.239 align:start position:0%
they are the reason that a lot of us
 
02:00:49.750 --> 02:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
spent a lot of time for about 12 15
 
02:00:52.870 --> 02:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
years fighting against
 
02:00:56.629 --> 02:00:56.639 align:start position:0%
the casinos and won every single vote
 
02:00:59.950 --> 02:00:59.960 align:start position:0%
until after we went
 
02:01:03.629 --> 02:01:03.639 align:start position:0%
into uh after the pandemic
 
02:01:06.189 --> 02:01:06.199 align:start position:0%
ended but
 
02:01:09.550 --> 02:01:09.560 align:start position:0%
um what worries me is that if we're
 
02:01:11.350 --> 02:01:11.360 align:start position:0%
treating them the
 
02:01:14.950 --> 02:01:14.960 align:start position:0%
same then any place that has been
 
02:01:19.069 --> 02:01:19.079 align:start position:0%
licensed for poker which is something
 
02:01:22.109 --> 02:01:22.119 align:start position:0%
that a lot of people like to play and it
 
02:01:24.270 --> 02:01:24.280 align:start position:0%
used to be played in the back rooms of
 
02:01:29.550 --> 02:01:29.560 align:start position:0%
their ho houses uh every weekend uh but
 
02:01:34.589 --> 02:01:34.599 align:start position:0%
we finally legalized it and and it is
 
02:01:39.350 --> 02:01:39.360 align:start position:0%
part of the games of chance now uh every
 
02:01:41.709 --> 02:01:41.719 align:start position:0%
single one of those could be turned
 
02:01:47.750 --> 02:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
without a vote into a major
 
02:01:49.709 --> 02:01:49.719 align:start position:0%
casino and there are a lot of them
 
02:01:53.270 --> 02:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
around the state I don't know how many
 
02:02:05.069 --> 02:02:05.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:09.390 --> 02:02:09.400 align:start position:0%
casinos aren't uh poker rooms considered
 
02:02:10.990 --> 02:02:11.000 align:start position:0%
games of
 
02:02:15.189 --> 02:02:15.199 align:start position:0%
chance game of skill yeah no it is game
 
02:02:41.270 --> 02:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:49.790 --> 02:02:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:54.189 --> 02:02:54.199 align:start position:0%
same and and the poker that we legalized
 
02:02:57.830 --> 02:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
those our ours opened as a poker
 
02:03:01.350 --> 02:03:01.360 align:start position:0%
room and everybody was
 
02:03:03.910 --> 02:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
delighted and then all of a sudden it
 
02:03:07.390 --> 02:03:07.400 align:start position:0%
had been turned into a
 
02:03:10.390 --> 02:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
casino but this this bill doesn't
 
02:03:13.270 --> 02:03:13.280 align:start position:0%
address that I mean the the concern that
 
02:03:15.189 --> 02:03:15.199 align:start position:0%
you have isn't going to be addressed by
 
02:03:18.310 --> 02:03:18.320 align:start position:0%
this bill this bill is giving localities
 
02:03:22.830 --> 02:03:22.840 align:start position:0%
a local option to to stop to if if they
 
02:03:27.350 --> 02:03:27.360 align:start position:0%
aren't already a game of chance place
 
02:03:30.830 --> 02:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
and my understanding was that games of
 
02:03:40.030 --> 02:03:40.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:42.669 --> 02:03:42.679 align:start position:0%
rooms but if we don't you say there's
 
02:04:02.270 --> 02:04:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:07.229 --> 02:04:07.239 align:start position:0%
okay so HP 247 is allowing
 
02:04:11.350 --> 02:04:11.360 align:start position:0%
HHR yes this is games of chance right
 
02:04:16.350 --> 02:04:16.360 align:start position:0%
and you're and um director McIntyre is
 
02:04:20.669 --> 02:04:20.679 align:start position:0%
are in the title of games of chance does
 
02:04:32.390 --> 02:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:33.790 --> 02:04:33.800 align:start position:0%
okay because that was that's something
 
02:04:38.069 --> 02:04:38.079 align:start position:0%
that we and video Lottery terminals are
 
02:04:44.069 --> 02:04:44.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:46.629 --> 02:04:46.639 align:start position:0%
where so this wouldn't automatically
 
02:04:46.639 --> 02:04:48.589 align:start position:0%
where so this wouldn't automatically
include

02:04:48.589 --> 02:04:48.599 align:start position:0%
include
 
02:05:01.310 --> 02:05:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:06.990 --> 02:05:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:10.669 --> 02:05:10.679 align:start position:0%
loopholes so is there anything in this
 
02:05:10.679 --> 02:05:17.470 align:start position:0%
loopholes so is there anything in this
language

02:05:17.470 --> 02:05:17.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:17.480 --> 02:05:19.109 align:start position:0%
 
that

02:05:19.109 --> 02:05:19.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:05:24.149 --> 02:05:24.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:28.069 --> 02:05:28.079 align:start position:0%
we were hit by a Lo loophole in our
 
02:05:32.270 --> 02:05:32.280 align:start position:0%
opinion but and represent you're you're
 
02:05:34.229 --> 02:05:34.239 align:start position:0%
you're worrying about the loophole being
 
02:05:37.390 --> 02:05:37.400 align:start position:0%
that this would allow for more than what
 
02:05:39.990 --> 02:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
you considered games of chance also you
 
02:05:41.390 --> 02:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
worried it could
 
02:05:44.109 --> 02:05:44.119 align:start position:0%
include uh well can't include HHR
 
02:05:47.589 --> 02:05:47.599 align:start position:0%
because you said that that has its own
 
02:05:50.750 --> 02:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
section actually VTS now would it's not
 
02:05:53.229 --> 02:05:53.239 align:start position:0%
approved yet VT has own section to
 
02:05:55.390 --> 02:05:55.400 align:start position:0%
that's what what we'll be looking at in
 
02:05:57.350 --> 02:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
hb2 this
 
02:06:00.549 --> 02:06:00.559 align:start position:0%
afternoon um yeah well the the way the
 
02:06:02.750 --> 02:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
governor did it
 
02:06:05.910 --> 02:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
yes but that would mean people would
 
02:06:09.510 --> 02:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
have to wouldn't they have to be
 
02:06:18.109 --> 02:06:18.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:21.229 --> 02:06:21.239 align:start position:0%
yeah representative South Southworth
 
02:06:25.189 --> 02:06:25.199 align:start position:0%
thanks back to the numbers uh issue um I
 
02:06:27.109 --> 02:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
know there have been a v variety of
 
02:06:28.990 --> 02:06:29.000 align:start position:0%
comments and maybe another amendment but
 
02:06:30.910 --> 02:06:30.920 align:start position:0%
for this amendment that we have in front
 
02:06:32.990 --> 02:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
of us would it be worth it to just do a
 
02:06:35.350 --> 02:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
straw poll how many people are willing
 
02:06:37.549 --> 02:06:37.559 align:start position:0%
to go along with the 10 years so then
 
02:06:39.510 --> 02:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
you'll know where we're
 
02:06:42.430 --> 02:06:42.440 align:start position:0%
at sure and then if that doesn't do well
 
02:06:44.109 --> 02:06:44.119 align:start position:0%
you could say eight years or something
 
02:06:47.229 --> 02:06:47.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:49.830 --> 02:06:49.840 align:start position:0%
moving okay can I just ask one
 
02:06:51.629 --> 02:06:51.639 align:start position:0%
clarifying question regarding
 
02:06:55.229 --> 02:06:55.239 align:start position:0%
representative opal um so if I'm
 
02:06:56.510 --> 02:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
understanding what representative Aly
 
02:07:00.310 --> 02:07:00.320 align:start position:0%
was getting to it is a concern that
 
02:07:01.870 --> 02:07:01.880 align:start position:0%
someone could
 
02:07:06.510 --> 02:07:06.520 align:start position:0%
file an application to have a poker room
 
02:07:08.189 --> 02:07:08.199 align:start position:0%
and that would preclude the community
 
02:07:13.109 --> 02:07:13.119 align:start position:0%
from voting to prevent that right and
 
02:07:19.549 --> 02:07:19.559 align:start position:0%
then that that um entity would then use
 
02:07:22.510 --> 02:07:22.520 align:start position:0%
that to get a license
 
02:07:27.069 --> 02:07:27.079 align:start position:0%
or um that that somehow the the town's
 
02:07:30.350 --> 02:07:30.360 align:start position:0%
inability to opt
 
02:07:33.510 --> 02:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
out would would essentially preclude its
 
02:07:36.030 --> 02:07:36.040 align:start position:0%
ability to opt out of historic horse
 
02:07:38.870 --> 02:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
racing or the video terminals well let
 
02:07:40.910 --> 02:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
represent El me answer that yeah I mean
 
02:07:42.229 --> 02:07:42.239 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to understand if that's
 
02:07:44.390 --> 02:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
the concern and and if the director
 
02:07:47.310 --> 02:07:47.320 align:start position:0%
could say whether that's
 
02:07:51.589 --> 02:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
feasible at least in my community it was
 
02:07:54.390 --> 02:07:54.400 align:start position:0%
considered a poker room it had some
 
02:07:57.510 --> 02:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
roulette um I think it may have
 
02:07:59.629 --> 02:07:59.639 align:start position:0%
occasionally had
 
02:08:03.669 --> 02:08:03.679 align:start position:0%
craps and but and all and both of those
 
02:08:17.669 --> 02:08:17.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:27.950 --> 02:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:31.030 --> 02:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
didn't we end up with 28 is the end date
 
02:08:34.149 --> 02:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:36.109 --> 02:08:36.119 align:start position:0%
moratorium that sounds familiar but
 
02:08:40.629 --> 02:08:40.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:40.639 --> 02:08:43.830 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:08:43.830 --> 02:08:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:47.310 --> 02:08:47.320 align:start position:0%
yeah 20
 
02:08:52.069 --> 02:08:52.079 align:start position:0%
2031 okay seven years
 
02:08:55.390 --> 02:08:55.400 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative elberger I guess
 
02:08:57.229 --> 02:08:57.239 align:start position:0%
I'm getting even more confused the more
 
02:08:59.990 --> 02:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
this conversation goes on if someone
 
02:09:01.589 --> 02:09:01.599 align:start position:0%
applies for a
 
02:09:04.629 --> 02:09:04.639 align:start position:0%
license and is approved for a license
 
02:09:07.310 --> 02:09:07.320 align:start position:0%
does that license cover
 
02:09:10.709 --> 02:09:10.719 align:start position:0%
everything or is a license limited
 
02:09:16.430 --> 02:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
to poker in small table games or is it
 
02:09:17.910 --> 02:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
once you get it you can do anything you
 
02:09:19.669 --> 02:09:19.679 align:start position:0%
want the director will answer that
 
02:09:21.870 --> 02:09:21.880 align:start position:0%
question took an opportunity the answer
 
02:09:23.510 --> 02:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
is no you would be eligible just for
 
02:09:25.750 --> 02:09:25.760 align:start position:0%
games of chance which are table games
 
02:09:27.830 --> 02:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
which are the candidly the least
 
02:09:30.189 --> 02:09:30.199 align:start position:0%
profitable of the games we that the
 
02:09:32.790 --> 02:09:32.800 align:start position:0%
lottery licenses so it's unlikely that
 
02:09:35.669 --> 02:09:35.679 align:start position:0%
you would have many of those crop
 
02:09:40.430 --> 02:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
up but is it completely
 
02:09:42.109 --> 02:09:42.119 align:start position:0%
prohibited that you could apply for
 
02:09:43.870 --> 02:09:43.880 align:start position:0%
games trans license no it's not it's
 
02:09:45.430 --> 02:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
just you wouldn't be eligible under the
 
02:09:47.589 --> 02:09:47.599 align:start position:0%
existing law for historic horse racing
 
02:09:50.669 --> 02:09:50.679 align:start position:0%
machines or the proposed video letter
 
02:09:52.790 --> 02:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
terminal um
 
02:09:54.950 --> 02:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
bills thank
 
02:09:58.669 --> 02:09:58.679 align:start position:0%
you representative Aly but
 
02:10:02.669 --> 02:10:02.679 align:start position:0%
what would stop someone from getting one
 
02:10:04.229 --> 02:10:04.239 align:start position:0%
of those
 
02:10:06.350 --> 02:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
licenses and
 
02:10:11.830 --> 02:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
then saying that this would allow them
 
02:10:15.709 --> 02:10:15.719 align:start position:0%
to get to that they are eligible for I
 
02:10:17.629 --> 02:10:17.639 align:start position:0%
don't understand this eligible for
 
02:10:20.069 --> 02:10:20.079 align:start position:0%
language that they are eligible to get a
 
02:10:25.510 --> 02:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
license for or VT or or historic horse
 
02:10:27.990 --> 02:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
racing in the HHR language there is a
 
02:10:29.669 --> 02:10:29.679 align:start position:0%
date of Eligibility you need to be in
 
02:10:32.109 --> 02:10:32.119 align:start position:0%
good standing as of a certain date
 
02:10:33.669 --> 02:10:33.679 align:start position:0%
having applied by a certain date and
 
02:10:35.750 --> 02:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't have been done that they
 
02:10:37.790 --> 02:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have finished that or wouldn't
 
02:10:39.549 --> 02:10:39.559 align:start position:0%
have completed that
 
02:10:39.559 --> 02:10:41.750 align:start position:0%
have completed that
process

02:10:41.750 --> 02:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:10:44.149 --> 02:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
correct obviously that any moratorium is
 
02:10:45.910 --> 02:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
obviously subject to a future voted
 
02:10:48.589 --> 02:10:48.599 align:start position:0%
legislature so it's 31 in law currently
 
02:10:53.390 --> 02:10:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:56.669 --> 02:10:56.679 align:start position:0%
you had mentioned earlier that you work
 
02:10:59.870 --> 02:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
with PE people to get their licensing
 
02:11:01.549 --> 02:11:01.559 align:start position:0%
which is that's the way government's
 
02:11:02.470 --> 02:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
supposed to
 
02:11:08.069 --> 02:11:08.079 align:start position:0%
work and uh however you don't issue the
 
02:11:11.350 --> 02:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
license if the law says that the the
 
02:11:13.950 --> 02:11:13.960 align:start position:0%
community has to approve it uh for
 
02:11:16.430 --> 02:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
example Kino where the community has to
 
02:11:18.350 --> 02:11:18.360 align:start position:0%
you're not issuing the license to
 
02:11:20.589 --> 02:11:20.599 align:start position:0%
operate that Keno machine until the
 
02:11:24.470 --> 02:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
community passes the uh or approves it
 
02:11:25.669 --> 02:11:25.679 align:start position:0%
correct we wouldn't accept an
 
02:11:28.109 --> 02:11:28.119 align:start position:0%
application if that was the case so
 
02:11:32.310 --> 02:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
there would and under this law as
 
02:11:35.510 --> 02:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
proposed the same situation would exist
 
02:11:36.990 --> 02:11:37.000 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
02:11:41.470 --> 02:11:41.480 align:start position:0%
correct so the bit about applying for a
 
02:11:43.270 --> 02:11:43.280 align:start position:0%
license and getting a license and then
 
02:11:46.310 --> 02:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
cutting the town out is a nonse no they
 
02:11:47.990 --> 02:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
go to the town first representative to
 
02:11:50.310 --> 02:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
to your question they Town go you go to
 
02:11:51.709 --> 02:11:51.719 align:start position:0%
the town first then you come to after
 
02:11:54.229 --> 02:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
the fact thank you I guess as a
 
02:11:57.149 --> 02:11:57.159 align:start position:0%
follow-up to that though this bill 737
 
02:12:00.189 --> 02:12:00.199 align:start position:0%
is an opt out bill so with what you just
 
02:12:01.870 --> 02:12:01.880 align:start position:0%
said does that still apply does the town
 
02:12:04.510 --> 02:12:04.520 align:start position:0%
still have to they would have to the
 
02:12:05.830 --> 02:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
town has to approve whatever they do
 
02:12:08.470 --> 02:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
obviously because the parking roads curb
 
02:12:10.270 --> 02:12:10.280 align:start position:0%
Cuts whatever but if they're opt the
 
02:12:12.069 --> 02:12:12.079 align:start position:0%
town votes stopped out like for example
 
02:12:14.870 --> 02:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
Salem um Salem voted to have gaming only
 
02:12:17.310 --> 02:12:17.320 align:start position:0%
in certain areas we respect that vote of
 
02:12:20.069 --> 02:12:20.079 align:start position:0%
the Salem of the town of Salem and if
 
02:12:21.709 --> 02:12:21.719 align:start position:0%
you send us the license application
 
02:12:24.270 --> 02:12:24.280 align:start position:0%
that's not in that area it's rejected
 
02:12:26.750 --> 02:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
okay so so the town
 
02:12:29.430 --> 02:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
still so I guess there's two levels of
 
02:12:33.589 --> 02:12:33.599 align:start position:0%
town here one level is the the boards in
 
02:12:35.990 --> 02:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
the town uh what you're saying is they
 
02:12:37.390 --> 02:12:37.400 align:start position:0%
you're not going to issue a license till
 
02:12:42.470 --> 02:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
the boards say okay the the other opt
 
02:12:44.149 --> 02:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
out or opt in depending on which one it
 
02:12:46.390 --> 02:12:46.400 align:start position:0%
is the town's people voting on that
 
02:12:48.990 --> 02:12:49.000 align:start position:0%
correct okay so there's still so I guess
 
02:12:51.510 --> 02:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
to to answer that concern there there's
 
02:12:55.750 --> 02:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
still if if a town does not want it they
 
02:12:59.149 --> 02:12:59.159 align:start position:0%
still at the board level can prevent it
 
02:13:01.350 --> 02:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
even if it's an opt out so this is an
 
02:13:02.910 --> 02:13:02.920 align:start position:0%
opt out where the town would have to opt
 
02:13:06.069 --> 02:13:06.079 align:start position:0%
out but it's not like I think represent
 
02:13:07.709 --> 02:13:07.719 align:start position:0%
Opel was concerned that they'll just put
 
02:13:09.950 --> 02:13:09.960 align:start position:0%
an application in and now the town is
 
02:13:12.030 --> 02:13:12.040 align:start position:0%
stuck that's not the case based on what
 
02:13:14.549 --> 02:13:14.559 align:start position:0%
director McIntyre is saying okay but
 
02:13:18.069 --> 02:13:18.079 align:start position:0%
this is totally SE opposite of the
 
02:13:21.510 --> 02:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
experience that we had because there is
 
02:13:24.910 --> 02:13:24.920 align:start position:0%
a another board that was created fairly
 
02:13:29.709 --> 02:13:29.719 align:start position:0%
recently that uh is quasi judicial and
 
02:13:37.390 --> 02:13:37.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:43.510 --> 02:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
boards and we had hanging over us on a
 
02:13:47.510 --> 02:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
one a requirement from that place that
 
02:13:52.790 --> 02:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
was saying that on you have to decide
 
02:13:54.950 --> 02:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
all of this within a reasonable amount
 
02:13:58.750 --> 02:13:58.760 align:start position:0%
of time and you have to have what we
 
02:14:02.270 --> 02:14:02.280 align:start position:0%
consider good reasons to do it
 
02:14:06.629 --> 02:14:06.639 align:start position:0%
and maybe it was because we had a
 
02:14:10.589 --> 02:14:10.599 align:start position:0%
planning board member who was pretty new
 
02:14:11.669 --> 02:14:11.679 align:start position:0%
and who
 
02:14:15.549 --> 02:14:15.559 align:start position:0%
spoke uh contemptuously I think it was
 
02:14:19.430 --> 02:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
of the applicant uh that we ended up
 
02:14:21.910 --> 02:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
with this dictum but we did end up with
 
02:14:21.920 --> 02:14:23.270 align:start position:0%
with this dictum but we did end up with
this

02:14:23.270 --> 02:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:14:23.280 --> 02:14:24.990 align:start position:0%
this
stim

02:14:24.990 --> 02:14:25.000 align:start position:0%
stim
 
02:14:27.709 --> 02:14:27.719 align:start position:0%
me representa y followed by represent
 
02:14:30.149 --> 02:14:30.159 align:start position:0%
opal yeah yes representative Aly that
 
02:14:32.669 --> 02:14:32.679 align:start position:0%
exists within a 60-day time limit within
 
02:14:35.189 --> 02:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
the planning board regulations it's not
 
02:14:37.750 --> 02:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
a separate board it's a it's a a
 
02:14:40.549 --> 02:14:40.559 align:start position:0%
function of law uh once the application
 
02:14:42.589 --> 02:14:42.599 align:start position:0%
is accepted and read in and public
 
02:14:45.149 --> 02:14:45.159 align:start position:0%
hearing is head a decision has to be
 
02:14:48.149 --> 02:14:48.159 align:start position:0%
made within 60 days uh my understanding
 
02:14:51.069 --> 02:14:51.079 align:start position:0%
of the reasoning for that was because
 
02:14:53.669 --> 02:14:53.679 align:start position:0%
there were certain communities that were
 
02:14:55.790 --> 02:14:55.800 align:start position:0%
well we use the term dilatory on the
 
02:14:58.990 --> 02:14:59.000 align:start position:0%
floor and then being polite to what was
 
02:15:00.430 --> 02:15:00.440 align:start position:0%
happening in some
 
02:15:03.350 --> 02:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
places this was actually a board that
 
02:15:06.310 --> 02:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
was put in because I heard about it
 
02:15:10.109 --> 02:15:10.119 align:start position:0%
first when he was talking about how uh
 
02:15:13.750 --> 02:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
they had stopped Lebanon from continuing
 
02:15:15.950 --> 02:15:15.960 align:start position:0%
to ask for a real
 
02:15:15.960 --> 02:15:17.750 align:start position:0%
to ask for a real
traffic

02:15:17.750 --> 02:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
traffic
 
02:15:20.549 --> 02:15:20.559 align:start position:0%
report still would have been within
 
02:15:20.559 --> 02:15:21.470 align:start position:0%
report still would have been within
represent

02:15:21.470 --> 02:15:21.480 align:start position:0%
represent
 
02:15:25.470 --> 02:15:25.480 align:start position:0%
op um well I will I will say that as a
 
02:15:27.510 --> 02:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
planning board member if you speak ill
 
02:15:30.069 --> 02:15:30.079 align:start position:0%
of an applicant before you've made a
 
02:15:32.990 --> 02:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
decision you've you pretty much put
 
02:15:35.229 --> 02:15:35.239 align:start position:0%
yourself in a position of being sued and
 
02:15:39.310 --> 02:15:39.320 align:start position:0%
and probably rightfully so but I I yeah
 
02:15:42.470 --> 02:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
exactly um but I W I will say I was
 
02:15:42.480 --> 02:15:43.430 align:start position:0%
exactly um but I W I will say I was
under

02:15:43.430 --> 02:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
under
 
02:15:47.229 --> 02:15:47.239 align:start position:0%
the misperception I guess um that this
 
02:15:51.149 --> 02:15:51.159 align:start position:0%
would have affected um HHR and and and
 
02:15:52.589 --> 02:15:52.599 align:start position:0%
potentially video
 
02:15:56.189 --> 02:15:56.199 align:start position:0%
terminals um taking those out of the
 
02:15:58.589 --> 02:15:58.599 align:start position:0%
equation the only example that's gone
 
02:16:01.549 --> 02:16:01.559 align:start position:0%
past 5 years was Rockingham Park and a
 
02:16:05.910 --> 02:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
casino um which again I would say uh if
 
02:16:08.750 --> 02:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
you're talking about opening a poker
 
02:16:11.549 --> 02:16:11.559 align:start position:0%
parlor or you know a small game of
 
02:16:14.430 --> 02:16:14.440 align:start position:0%
chance operation which is more likely
 
02:16:16.549 --> 02:16:16.559 align:start position:0%
than you're going to open some huge
 
02:16:20.350 --> 02:16:20.360 align:start position:0%
facility with 25 or 30 or 50 poker
 
02:16:20.360 --> 02:16:21.750 align:start position:0%
facility with 25 or 30 or 50 poker
tables

02:16:21.750 --> 02:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
tables
 
02:16:24.470 --> 02:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
um we're not talking about a huge amount
 
02:16:26.510 --> 02:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
of investment we're not talking about a
 
02:16:29.109 --> 02:16:29.119 align:start position:0%
casino we're not talking about you know
 
02:16:32.349 --> 02:16:32.359 align:start position:0%
those kinds of activities and so I would
 
02:16:33.549 --> 02:16:33.559 align:start position:0%
say even
 
02:16:37.910 --> 02:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
more um you know that that says to me 10
 
02:16:41.910 --> 02:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
years is just way way out of for for for
 
02:16:43.790 --> 02:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
this for what we're talking about 10
 
02:16:46.549 --> 02:16:46.559 align:start position:0%
years seems just excessive
 
02:16:51.950 --> 02:16:51.960 align:start position:0%
uh yes represent Malloy Mr chair uh
 
02:16:54.349 --> 02:16:54.359 align:start position:0%
uh representative Southworth uh
 
02:16:56.509 --> 02:16:56.519 align:start position:0%
recommended a straw pole are we pass
 
02:16:58.190 --> 02:16:58.200 align:start position:0%
that or are we moving into
 
02:17:00.990 --> 02:17:01.000 align:start position:0%
other areas here to I you know it's
 
02:17:02.790 --> 02:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
interesting I was just about to okay say
 
02:17:05.629 --> 02:17:05.639 align:start position:0%
that because it sounds like because of
 
02:17:07.950 --> 02:17:07.960 align:start position:0%
new understanding of this bill it sounds
 
02:17:10.030 --> 02:17:10.040 align:start position:0%
to me like the main impediment is the
 
02:17:13.230 --> 02:17:13.240 align:start position:0%
10year um but I want doing a straw poll
 
02:17:18.429 --> 02:17:18.439 align:start position:0%
so um if we if we amended this amendment
 
02:17:21.549 --> 02:17:21.559 align:start position:0%
to um so so there's two pieces here one
 
02:17:24.190 --> 02:17:24.200 align:start position:0%
is the two years of non-operation going
 
02:17:26.509 --> 02:17:26.519 align:start position:0%
to four years and then there's the other
 
02:17:29.709 --> 02:17:29.719 align:start position:0%
part of four years of a new after new
 
02:17:32.709 --> 02:17:32.719 align:start position:0%
application to 10 years so is is
 
02:17:34.190 --> 02:17:34.200 align:start position:0%
everyone first of all so there's two
 
02:17:36.469 --> 02:17:36.479 align:start position:0%
parts so the first part is everyone okay
 
02:17:38.030 --> 02:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
with the two years going to four years
 
02:17:42.589 --> 02:17:42.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:47.589 --> 02:17:47.599 align:start position:0%
hand okay so you one two 3 four five
 
02:17:51.030 --> 02:17:51.040 align:start position:0%
6 7 8 9 10 11 okay so we have enough
 
02:17:53.309 --> 02:17:53.319 align:start position:0%
people to go along with that the other
 
02:17:55.950 --> 02:17:55.960 align:start position:0%
part is the four years going to 10 years
 
02:17:57.469 --> 02:17:57.479 align:start position:0%
um I think we've heard a lot that 10
 
02:18:00.230 --> 02:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
years is too long how many of you are
 
02:18:02.870 --> 02:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
good with eight
 
02:18:09.270 --> 02:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
years one two three four five six
 
02:18:11.709 --> 02:18:11.719 align:start position:0%
seven8 it's not good enough because we
 
02:18:15.950 --> 02:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:19.549 --> 02:18:19.559 align:start position:0%
believe six years and you didn't ask for
 
02:18:21.990 --> 02:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
10 of might be
 
02:18:24.389 --> 02:18:24.399 align:start position:0%
10 well I I don't think 10's going to go
 
02:18:27.150 --> 02:18:27.160 align:start position:0%
anywhere because eight eight just didn't
 
02:18:29.509 --> 02:18:29.519 align:start position:0%
didn't do it how many would be okay with
 
02:18:29.519 --> 02:18:31.429 align:start position:0%
didn't do it how many would be okay with
six

02:18:31.429 --> 02:18:31.439 align:start position:0%
six
 
02:18:35.110 --> 02:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
years one two three four five six seven
 
02:18:38.070 --> 02:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
eight 11 12
 
02:18:40.389 --> 02:18:40.399 align:start position:0%
13 how many how many would be good with
 
02:18:40.399 --> 02:18:43.950 align:start position:0%
13 how many how many would be good with
seven

02:18:43.950 --> 02:18:43.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:46.709 --> 02:18:46.719 align:start position:0%
years well you're good with
 
02:18:49.629 --> 02:18:49.639 align:start position:0%
anything all right so it looks like six
 
02:18:53.230 --> 02:18:53.240 align:start position:0%
years is is where so so so then let me
 
02:18:55.349 --> 02:18:55.359 align:start position:0%
ask one last question then if we have an
 
02:18:57.230 --> 02:18:57.240 align:start position:0%
amendment the only change to the
 
02:18:59.629 --> 02:18:59.639 align:start position:0%
amendment that I've put forth would be
 
02:19:02.150 --> 02:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
that the 10 years goes to six years
 
02:19:03.429 --> 02:19:03.439 align:start position:0%
that's the only change who's going to
 
02:19:04.950 --> 02:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
vote for the ought to
 
02:19:09.910 --> 02:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
pass one two three four five six seven8
 
02:19:12.469 --> 02:19:12.479 align:start position:0%
nine 10 11 okay so we have enough to do
 
02:19:15.070 --> 02:19:15.080 align:start position:0%
that so why don't we uh maybe what I
 
02:19:19.389 --> 02:19:19.399 align:start position:0%
should do is uh recess this um we're
 
02:19:20.990 --> 02:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
going to be back here talking talking
 
02:19:22.429 --> 02:19:22.439 align:start position:0%
about uh
 
02:19:25.830 --> 02:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
hb2 and um and at some point when we get
 
02:19:28.389 --> 02:19:28.399 align:start position:0%
this amendment back we could uh vote on
 
02:19:31.910 --> 02:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
that so um represent
 
02:19:37.509 --> 02:19:37.519 align:start position:0%
Aly yes I still do not understand the
 
02:19:40.549 --> 02:19:40.559 align:start position:0%
relationship between this and being able
 
02:19:42.790 --> 02:19:42.800 align:start position:0%
to get a
 
02:19:45.870 --> 02:19:45.880 align:start position:0%
casino if this is got nothing to do with
 
02:19:45.880 --> 02:19:47.910 align:start position:0%
casino if this is got nothing to do with
a

02:19:47.910 --> 02:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:19:51.510 --> 02:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
casino uh by Casino you mean what I mean
 
02:19:53.429 --> 02:19:53.439 align:start position:0%
either the historic horse racing
 
02:19:55.150 --> 02:19:55.160 align:start position:0%
machines or the
 
02:19:57.710 --> 02:19:57.720 align:start position:0%
VTS well uh according to director
 
02:20:00.870 --> 02:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
McIntyre those are under separate areas
 
02:20:03.630 --> 02:20:03.640 align:start position:0%
they are under separate licenses but
 
02:20:07.270 --> 02:20:07.280 align:start position:0%
they somehow are tied together that you
 
02:20:10.030 --> 02:20:10.040 align:start position:0%
have to have this to have that or been
 
02:20:15.950 --> 02:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:20.830 --> 02:20:20.840 align:start position:0%
get exis La under existing law yeah
 
02:20:23.590 --> 02:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
because the more more T than we pass
 
02:20:27.790 --> 02:20:27.800 align:start position:0%
yeah but then if we pass
 
02:20:30.270 --> 02:20:30.280 align:start position:0%
VTS then
 
02:20:32.990 --> 02:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
then they would still need to pass they
 
02:20:36.270 --> 02:20:36.280 align:start position:0%
would still need to have to acquire a
 
02:20:37.750 --> 02:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
new set of
 
02:20:39.950 --> 02:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
licenses and go through the entire
 
02:20:42.590 --> 02:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
process for all that other stuff so you
 
02:20:46.349 --> 02:20:46.359 align:start position:0%
couldn't take a a a poker room and
 
02:20:49.469 --> 02:20:49.479 align:start position:0%
convert it into a casino without going
 
02:20:51.150 --> 02:20:51.160 align:start position:0%
through the process of
 
02:20:54.349 --> 02:20:54.359 align:start position:0%
taking your poker room and converting it
 
02:20:56.230 --> 02:20:56.240 align:start position:0%
into a casino which would be a
 
02:21:00.429 --> 02:21:00.439 align:start position:0%
separating separate process from
 
02:21:04.950 --> 02:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
scratch from scratch except for this
 
02:21:04.960 --> 02:21:14.389 align:start position:0%
scratch from scratch except for this
eligible

02:21:14.389 --> 02:21:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:14.399 --> 02:21:16.590 align:start position:0%
 
for

02:21:16.590 --> 02:21:16.600 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:21:16.600 --> 02:21:19.550 align:start position:0%
for
as

02:21:19.550 --> 02:21:19.560 align:start position:0%
as
 
02:21:22.670 --> 02:21:22.680 align:start position:0%
universe it just all that said to me all
 
02:21:25.230 --> 02:21:25.240 align:start position:0%
that says is you pass this background
 
02:21:27.070 --> 02:21:27.080 align:start position:0%
check now you can go ahead and apply for
 
02:21:27.080 --> 02:21:27.830 align:start position:0%
check now you can go ahead and apply for
the

02:21:27.830 --> 02:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:21:30.389 --> 02:21:30.399 align:start position:0%
licenses you're eligible for because
 
02:21:33.630 --> 02:21:33.640 align:start position:0%
you've done onethird of the process now
 
02:21:43.750 --> 02:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:45.830 --> 02:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
complete all
 
02:21:48.150 --> 02:21:48.160 align:start position:0%
right but that only applies to the
 
02:21:55.830 --> 02:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:57.950 --> 02:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
I think it's included in the BLT license
 
02:22:00.110 --> 02:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
it is what it also suggests I would
 
02:22:02.389 --> 02:22:02.399 align:start position:0%
think is that when we you know with the
 
02:22:03.190 --> 02:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
with the
 
02:22:06.349 --> 02:22:06.359 align:start position:0%
VT we should have an amendment that
 
02:22:10.190 --> 02:22:10.200 align:start position:0%
permits towns to opt out like
 
02:22:12.950 --> 02:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
this yeah that that's certainly possible
 
02:22:16.030 --> 02:22:16.040 align:start position:0%
and that would be separate from this
 
02:22:20.790 --> 02:22:20.800 align:start position:0%
yeah okay would this make it eligible
 
02:22:24.150 --> 02:22:24.160 align:start position:0%
no no this doesn't make VTS eligible
 
02:22:29.790 --> 02:22:29.800 align:start position:0%
right no you still have to okay so um
 
02:22:33.150 --> 02:22:33.160 align:start position:0%
then I'll call Ol see if I can get them
 
02:22:36.870 --> 02:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
to update that one number there's one
 
02:22:39.389 --> 02:22:39.399 align:start position:0%
more thing about it why did you add in
 
02:22:42.950 --> 02:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
there Roman two because it's the same
 
02:22:42.960 --> 02:22:49.270 align:start position:0%
there Roman two because it's the same
the

02:22:49.270 --> 02:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:53.670 --> 02:22:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:56.349 --> 02:22:56.359 align:start position:0%
I don't know if it's the same it doesn't
 
02:23:01.389 --> 02:23:01.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:03.830 --> 02:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
guess I just want to tell them the the
 
02:23:05.309 --> 02:23:05.319 align:start position:0%
less we tell them to change right now
 
02:23:08.910 --> 02:23:08.920 align:start position:0%
the more chance we'll have this done so
 
02:23:12.230 --> 02:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
if it's the same we're fine okay all
 
02:23:14.870 --> 02:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
right so um I'm going to recess the exec
 
02:23:18.190 --> 02:23:18.200 align:start position:0%
session until um uh Mr chairman before
 
02:23:20.190 --> 02:23:20.200 align:start position:0%
you do that do you want me to withdraw
 
02:23:25.110 --> 02:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
my motion of otpa on this amendment yes
 
02:23:27.870 --> 02:23:27.880 align:start position:0%
I will thank you so otpa has been
 
02:23:30.389 --> 02:23:30.399 align:start position:0%
withdrawn uh the OTP motion still is on
 
02:23:31.710 --> 02:23:31.720 align:start position:0%
the floor and we're going to try to get
 
02:23:34.309 --> 02:23:34.319 align:start position:0%
a different Amendment I'll recess this
 
02:23:34.319 --> 02:23:36.230 align:start position:0%
a different Amendment I'll recess this
until

02:23:36.230 --> 02:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
until
 
02:23:38.910 --> 02:23:38.920 align:start position:0%
uh let's say 1 pm I know it's going to
 
02:23:40.990 --> 02:23:41.000 align:start position:0%
be later than that but I'll recess this
 
02:23:44.790 --> 02:23:44.800 align:start position:0%
till 1M so that uh we do start we'll be
 
02:23:47.030 --> 02:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
within the time frame sometime I guess I
 
02:23:50.750 --> 02:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
could recess it to 1:30 yeah okay uh the
 
02:23:54.870 --> 02:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
executive session uh what we will do is
 
02:23:58.469 --> 02:23:58.479 align:start position:0%
let's can we get back here at uh
 
02:24:02.830 --> 02:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
1:15 to start working on hp2 until we
 
02:24:04.150 --> 02:24:04.160 align:start position:0%
get that
 
02:24:07.070 --> 02:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
um so okay so we we will come back at
 
02:24:08.990 --> 02:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
1:15 I've recessed the exec session

this handout is the current law which
 
03:29:36.510 --> 03:29:36.520 align:start position:0%

0.075 of the
 
03:30:27.790 --> 03:30:27.800 align:start position:0%
money then if you look at to hb2 what
 
03:30:29.910 --> 03:30:29.920 align:start position:0%
the governor's proposed the governor
 
03:30:33.990 --> 03:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
proposes a 55 45% split 55 to the
 
03:30:36.750 --> 03:30:36.760 align:start position:0%
operator 45 to New Hampshire to be split
 
03:30:39.309 --> 03:30:39.319 align:start position:0%

education trust fund and group to
 
03:30:47.110 --> 03:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
retirement and then I will not step on
 
03:30:49.349 --> 03:30:49.359 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang's toes because he'll he'll
 
03:30:52.389 --> 03:30:52.399 align:start position:0%
describe Senator Bill 83 but on my read
 
03:30:55.349 --> 03:30:55.359 align:start position:0%
of the current version of of cability 3
 
03:30:58.269 --> 03:30:58.279 align:start position:0%
the operator it's it's a 60 40% between
 
03:31:00.710 --> 03:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
the operator and New Hampshire we're
 
03:31:02.309 --> 03:31:02.319 align:start position:0%
under Senator Lang Bill the operator
 
03:31:05.750 --> 03:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
gets 26% Charities get 14 group two
 
03:31:08.790 --> 03:31:08.800 align:start position:0%
retirement gets 13 and the other half is
 
03:31:11.790 --> 03:31:11.800 align:start position:0%
split 50/50 to Lottery and to disabled
 
03:31:13.389 --> 03:31:13.399 align:start position:0%
folks who need some assistance with
 
03:31:16.550 --> 03:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
their property taxes so this is just a a
 
03:31:17.950 --> 03:31:17.960 align:start position:0%
high level summary and I hope you keep
 
03:31:19.870 --> 03:31:19.880 align:start position:0%
that in mind we look at the bills and
 
03:31:21.750 --> 03:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
decide what is the right split of
 
03:31:23.710 --> 03:31:23.720 align:start position:0%
revenue between the operator and revenue
 
03:31:26.429 --> 03:31:26.439 align:start position:0%

was
 
03:43:45.790 --> 03:43:45.800 align:start position:0%
why okay are used saying you can't
 
03:43:48.670 --> 03:43:48.680 align:start position:0%
introduce a build when you're not a
 
03:43:51.110 --> 03:43:51.120 align:start position:0%
member all right so let's get let's get
 
03:43:53.389 --> 03:43:53.399 align:start position:0%
to work on HB on
 
03:43:57.910 --> 03:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
hb2 you have a fiscal note quick
 
03:44:01.269 --> 03:44:01.279 align:start position:0%
guide uh is this from Dr yeah
 
03:44:03.790 --> 03:44:03.800 align:start position:0%
Dr and
 
03:44:07.590 --> 03:44:07.600 align:start position:0%
uh you should also have the handout of
 
03:44:15.750 --> 03:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:17.429 --> 03:44:17.439 align:start position:0%
uh the title being
 
03:44:20.910 --> 03:44:20.920 align:start position:0%
hb2 as introduced page 39 is at the top
 
03:44:22.550 --> 03:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
of the the
 
03:44:26.469 --> 03:44:26.479 align:start position:0%
handout um I think this document was was
 
03:44:28.830 --> 03:44:28.840 align:start position:0%
roughly I don't know 70 or 80 pages long
 
03:44:32.110 --> 03:44:32.120 align:start position:0%
but this is the 98 the page 98 pages but
 
03:44:39.670 --> 03:44:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:42.750 --> 03:44:42.760 align:start position:0%
Means let's see trying to find I looked
 
03:44:44.429 --> 03:44:44.439 align:start position:0%
at it this weekend I have some notes
 
03:44:49.110 --> 03:44:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:52.349 --> 03:44:52.359 align:start position:0%
here so I guess we'll just go make sense
 
03:44:54.189 --> 03:44:54.199 align:start position:0%
to go in order
 
03:45:01.950 --> 03:45:01.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:05.149 --> 03:45:05.159 align:start position:0%
39 one of the main the main components
 
03:45:08.469 --> 03:45:08.479 align:start position:0%
here is we had talked about uh VTS video
 
03:45:10.510 --> 03:45:10.520 align:start position:0%
Lottery terminals a little bit in our
 
03:45:13.070 --> 03:45:13.080 align:start position:0%
exing of
 
03:45:16.389 --> 03:45:16.399 align:start position:0%
737 and uh here here is introduced in
 
03:45:19.870 --> 03:45:19.880 align:start position:0%
hb2 the whole idea of of ushering in a
 
03:45:24.990 --> 03:45:25.000 align:start position:0%
uh New Era of uh Lottery machines so I
 
03:45:27.389 --> 03:45:27.399 align:start position:0%
guess let's let's kind of take
 
03:45:30.510 --> 03:45:30.520 align:start position:0%
this um not necessarily Page by page but
 
03:45:33.990 --> 03:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
maybe section by section so section 65
 
03:45:36.550 --> 03:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
66 and 68
 
03:45:36.560 --> 03:45:38.950 align:start position:0%
66 and 68
67

03:45:38.950 --> 03:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
67
 
03:45:41.590 --> 03:45:41.600 align:start position:0%
um and I guess
 
03:45:47.229 --> 03:45:47.239 align:start position:0%
68 and 69 yeah 65 65 through 69 deal
 
03:45:50.510 --> 03:45:50.520 align:start position:0%
with BLTs so the top of
 
03:45:53.349 --> 03:45:53.359 align:start position:0%
39 you can is what we were
 
03:45:56.110 --> 03:45:56.120 align:start position:0%
asking yeah you can ignore the the top
 
03:45:59.070 --> 03:45:59.080 align:start position:0%
of page it doesn't affect Revenue right
 
03:46:01.189 --> 03:46:01.199 align:start position:0%
we start with 65 so we're starting
 
03:46:03.510 --> 03:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
that's on line 20 so on the first page
 
03:46:05.790 --> 03:46:05.800 align:start position:0%
you're looking at starting at line 20
 
03:46:07.990 --> 03:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
and then going to the next page to uh
 
03:46:10.790 --> 03:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
line 16 that that's what we'll discuss
 
03:46:13.550 --> 03:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
first and that all deals with VTS video
 
03:46:16.189 --> 03:46:16.199 align:start position:0%
Lottery terminals and recognize
 
03:46:16.199 --> 03:46:18.149 align:start position:0%
Lottery terminals and recognize
representative

03:46:18.149 --> 03:46:18.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:46:22.229 --> 03:46:22.239 align:start position:0%
YY uh just a linguistic type thing I I'm
 
03:46:26.030 --> 03:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out how in
 
03:46:29.229 --> 03:46:29.239 align:start position:0%
law or in the budget the governor has
 
03:46:33.149 --> 03:46:33.159 align:start position:0%
any input other than suggest and then
 
03:46:35.950 --> 03:46:35.960 align:start position:0%
the finding section which I think it
 
03:46:39.309 --> 03:46:39.319 align:start position:0%
just that's just minor but the general
 
03:46:40.910 --> 03:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
court finds I don't care what the
 
03:46:40.920 --> 03:46:42.149 align:start position:0%
court finds I don't care what the
governor

03:46:42.149 --> 03:46:42.159 align:start position:0%
governor
 
03:46:44.590 --> 03:46:44.600 align:start position:0%
finds unless she finds a lot of gold
 
03:46:46.870 --> 03:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
some place that she's going to
 
03:46:48.870 --> 03:46:48.880 align:start position:0%
share well I think I think what's
 
03:46:50.870 --> 03:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
happening with this this
 
03:46:53.389 --> 03:46:53.399 align:start position:0%
isn't this isn't ready for prime time
 
03:46:56.229 --> 03:46:56.239 align:start position:0%
this is just like a starting document uh
 
03:47:00.189 --> 03:47:00.199 align:start position:0%
the um no no I realize that U Mr chair
 
03:47:02.910 --> 03:47:02.920 align:start position:0%
I'm just saying that should crossed out
 
03:47:06.149 --> 03:47:06.159 align:start position:0%
spitballing yeah yeah yeah
 
03:47:10.590 --> 03:47:10.600 align:start position:0%
okay represent elme yes
 
03:47:14.229 --> 03:47:14.239 align:start position:0%
um I think uh this is the governor's
 
03:47:14.239 --> 03:47:16.149 align:start position:0%
um I think uh this is the governor's
bill

03:47:16.149 --> 03:47:16.159 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:47:19.870 --> 03:47:19.880 align:start position:0%
it corre is yes uh expected to be
 
03:47:22.990 --> 03:47:23.000 align:start position:0%
redrafted by Finance before it's
 
03:47:26.269 --> 03:47:26.279 align:start position:0%
finished right um I would just like to
 
03:47:27.590 --> 03:47:27.600 align:start position:0%
put down a
 
03:47:32.110 --> 03:47:32.120 align:start position:0%
marker that uh Finance should be
 
03:47:38.110 --> 03:47:38.120 align:start position:0%
deciding where the funding would go yeah
 
03:47:41.189 --> 03:47:41.199 align:start position:0%
after it figures out what what else in
 
03:47:44.429 --> 03:47:44.439 align:start position:0%
the budget has to be funded and can't be
 
03:47:47.950 --> 03:47:47.960 align:start position:0%
funded by the revenues
 
03:47:50.149 --> 03:47:50.159 align:start position:0%
right yeah it's a good point we we don't
 
03:47:51.870 --> 03:47:51.880 align:start position:0%
need to figure out
 
03:47:54.710 --> 03:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
all all the funding or any of the
 
03:47:56.870 --> 03:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
funding issues per se where ways and
 
03:47:58.670 --> 03:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
means we're interested in what revenue
 
03:48:02.710 --> 03:48:02.720 align:start position:0%
is coming into the state represent
 
03:48:06.790 --> 03:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
opal um Mr chairman my understanding is
 
03:48:10.110 --> 03:48:10.120 align:start position:0%
that our role essentially is to make
 
03:48:12.229 --> 03:48:12.239 align:start position:0%
recommendations to the finance committee
 
03:48:15.070 --> 03:48:15.080 align:start position:0%
that that they'll ultimately correct opt
 
03:48:17.469 --> 03:48:17.479 align:start position:0%
a budget to present to the Full House
 
03:48:20.389 --> 03:48:20.399 align:start position:0%
yeah um one of the things that I think
 
03:48:23.670 --> 03:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
we should very strongly
 
03:48:26.710 --> 03:48:26.720 align:start position:0%
recommend is to adopt and I apologize
 
03:48:28.790 --> 03:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
for not having prepared this in advance
 
03:48:31.389 --> 03:48:31.399 align:start position:0%
but adopt similar
 
03:48:34.710 --> 03:48:34.720 align:start position:0%
language um for an opt out or opt-in
 
03:48:36.950 --> 03:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
provision the language could be borrowed
 
03:48:40.030 --> 03:48:40.040 align:start position:0%
I think from 737 which we just adopted
 
03:48:42.870 --> 03:48:42.880 align:start position:0%
mhm but I think they're absolutely if
 
03:48:45.750 --> 03:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
we're adopting a new form of Gaming
 
03:48:50.510 --> 03:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
I think um we should give the
 
03:48:52.750 --> 03:48:52.760 align:start position:0%
communities uh the
 
03:48:56.670 --> 03:48:56.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity to vote um on whether their
 
03:48:58.510 --> 03:48:58.520 align:start position:0%
own constituents their own
 
03:49:01.910 --> 03:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
citizens okay um would would concur
 
03:49:05.349 --> 03:49:05.359 align:start position:0%
right okay yeah and and whatever we
 
03:49:07.870 --> 03:49:07.880 align:start position:0%
decide here is you know it's it's not
 
03:49:10.590 --> 03:49:10.600 align:start position:0%
binding obviously we could we could give
 
03:49:13.469 --> 03:49:13.479 align:start position:0%
them all sorts of input we could just
 
03:49:15.269 --> 03:49:15.279 align:start position:0%
you know um
 
03:49:16.670 --> 03:49:16.680 align:start position:0%
I could close the meeting now and we
 
03:49:18.510 --> 03:49:18.520 align:start position:0%
could go home and they'll still they
 
03:49:20.469 --> 03:49:20.479 align:start position:0%
they'll do whatever they're going to do
 
03:49:22.510 --> 03:49:22.520 align:start position:0%
however if we have strong
 
03:49:24.429 --> 03:49:24.439 align:start position:0%
recommendations we hope that uh they'll
 
03:49:27.950 --> 03:49:27.960 align:start position:0%
take them into account uh uh
 
03:49:29.950 --> 03:49:29.960 align:start position:0%
representative elberger oh I'm sorry I
 
03:49:31.469 --> 03:49:31.479 align:start position:0%
keep missing representative Southworth
 
03:49:33.030 --> 03:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
let me go to representative Southworth
 
03:49:34.950 --> 03:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
okay thank you he's been very patient
 
03:49:38.269 --> 03:49:38.279 align:start position:0%
just for 65 as we've heard this morning
 
03:49:40.910 --> 03:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
um these revenues are going to vary
 
03:49:43.429 --> 03:49:43.439 align:start position:0%
tremendously we have a snapshot right
 
03:49:45.630 --> 03:49:45.640 align:start position:0%
now but we really don't have a good
 
03:49:47.510 --> 03:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
indication especially over a couple
 
03:49:49.710 --> 03:49:49.720 align:start position:0%
years what these revenues are going to
 
03:49:53.309 --> 03:49:53.319 align:start position:0%
be so we're really just um validating
 
03:49:55.030 --> 03:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
that they're going to be used but we
 
03:49:59.070 --> 03:49:59.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:01.910 --> 03:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
much um I mean based that's true we
 
03:50:03.269 --> 03:50:03.279 align:start position:0%
don't have an exact number based on what
 
03:50:05.990 --> 03:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
Lottery has said yeah you know that we
 
03:50:09.229 --> 03:50:09.239 align:start position:0%
really don't have over time unless you
 
03:50:13.030 --> 03:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:15.750 --> 03:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
yeah he's always got a Crystal bomb he
 
03:50:18.349 --> 03:50:18.359 align:start position:0%
just doesn't tell us what's exactly in
 
03:50:23.030 --> 03:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
it um I have an idea just based on Old
 
03:50:24.910 --> 03:50:24.920 align:start position:0%
information it's more than what I
 
03:50:27.630 --> 03:50:27.640 align:start position:0%
anticipated so generally this committee
 
03:50:29.910 --> 03:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
likes that yeah
 
03:50:32.550 --> 03:50:32.560 align:start position:0%
yes U so that's that's the only
 
03:50:35.309 --> 03:50:35.319 align:start position:0%
hesitancy I have on numbers is that it's
 
03:50:37.590 --> 03:50:37.600 align:start position:0%
I was I was really surprised at how big
 
03:50:39.910 --> 03:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
the Nash opening was so follow up well
 
03:50:41.550 --> 03:50:41.560 align:start position:0%
specifically I mean NASA doesn't have
 
03:50:45.469 --> 03:50:45.479 align:start position:0%
VTS obviously so specifically VTS
 
03:50:46.990 --> 03:50:47.000 align:start position:0%
um you know we we won't know that
 
03:50:49.510 --> 03:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
obviously right right and the followup
 
03:50:51.630 --> 03:50:51.640 align:start position:0%
would be um because the numbers aren't
 
03:50:54.830 --> 03:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
here um that were in the governor's uh
 
03:50:56.870 --> 03:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
Revenue but you're saying you expect
 
03:50:58.990 --> 03:50:59.000 align:start position:0%
them to be much higher yes thank you
 
03:51:00.710 --> 03:51:00.720 align:start position:0%
that's I just needed that cleared up
 
03:51:03.830 --> 03:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you repres you may want to
 
03:51:05.630 --> 03:51:05.640 align:start position:0%
stay there for a few minutes if you
 
03:51:09.750 --> 03:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
don't mind uh representative um elberger
 
03:51:11.950 --> 03:51:11.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thanks for taking yet
 
03:51:16.070 --> 03:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
more questions um I know you cannot tell
 
03:51:19.030 --> 03:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
us how much money might come in as
 
03:51:21.429 --> 03:51:21.439 align:start position:0%
additional funding from
 
03:51:26.309 --> 03:51:26.319 align:start position:0%
gambling the uh estimate from
 
03:51:30.550 --> 03:51:30.560 align:start position:0%
Dr is that with the cuts to some other
 
03:51:30.560 --> 03:51:32.189 align:start position:0%
Dr is that with the cuts to some other
taxes

03:51:32.189 --> 03:51:32.199 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
03:51:35.710 --> 03:51:35.720 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund would be losing
 
03:51:39.309 --> 03:51:39.319 align:start position:0%
about $95 million because of cuts in
 
03:51:41.990 --> 03:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
business taxes and other are you
 
03:51:45.149 --> 03:51:45.159 align:start position:0%
anticipating as much as potentially 9 $5
 
03:51:48.630 --> 03:51:48.640 align:start position:0%
million coming out of gambling from the
 
03:51:51.630 --> 03:51:51.640 align:start position:0%
new VT machines that would be going in
 
03:51:56.550 --> 03:51:56.560 align:start position:0%
to replace it yes that much yes the um
 
03:51:58.269 --> 03:51:58.279 align:start position:0%
so we're not changing machines like I
 
03:51:59.790 --> 03:51:59.800 align:start position:0%
suggested earlier this is just a machine
 
03:52:02.830 --> 03:52:02.840 align:start position:0%
that's migrating content right um but
 
03:52:04.950 --> 03:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
because it's HHR now goes to education
 
03:52:09.030 --> 03:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
trust fund and now VTS will be split two
 
03:52:11.710 --> 03:52:11.720 align:start position:0%
ways half education trust fund half
 
03:52:14.870 --> 03:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
under the hb2 half to the group two
 
03:52:17.269 --> 03:52:17.279 align:start position:0%
retirement system that number may you
 
03:52:19.149 --> 03:52:19.159 align:start position:0%
have to replace that funds because HR is
 
03:52:21.269 --> 03:52:21.279 align:start position:0%
being taken out entirely so that's why
 
03:52:23.070 --> 03:52:23.080 align:start position:0%
half of it's going in but I'll have
 
03:52:26.269 --> 03:52:26.279 align:start position:0%
better numbers but certainly VT revenues
 
03:52:27.870 --> 03:52:27.880 align:start position:0%
I would expect be much more than $95
 
03:52:30.830 --> 03:52:30.840 align:start position:0%
million a year thank
 
03:52:36.149 --> 03:52:36.159 align:start position:0%
you um I'm going to um have Senator Lang
 
03:52:37.710 --> 03:52:37.720 align:start position:0%
come up for a minute because he's got a
 
03:52:38.950 --> 03:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
he wants to say a few things then he has
 
03:52:46.030 --> 03:52:46.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:46.040 --> 03:52:49.670 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

03:52:49.670 --> 03:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:52.910 --> 03:52:52.920 align:start position:0%
again hi guys Senator Tim Lang um Senate
 
03:52:55.469 --> 03:52:55.479 align:start position:0%
wayam me's chair uh I served on this
 
03:52:56.910 --> 03:52:56.920 align:start position:0%
committee for my three terms in the
 
03:52:58.870 --> 03:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
house as well um I just wanted to bring
 
03:53:00.269 --> 03:53:00.279 align:start position:0%
some data to you I know as you're going
 
03:53:02.469 --> 03:53:02.479 align:start position:0%
through hb2 things like the tax rate is
 
03:53:04.469 --> 03:53:04.479 align:start position:0%
going to be a conversation and so I
 
03:53:06.349 --> 03:53:06.359 align:start position:0%
brought along with me I specifically
 
03:53:08.149 --> 03:53:08.159 align:start position:0%
reached out to the American gaming
 
03:53:11.550 --> 03:53:11.560 align:start position:0%
Association which is the the national um
 
03:53:13.910 --> 03:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
group that manages or or consults on
 
03:53:13.920 --> 03:53:14.950 align:start position:0%
group that manages or or consults on
gaming

03:53:14.950 --> 03:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
gaming
 
03:53:17.269 --> 03:53:17.279 align:start position:0%
um as well as Spectrum gaming which was
 
03:53:18.830 --> 03:53:18.840 align:start position:0%
our vendor we picked for the gaming
 
03:53:21.670 --> 03:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
commission which I also served on um on
 
03:53:24.189 --> 03:53:24.199 align:start position:0%
tax rates Nationwide so you can see what
 
03:53:26.229 --> 03:53:26.239 align:start position:0%
taxes look like Nationwide what other
 
03:53:28.269 --> 03:53:28.279 align:start position:0%
states are doing to as you compare New
 
03:53:30.269 --> 03:53:30.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so the one thing I do want to
 
03:53:33.830 --> 03:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
talk about it so uh you we passed in in
 
03:53:35.309 --> 03:53:35.319 align:start position:0%
the Senate ways of Means Committee a
 
03:53:38.070 --> 03:53:38.080 align:start position:0%
bill uh for video Lottery terminals um
 
03:53:39.750 --> 03:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
last week it'll be on the floor this
 
03:53:43.630 --> 03:53:43.640 align:start position:0%
Thursday our tax rate we set was 35% on
 
03:53:45.590 --> 03:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
our tax rate and I just want to put some
 
03:53:47.790 --> 03:53:47.800 align:start position:0%
logic and understanding to that and
 
03:53:49.710 --> 03:53:49.720 align:start position:0%
actually make a recommendation to you I
 
03:53:51.710 --> 03:53:51.720 align:start position:0%
probably would have made differently but
 
03:53:54.189 --> 03:53:54.199 align:start position:0%
um if you recall under HHR you have a
 
03:53:57.229 --> 03:53:57.239 align:start position:0%
25% tax rate that's the number under the
 
03:53:58.710 --> 03:53:58.720 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming commission we learn
 
03:54:00.309 --> 03:54:00.319 align:start position:0%
that the operational expense to the
 
03:54:03.550 --> 03:54:03.560 align:start position:0%
owners are between 12 and 18% of the ggr
 
03:54:06.349 --> 03:54:06.359 align:start position:0%
of the gross Gaming revenue so what I'd
 
03:54:07.750 --> 03:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
recommend is you split that difference
 
03:54:12.030 --> 03:54:12.040 align:start position:0%
and assume a 15% 12 18 middle is 15 and
 
03:54:15.309 --> 03:54:15.319 align:start position:0%
then split that Revenue so that the
 
03:54:16.990 --> 03:54:17.000 align:start position:0%
state will increase its tax rate from
 
03:54:21.149 --> 03:54:21.159 align:start position:0%
25% to 37 uh 32.5% that's a 7 1.5%
 
03:54:23.229 --> 03:54:23.239 align:start position:0%
increase the operators will also get a 7
 
03:54:26.950 --> 03:54:26.960 align:start position:0%
and a half% bump in um their their
 
03:54:28.630 --> 03:54:28.640 align:start position:0%
revenues so it splits the difference it
 
03:54:30.710 --> 03:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
takes what a current tax rate of 25 so
 
03:54:33.030 --> 03:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
it's not as painful to the operator the
 
03:54:35.469 --> 03:54:35.479 align:start position:0%
one thing I I'll say is as you and the
 
03:54:38.550 --> 03:54:38.560 align:start position:0%
reason why I'm I'm I'm recommending that
 
03:54:41.229 --> 03:54:41.239 align:start position:0%
is because I can go to Encore and I can
 
03:54:42.950 --> 03:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
bet 50 bucks and I can on a hand a
 
03:54:44.830 --> 03:54:44.840 align:start position:0%
blackjack and if I win I win 50 bucks
 
03:54:46.750 --> 03:54:46.760 align:start position:0%
and I can walk away I can go to any
 
03:54:47.950 --> 03:54:47.960 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming casino in New
 
03:54:49.790 --> 03:54:49.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I can bet 50 bucks and if I
 
03:54:52.110 --> 03:54:52.120 align:start position:0%
win I get 50 bucks back so you're not
 
03:54:54.070 --> 03:54:54.080 align:start position:0%
going to attract People based on just
 
03:54:56.189 --> 03:54:56.199 align:start position:0%
pure gaming right that's not the reason
 
03:54:58.510 --> 03:54:58.520 align:start position:0%
if I can go make $50 at encor I can go
 
03:55:00.550 --> 03:55:00.560 align:start position:0%
make $50 here in New Hampshire it's
 
03:55:01.910 --> 03:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
going to be what's closest and easiest
 
03:55:04.469 --> 03:55:04.479 align:start position:0%
to me where you will make the difference
 
03:55:07.469 --> 03:55:07.479 align:start position:0%
is the customer service experience right
 
03:55:09.269 --> 03:55:09.279 align:start position:0%
so by giving operators more money they
 
03:55:12.469 --> 03:55:12.479 align:start position:0%
make our casinos more fun for lack of a
 
03:55:14.630 --> 03:55:14.640 align:start position:0%
better phrase more staff more food and B
 
03:55:16.790 --> 03:55:16.800 align:start position:0%
more entertainment values more things so
 
03:55:18.469 --> 03:55:18.479 align:start position:0%
we want to come underneath the other
 
03:55:21.269 --> 03:55:21.279 align:start position:0%
states when it comes to our tax rate
 
03:55:23.149 --> 03:55:23.159 align:start position:0%
because we want to encourage our invest
 
03:55:25.189 --> 03:55:25.199 align:start position:0%
our our gaming operators to put money
 
03:55:26.670 --> 03:55:26.680 align:start position:0%
back into the facility to make it more
 
03:55:28.910 --> 03:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
fun so that guy who's in Boston instead
 
03:55:30.510 --> 03:55:30.520 align:start position:0%
of driving over to Encore if you've ever
 
03:55:31.950 --> 03:55:31.960 align:start position:0%
made that drive it's almost impossible
 
03:55:33.830 --> 03:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
to get there the way that that casino's
 
03:55:36.149 --> 03:55:36.159 align:start position:0%
off the interstate but it'll say I'm
 
03:55:37.389 --> 03:55:37.399 align:start position:0%
just going to drive up to Nashville I'm
 
03:55:38.750 --> 03:55:38.760 align:start position:0%
going to drive up to Salem and I'm going
 
03:55:40.389 --> 03:55:40.399 align:start position:0%
to I'm going a game and we'll bring more
 
03:55:43.110 --> 03:55:43.120 align:start position:0%
tax revenue from um the states of
 
03:55:45.070 --> 03:55:45.080 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and the state to main into
 
03:55:47.030 --> 03:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire because a our casinos will
 
03:55:48.910 --> 03:55:48.920 align:start position:0%
be nicer they'll be more fun they'll be
 
03:55:50.990 --> 03:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
more entertaining because the operators
 
03:55:52.429 --> 03:55:52.439 align:start position:0%
have the revenue they need the
 
03:55:54.269 --> 03:55:54.279 align:start position:0%
operational money to be able to make it
 
03:55:56.830 --> 03:55:56.840 align:start position:0%
better rather than just be the same as
 
03:55:59.469 --> 03:55:59.479 align:start position:0%
Encore so um so my recommendations is
 
03:56:00.830 --> 03:56:00.840 align:start position:0%
when you're thinking about this tax rate
 
03:56:04.110 --> 03:56:04.120 align:start position:0%
think about the um around 32 and a half%
 
03:56:05.830 --> 03:56:05.840 align:start position:0%
like I said the Senate passed 35 that
 
03:56:07.189 --> 03:56:07.199 align:start position:0%
was my negotiating position with the
 
03:56:09.070 --> 03:56:09.080 align:start position:0%
house because I know you passed 30 and I
 
03:56:11.070 --> 03:56:11.080 align:start position:0%
was hoping you meet me in the middle um
 
03:56:12.910 --> 03:56:12.920 align:start position:0%
at 32 and A2 if we went to committee a
 
03:56:15.189 --> 03:56:15.199 align:start position:0%
conference um but but as you're looking
 
03:56:17.950 --> 03:56:17.960 align:start position:0%
at hb2 I'd consider that understand it's
 
03:56:19.149 --> 03:56:19.159 align:start position:0%
going to have a major impact on the
 
03:56:21.189 --> 03:56:21.199 align:start position:0%
budget right if you drop the tax rate
 
03:56:25.149 --> 03:56:25.159 align:start position:0%
from 45% to 32 a. half% uh 12 a half%
 
03:56:27.590 --> 03:56:27.600 align:start position:0%
decrease in revenues um and so some of
 
03:56:28.670 --> 03:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
the other things are going to have to be
 
03:56:30.990 --> 03:56:31.000 align:start position:0%
looked at over in finance but as a but
 
03:56:33.469 --> 03:56:33.479 align:start position:0%
as a tax policy not looking at the
 
03:56:35.189 --> 03:56:35.199 align:start position:0%
spending side but just looking as a
 
03:56:37.510 --> 03:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
policy I'd encourage you to look around
 
03:56:41.030 --> 03:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
around 35 to 32 and a half% cuz uh the
 
03:56:43.110 --> 03:56:43.120 align:start position:0%
last again I think it's fair The
 
03:56:44.349 --> 03:56:44.359 align:start position:0%
Operators will make a little bit more
 
03:56:45.510 --> 03:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
the state will make a little bit more
 
03:56:46.630 --> 03:56:46.640 align:start position:0%
the Charities will make a little bit
 
03:56:47.990 --> 03:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
more everybody makes a little bit more
 
03:56:49.950 --> 03:56:49.960 align:start position:0%
money by going to 45 The Operators will
 
03:56:53.070 --> 03:56:53.080 align:start position:0%
actually lose money as compared to HHR
 
03:56:56.349 --> 03:56:56.359 align:start position:0%
um they'll they'll go from a 25 to a to
 
03:56:58.070 --> 03:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
a uh
 
03:57:00.590 --> 03:57:00.600 align:start position:0%
45% and if you assume that they're at
 
03:57:03.790 --> 03:57:03.800 align:start position:0%
the maximum at 18 um they're still going
 
03:57:06.670 --> 03:57:06.680 align:start position:0%
to lose 2% of Revenue every every uh
 
03:57:08.950 --> 03:57:08.960 align:start position:0%
year just by choosing to go to slots so
 
03:57:10.309 --> 03:57:10.319 align:start position:0%
no operator is going to want to do that
 
03:57:11.910 --> 03:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
so we have to think about the business
 
03:57:14.710 --> 03:57:14.720 align:start position:0%
side uh make sense um
 
03:57:16.550 --> 03:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
so I guess that was it I'm happy to take
 
03:57:18.469 --> 03:57:18.479 align:start position:0%
questions if you have any Revenue splits
 
03:57:20.309 --> 03:57:20.319 align:start position:0%
I'll leave to you I did mine differently
 
03:57:24.269 --> 03:57:24.279 align:start position:0%
I I I I did a 25 2550 I gave 25% to
 
03:57:26.110 --> 03:57:26.120 align:start position:0%
education I gave I created a new
 
03:57:28.750 --> 03:57:28.760 align:start position:0%
reimbursement fund for municipalities um
 
03:57:31.389 --> 03:57:31.399 align:start position:0%
to give 25% of Gaming revenue for slots
 
03:57:33.429 --> 03:57:33.439 align:start position:0%
to back to municipalities who give out
 
03:57:35.469 --> 03:57:35.479 align:start position:0%
the elderly tax credit because as you
 
03:57:37.229 --> 03:57:37.239 align:start position:0%
know when you give out a tax credit in
 
03:57:39.590 --> 03:57:39.600 align:start position:0%
the state every other property taxpayer
 
03:57:42.189 --> 03:57:42.199 align:start position:0%
picks up the cost of that tax credit um
 
03:57:44.710 --> 03:57:44.720 align:start position:0%
and so my idea was we could help local
 
03:57:46.269 --> 03:57:46.279 align:start position:0%
property taxes by reimbursing
 
03:57:47.790 --> 03:57:47.800 align:start position:0%
communities for these elderly tax
 
03:57:49.710 --> 03:57:49.720 align:start position:0%
credits they give and it would be a
 
03:57:51.349 --> 03:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
prorated amount based on how much is in
 
03:57:53.389 --> 03:57:53.399 align:start position:0%
the fund and then they give 50% to the
 
03:57:55.229 --> 03:57:55.239 align:start position:0%
general fund for whatever purposes the
 
03:57:57.189 --> 03:57:57.199 align:start position:0%
legislature deems
 
03:57:59.790 --> 03:57:59.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate questions for Senator Lang
 
03:58:00.950 --> 03:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
yes repr
 
03:58:04.030 --> 03:58:04.040 align:start position:0%
opal thank you Mr chairman um and thank
 
03:58:06.590 --> 03:58:06.600 align:start position:0%
you Senator
 
03:58:09.429 --> 03:58:09.439 align:start position:0%
um I don't remember the exact figures
 
03:58:11.429 --> 03:58:11.439 align:start position:0%
but as I recall from some previous
 
03:58:13.030 --> 03:58:13.040 align:start position:0%
information we received I believe from
 
03:58:14.830 --> 03:58:14.840 align:start position:0%
representative om
 
03:58:16.750 --> 03:58:16.760 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire already charges a
 
03:58:21.110 --> 03:58:21.120 align:start position:0%
significantly lower license fee than any
 
03:58:24.189 --> 03:58:24.199 align:start position:0%
of our surrounding states and as I
 
03:58:26.790 --> 03:58:26.800 align:start position:0%
remember help me remember but I think
 
03:58:28.990 --> 03:58:29.000 align:start position:0%
our fee is like
 
03:58:31.670 --> 03:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
$250 the the fees for our neighboring
 
03:58:34.990 --> 03:58:35.000 align:start position:0%
states are in the thousands if not tens
 
03:58:38.790 --> 03:58:38.800 align:start position:0%
of thousands if not more is that correct
 
03:58:40.469 --> 03:58:40.479 align:start position:0%
that's a true
 
03:58:43.110 --> 03:58:43.120 align:start position:0%
statement is that not already an
 
03:58:44.830 --> 03:58:44.840 align:start position:0%
attraction I know that not an attraction
 
03:58:45.750 --> 03:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
for the
 
03:58:49.030 --> 03:58:49.040 align:start position:0%
customer but correct in terms of in
 
03:58:51.750 --> 03:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
terms of operators I would think that
 
03:58:54.429 --> 03:58:54.439 align:start position:0%
would be a pretty strong incentive to
 
03:58:58.070 --> 03:58:58.080 align:start position:0%
build here or to to create casinos here
 
03:59:01.070 --> 03:59:01.080 align:start position:0%
as opposed to having to pay the
 
03:59:03.710 --> 03:59:03.720 align:start position:0%
Commonwealth sure so I I look at it this
 
03:59:05.710 --> 03:59:05.720 align:start position:0%
way one's a short-term fee right so you
 
03:59:07.670 --> 03:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
could you could charge you know big big
 
03:59:09.149 --> 03:59:09.159 align:start position:0%
upfront cost but in the end you're going
 
03:59:10.389 --> 03:59:10.399 align:start position:0%
to have to lower your tax rate because
 
03:59:11.429 --> 03:59:11.439 align:start position:0%
these guys still got to make a living
 
03:59:12.429 --> 03:59:12.439 align:start position:0%
and they going to have to pay off that
 
03:59:14.349 --> 03:59:14.359 align:start position:0%
they're going to take loans on that it's
 
03:59:15.910 --> 03:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
going to add into their operational
 
03:59:18.110 --> 03:59:18.120 align:start position:0%
expense operational expenses so you
 
03:59:19.990 --> 03:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
could charge a big fee and it it will
 
03:59:22.110 --> 03:59:22.120 align:start position:0%
create a barrier for people coming into
 
03:59:23.670 --> 03:59:23.680 align:start position:0%
the state to invest in this state to
 
03:59:25.070 --> 03:59:25.080 align:start position:0%
expand in this state especially if you
 
03:59:27.149 --> 03:59:27.159 align:start position:0%
do a variable size some states have
 
03:59:29.510 --> 03:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
variable size gaming licenses tiered
 
03:59:32.030 --> 03:59:32.040 align:start position:0%
tiered licenses they call them sometimes
 
03:59:33.710 --> 03:59:33.720 align:start position:0%
um but again that's going to be a
 
03:59:36.269 --> 03:59:36.279 align:start position:0%
barrier to entry into the state um so
 
03:59:37.950 --> 03:59:37.960 align:start position:0%
you could do that but I think it would
 
03:59:40.149 --> 03:59:40.159 align:start position:0%
it would actually hinder us more I I'm
 
03:59:41.510 --> 03:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
I'm more of a long-term player I'm going
 
03:59:43.429 --> 03:59:43.439 align:start position:0%
to look at a reasonable tax rate that
 
03:59:45.790 --> 03:59:45.800 align:start position:0%
will allow them to keep our our Gaming
 
03:59:49.229 --> 03:59:49.239 align:start position:0%
facilities fresh fun and operational by
 
03:59:51.149 --> 03:59:51.159 align:start position:0%
giving the operators a little more money
 
03:59:52.309 --> 03:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
um remember some of these gaming
 
03:59:54.550 --> 03:59:54.560 align:start position:0%
operators I was I was at the Nash opened
 
03:59:56.630 --> 03:59:56.640 align:start position:0%
up last week um and I went to their
 
03:59:59.389 --> 03:59:59.399 align:start position:0%
grand opening to to see it down in nsha
 
04:00:02.389 --> 04:00:02.399 align:start position:0%
um they have they have 600 employees
 
04:00:05.750 --> 04:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
about 350 to 400 a full-time right so
 
04:00:07.030 --> 04:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
these are adding I don't want to create
 
04:00:08.429 --> 04:00:08.439 align:start position:0%
barriers for people to come open up in
 
04:00:10.189 --> 04:00:10.199 align:start position:0%
our state if they're going to create you
 
04:00:13.229 --> 04:00:13.239 align:start position:0%
know 450 new jobs or you know 600 new
 
04:00:15.830 --> 04:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
jobs in our state so uh I'm not a big
 
04:00:18.590 --> 04:00:18.600 align:start position:0%
fan of of Entry fees I prefer to take a
 
04:00:22.030 --> 04:00:22.040 align:start position:0%
long-term look at it followup Mr chair
 
04:00:24.990 --> 04:00:25.000 align:start position:0%
all I guess I'm not thinking necessarily
 
04:00:26.149 --> 04:00:26.159 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
04:00:29.070 --> 04:00:29.080 align:start position:0%
matching um you talked about you know
 
04:00:33.710 --> 04:00:33.720 align:start position:0%
putting our our um tax rate beneath our
 
04:00:36.269 --> 04:00:36.279 align:start position:0%
neighbors um I'm just wondering seems
 
04:00:38.070 --> 04:00:38.080 align:start position:0%
like there may be some room to put our
 
04:00:40.149 --> 04:00:40.159 align:start position:0%
licensing fee beneath our neighbors as
 
04:00:42.710 --> 04:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
well let me ask you one other question
 
04:00:45.630 --> 04:00:45.640 align:start position:0%
um I I don't know whether
 
04:00:48.790 --> 04:00:48.800 align:start position:0%
hb2 I don't see an address in here but
 
04:00:51.830 --> 04:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm wondering about your thoughts
 
04:00:55.790 --> 04:00:55.800 align:start position:0%
on the transferability of these licenses
 
04:00:57.630 --> 04:00:57.640 align:start position:0%
once once you have a
 
04:01:00.590 --> 04:01:00.600 align:start position:0%
license if you sell the business do you
 
04:01:02.870 --> 04:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
sell the license as well thank you for
 
04:01:05.229 --> 04:01:05.239 align:start position:0%
the question so again um licenses are
 
04:01:07.229 --> 04:01:07.239 align:start position:0%
non-sellable you can only it's like any
 
04:01:08.750 --> 04:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
other business it's an asset of the
 
04:01:10.149 --> 04:01:10.159 align:start position:0%
business and if you sell your business
 
04:01:11.790 --> 04:01:11.800 align:start position:0%
the asset goes with the business but I
 
04:01:14.590 --> 04:01:14.600 align:start position:0%
can't sell that asset off on its own
 
04:01:17.429 --> 04:01:17.439 align:start position:0%
so I have to sell the entire
 
04:01:20.590 --> 04:01:20.600 align:start position:0%
business thank
 
04:01:23.070 --> 04:01:23.080 align:start position:0%
you anything
 
04:01:25.710 --> 04:01:25.720 align:start position:0%
else I don't see any thank you very much
 
04:01:29.790 --> 04:01:29.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:35.630 --> 04:01:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:39.389 --> 04:01:39.399 align:start position:0%
thoughts we have Dr uh we are on we're
 
04:01:41.110 --> 04:01:41.120 align:start position:0%
still on the VT section we're talking
 
04:01:54.110 --> 04:01:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:56.349 --> 04:01:56.359 align:start position:0%
yeah yes we are
 
04:02:01.510 --> 04:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
discussing uh on page 39 from line 20 to
 
04:02:04.030 --> 04:02:04.040 align:start position:0%
36 and well let me
 
04:02:04.040 --> 04:02:08.269 align:start position:0%
36 and well let me
see

04:02:08.269 --> 04:02:08.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:11.110 --> 04:02:11.120 align:start position:0%
um I don't think we have anything to say
 
04:02:19.630 --> 04:02:19.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:24.309 --> 04:02:24.319 align:start position:0%
yes I've just been looking at um section
 
04:02:28.710 --> 04:02:28.720 align:start position:0%
66 about the commission and the members
 
04:02:29.710 --> 04:02:29.720 align:start position:0%
I do
 
04:02:34.429 --> 04:02:34.439 align:start position:0%
see on line 31 that no member of the
 
04:02:36.309 --> 04:02:36.319 align:start position:0%
commission shall have any pecuniary or
 
04:02:40.309 --> 04:02:40.319 align:start position:0%
other interest Etc but there is no
 
04:02:43.110 --> 04:02:43.120 align:start position:0%
definition or no recommendation here as
 
04:02:46.070 --> 04:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
to who would be a member of this
 
04:02:48.110 --> 04:02:48.120 align:start position:0%
commission I understand it's the
 
04:02:50.429 --> 04:02:50.439 align:start position:0%
government the governor's
 
04:02:53.870 --> 04:02:53.880 align:start position:0%
decision but uh I would like to see some
 
04:02:56.550 --> 04:02:56.560 align:start position:0%
language in there at some point about
 
04:02:59.110 --> 04:02:59.120 align:start position:0%
who else might be on
 
04:03:06.030 --> 04:03:06.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:11.910 --> 04:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:14.269 --> 04:03:14.279 align:start position:0%
suggestion I do
 
04:03:17.910 --> 04:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
okay it could be one of two uh systems
 
04:03:20.830 --> 04:03:20.840 align:start position:0%
and in my thought and I agree that uh
 
04:03:22.710 --> 04:03:22.720 align:start position:0%
that's a kind of a b appointed by the
 
04:03:28.349 --> 04:03:28.359 align:start position:0%
governor that yeah we it's normal yeah
 
04:03:32.670 --> 04:03:32.680 align:start position:0%
that's true but uh um representative Aly
 
04:03:34.510 --> 04:03:34.520 align:start position:0%
is aware of some issues we had with the
 
04:03:36.510 --> 04:03:36.520 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission that was three
 
04:03:40.070 --> 04:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
members uh and it took U
 
04:03:44.750 --> 04:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
uh Bill to U Bill O'Brien um to break
 
04:03:48.790 --> 04:03:48.800 align:start position:0%
that down and change it over
 
04:03:52.469 --> 04:03:52.479 align:start position:0%
um three members one from the house one
 
04:03:54.110 --> 04:03:54.120 align:start position:0%
from the Senate one appointed by the
 
04:03:56.269 --> 04:03:56.279 align:start position:0%
governor makes
 
04:03:58.550 --> 04:03:58.560 align:start position:0%
sense if not
 
04:04:02.910 --> 04:04:02.920 align:start position:0%
that then establish a joint uh Committee
 
04:04:05.630 --> 04:04:05.640 align:start position:0%
of House and Senate Ways and Means as a
 
04:04:08.510 --> 04:04:08.520 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee uh to
 
04:04:11.469 --> 04:04:11.479 align:start position:0%
work and to oversee daily
 
04:04:14.429 --> 04:04:14.439 align:start position:0%
operations of uh well not daily
 
04:04:16.870 --> 04:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
operations but to to oversee the uh
 
04:04:21.870 --> 04:04:21.880 align:start position:0%
strategic analysis of uh uh of the the
 
04:04:25.070 --> 04:04:25.080 align:start position:0%
gaming in New Hampshire to give uh both
 
04:04:28.910 --> 04:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
uh the commissioner a bit of uh guidance
 
04:04:32.269 --> 04:04:32.279 align:start position:0%
and to uh make it more expeditious when
 
04:04:35.349 --> 04:04:35.359 align:start position:0%
it comes before the uh legislature with
 
04:04:37.349 --> 04:04:37.359 align:start position:0%
uh I want to sell
 
04:04:41.630 --> 04:04:41.640 align:start position:0%
a Min a trillion dollar coin as a former
 
04:04:44.429 --> 04:04:44.439 align:start position:0%
president once suggested to solve the uh
 
04:04:48.389 --> 04:04:48.399 align:start position:0%
deficit issue uh which never happened
 
04:04:51.229 --> 04:04:51.239 align:start position:0%
I'm just saying it would work a little
 
04:04:55.349 --> 04:04:55.359 align:start position:0%
bit smoother than it currently does with
 
04:04:58.030 --> 04:04:58.040 align:start position:0%
the commissioner and the Senate coming
 
04:05:00.389 --> 04:05:00.399 align:start position:0%
up with a 35 and he knows the house
 
04:05:03.070 --> 04:05:03.080 align:start position:0%
position is 30 and he's hoping to
 
04:05:05.229 --> 04:05:05.239 align:start position:0%
committee a conference just work it out
 
04:05:07.469 --> 04:05:07.479 align:start position:0%
ahead of time and get it done and that
 
04:05:09.309 --> 04:05:09.319 align:start position:0%
would be done through an oversight
 
04:05:13.269 --> 04:05:13.279 align:start position:0%
committee uh something of that nature Mr
 
04:05:16.710 --> 04:05:16.720 align:start position:0%
chair I think needs to be urged upon uh
 
04:05:18.550 --> 04:05:18.560 align:start position:0%
finance committee when they're talking
 
04:05:21.830 --> 04:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
about this for the uh efficient
 
04:05:25.790 --> 04:05:25.800 align:start position:0%
implementation of VI lottery in the
 
04:05:28.110 --> 04:05:28.120 align:start position:0%
state robone El
 
04:05:30.710 --> 04:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
me yes
 
04:05:35.550 --> 04:05:35.560 align:start position:0%
um first um just remember this is an
 
04:05:35.560 --> 04:05:37.429 align:start position:0%
um first um just remember this is an
existing

04:05:37.429 --> 04:05:37.439 align:start position:0%
existing
 
04:05:40.910 --> 04:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
statute to which is being added only and
 
04:05:44.349 --> 04:05:44.359 align:start position:0%
gaming and then at the bottom that the
 
04:05:46.149 --> 04:05:46.159 align:start position:0%
commission shall be properly addressed
 
04:05:48.229 --> 04:05:48.239 align:start position:0%
as the New Hampshire Lottery and gaming
 
04:05:51.950 --> 04:05:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:57.229 --> 04:05:57.239 align:start position:0%
um The Lottery Commission already
 
04:05:59.750 --> 04:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
has three
 
04:06:03.070 --> 04:06:03.080 align:start position:0%
Commissioners named by the governor at
 
04:06:03.080 --> 04:06:04.070 align:start position:0%
Commissioners named by the governor at
its

04:06:04.070 --> 04:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
its
 
04:06:07.229 --> 04:06:07.239 align:start position:0%
top who are
 
04:06:11.510 --> 04:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
overlooking our great long-term Lottery
 
04:06:14.189 --> 04:06:14.199 align:start position:0%
executive director
 
04:06:16.910 --> 04:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
who probably has more knowledge than
 
04:06:18.950 --> 04:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
they did
 
04:06:24.269 --> 04:06:24.279 align:start position:0%
do I'm not sure um and to add yet
 
04:06:26.990 --> 04:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
another group which is are they going to
 
04:06:29.229 --> 04:06:29.239 align:start position:0%
oversee the
 
04:06:31.990 --> 04:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
Commissioners that are legislators who
 
04:06:33.790 --> 04:06:33.800 align:start position:0%
may or may not
 
04:06:36.349 --> 04:06:36.359 align:start position:0%
continue this year next year the year
 
04:06:39.590 --> 04:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
after that or drop out to take a
 
04:06:43.070 --> 04:06:43.080 align:start position:0%
job yes because the legislature is the
 
04:06:46.830 --> 04:06:46.840 align:start position:0%
top dog not a commission which was a
 
04:06:49.830 --> 04:06:49.840 align:start position:0%
problem we had with uh several
 
04:06:52.309 --> 04:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
Commissions in the state and I again
 
04:06:54.590 --> 04:06:54.600 align:start position:0%
mention the issues we had had in the
 
04:06:57.710 --> 04:06:57.720 align:start position:0%
past and you know you had a uh liquor
 
04:06:59.790 --> 04:06:59.800 align:start position:0%
Commissioners under the three that just
 
04:07:01.349 --> 04:07:01.359 align:start position:0%
said we're not going to tell you
 
04:07:04.309 --> 04:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
anything we don't report to you well he
 
04:07:06.229 --> 04:07:06.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't tell us some things either he
 
04:07:08.269 --> 04:07:08.279 align:start position:0%
says it's a contract and we can't find
 
04:07:12.510 --> 04:07:12.520 align:start position:0%
out so well anyway um
 
04:07:16.990 --> 04:07:17.000 align:start position:0%
but but I do think it's a lot of
 
04:07:17.000 --> 04:07:18.590 align:start position:0%
but but I do think it's a lot of
unnecessary

04:07:18.590 --> 04:07:18.600 align:start position:0%
unnecessary
 
04:07:21.189 --> 04:07:21.199 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy especially considering that
 
04:07:24.229 --> 04:07:24.239 align:start position:0%
all of us are on twoyear
 
04:07:27.590 --> 04:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
terms which is a good thing which is a
 
04:07:27.600 --> 04:07:28.630 align:start position:0%
terms which is a good thing which is a
good

04:07:28.630 --> 04:07:28.640 align:start position:0%
good
 
04:07:31.710 --> 04:07:31.720 align:start position:0%
thing but I mean is this really a a a
 
04:07:34.950 --> 04:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
new commission or is it just because the
 
04:07:37.070 --> 04:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
the bold face is and gaming so there's
 
04:07:39.349 --> 04:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
already a state Lottery Commission is it
 
04:07:44.990 --> 04:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:47.710 --> 04:07:47.720 align:start position:0%
yeah yes okay that that's the commission
 
04:07:49.990 --> 04:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
that oversees the day-to-day operations
 
04:07:52.149 --> 04:07:52.159 align:start position:0%
more or less month-to month operations
 
04:07:54.670 --> 04:07:54.680 align:start position:0%
but we're not creating a another another
 
04:07:56.710 --> 04:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
commission no it would not be a
 
04:07:59.189 --> 04:07:59.199 align:start position:0%
commission of that but uh if you grant
 
04:08:04.070 --> 04:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
Jud uh judicial if you grant legislative
 
04:08:06.389 --> 04:08:06.399 align:start position:0%
oversight to a body then you you have a
 
04:08:09.389 --> 04:08:09.399 align:start position:0%
body already existing to help modify
 
04:08:11.670 --> 04:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
this as we go through the birthing uh
 
04:08:13.950 --> 04:08:13.960 align:start position:0%
Pains of establishing
 
04:08:16.990 --> 04:08:17.000 align:start position:0%
uh BLTs and uh
 
04:08:20.790 --> 04:08:20.800 align:start position:0%
um modifying uh whatever else comes
 
04:08:22.830 --> 04:08:22.840 align:start position:0%
whatever else come yeah thank you
 
04:08:22.840 --> 04:08:23.990 align:start position:0%
whatever else come yeah thank you
representative

04:08:23.990 --> 04:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:08:26.670 --> 04:08:26.680 align:start position:0%
shamberg representative ol could you
 
04:08:30.030 --> 04:08:30.040 align:start position:0%
simplify this for me okay it says a
 
04:08:31.630 --> 04:08:31.640 align:start position:0%
gaming Commission of three members you
 
04:08:34.030 --> 04:08:34.040 align:start position:0%
stated one would be appointed by the
 
04:08:37.950 --> 04:08:37.960 align:start position:0%
house one by the Senate one by the
 
04:08:39.910 --> 04:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
governor I just want to make sure I'm
 
04:08:43.229 --> 04:08:43.239 align:start position:0%
hearing this go on sir yes I'll that
 
04:08:46.269 --> 04:08:46.279 align:start position:0%
would be one thing to add into this okay
 
04:08:48.750 --> 04:08:48.760 align:start position:0%
you it would be one thing to add to this
 
04:08:51.550 --> 04:08:51.560 align:start position:0%
because when I read the rest of it the
 
04:08:54.910 --> 04:08:54.920 align:start position:0%
governor can remove by cause I go she
 
04:08:56.670 --> 04:08:56.680 align:start position:0%
the governor would be overruling
 
04:08:59.030 --> 04:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
whatever the house decides or the Senate
 
04:09:01.790 --> 04:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
decides who that person shall be but you
 
04:09:04.309 --> 04:09:04.319 align:start position:0%
you most Commissioners uh in the state
 
04:09:06.830 --> 04:09:06.840 align:start position:0%
are removed only by
 
04:09:10.550 --> 04:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
cause uh like safety commissioner and
 
04:09:13.109 --> 04:09:13.119 align:start position:0%
except if you're dick Flynn and you know
 
04:09:16.469 --> 04:09:16.479 align:start position:0%
where all the never mind uh but if you
 
04:09:20.590 --> 04:09:20.600 align:start position:0%
were appointed if you were appointed and
 
04:09:22.590 --> 04:09:22.600 align:start position:0%
the governor wanted to remove you would
 
04:09:22.600 --> 04:09:23.510 align:start position:0%
the governor wanted to remove you would
that

04:09:23.510 --> 04:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:09:27.710 --> 04:09:27.720 align:start position:0%
be interference by another uh Department
 
04:09:29.750 --> 04:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
of the government yeah I think it might
 
04:09:32.590 --> 04:09:32.600 align:start position:0%
be did it that way we could do it okay
 
04:09:35.469 --> 04:09:35.479 align:start position:0%
but I'm I'm saying we could do it which
 
04:09:38.670 --> 04:09:38.680 align:start position:0%
is why probably go to legislative
 
04:09:41.149 --> 04:09:41.159 align:start position:0%
oversight because that puts us in a
 
04:09:43.950 --> 04:09:43.960 align:start position:0%
position of making a referral
 
04:09:43.960 --> 04:09:46.590 align:start position:0%
position of making a referral
thank

04:09:46.590 --> 04:09:46.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:50.349 --> 04:09:50.359 align:start position:0%
you representative elberger thank you Mr
 
04:09:52.990 --> 04:09:53.000 align:start position:0%
chairman can we find out who the
 
04:09:54.710 --> 04:09:54.720 align:start position:0%
Commissioners are not necessarily their
 
04:09:57.469 --> 04:09:57.479 align:start position:0%
names but their backgrounds and that
 
04:10:02.950 --> 04:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:06.149 --> 04:10:06.159 align:start position:0%
information and how often they show up
 
04:10:09.429 --> 04:10:09.439 align:start position:0%
pardon how often they show up uh it
 
04:10:11.030 --> 04:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
varies um I've had a number of
 
04:10:12.389 --> 04:10:12.399 align:start position:0%
Commissioners in the past generally they
 
04:10:14.309 --> 04:10:14.319 align:start position:0%
have business backgrounds uh the current
 
04:10:16.590 --> 04:10:16.600 align:start position:0%
three commission members are Deborah
 
04:10:19.309 --> 04:10:19.319 align:start position:0%
Douglas who lives in BO um business
 
04:10:22.070 --> 04:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
background she was a account person with
 
04:10:22.080 --> 04:10:22.950 align:start position:0%
background she was a account person with
Marl

04:10:22.950 --> 04:10:22.960 align:start position:0%
Marl
 
04:10:26.790 --> 04:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
Lynch um Andy Cruz who you may know is a
 
04:10:29.750 --> 04:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
former principal at AutoFair uh and a
 
04:10:32.149 --> 04:10:32.159 align:start position:0%
number of other businesses and Earl
 
04:10:33.990 --> 04:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
Pierce who are members of this body
 
04:10:36.550 --> 04:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
probably know well he was a um
 
04:10:39.710 --> 04:10:39.720 align:start position:0%
government relations expert with Telecom
 
04:10:41.950 --> 04:10:41.960 align:start position:0%
um it's mostly been business the
 
04:10:45.269 --> 04:10:45.279 align:start position:0%
governor uh Appo points generally would
 
04:10:46.990 --> 04:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
the governor will call and ask if that's
 
04:10:48.870 --> 04:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
okay he's asking permission he just
 
04:10:49.990 --> 04:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
wants to make sure that we can work
 
04:10:51.830 --> 04:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
together and I've never said no
 
04:10:53.469 --> 04:10:53.479 align:start position:0%
obviously I've been fortunate I have
 
04:10:55.030 --> 04:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
wonderful commission members appointed
 
04:10:56.309 --> 04:10:56.319 align:start position:0%
by the governor and then they're
 
04:11:03.309 --> 04:11:03.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:05.910 --> 04:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
04:11:08.349 --> 04:11:08.359 align:start position:0%
opal thank you Mr chairman actually this
 
04:11:11.189 --> 04:11:11.199 align:start position:0%
is for representative erery um I'm just
 
04:11:13.309 --> 04:11:13.319 align:start position:0%
trying to understand representative are
 
04:11:15.630 --> 04:11:15.640 align:start position:0%
you talking about legislative oversight
 
04:11:18.830 --> 04:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
as opposed to having the speaker appoint
 
04:11:20.349 --> 04:11:20.359 align:start position:0%
one member and the Senate President
 
04:11:22.670 --> 04:11:22.680 align:start position:0%
appoint one member is that yes as
 
04:11:25.830 --> 04:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
opposed to that okay yes it would uh it
 
04:11:28.510 --> 04:11:28.520 align:start position:0%
would be more clear that they can do
 
04:11:31.510 --> 04:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
whatever they want but the ultimate
 
04:11:34.469 --> 04:11:34.479 align:start position:0%
power for the the operations the
 
04:11:36.950 --> 04:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
oversight would remain General
 
04:11:39.269 --> 04:11:39.279 align:start position:0%
Court in this side of the house thank
 
04:11:42.189 --> 04:11:42.199 align:start position:0%
you remember the governor occupies the
 
04:11:46.429 --> 04:11:46.439 align:start position:0%
office in in the the uh uh State House
 
04:11:48.950 --> 04:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
on our permission there's a reason we
 
04:11:50.950 --> 04:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
have an executive councel still to this
 
04:11:54.389 --> 04:11:54.399 align:start position:0%
day as well so that's yes that's true
 
04:11:56.189 --> 04:11:56.199 align:start position:0%
too and trying to explain that to
 
04:12:00.469 --> 04:12:00.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:04.229 --> 04:12:04.239 align:start position:0%
yes rosan Murphy thank you Mr chairman I
 
04:12:07.030 --> 04:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
had a couple of um I guess comments on
 
04:12:10.149 --> 04:12:10.159 align:start position:0%
this one is that you know um Senator
 
04:12:11.710 --> 04:12:11.720 align:start position:0%
Lang had mentioned that they were going
 
04:12:13.710 --> 04:12:13.720 align:start position:0%
to try and or he was recommend dividing
 
04:12:16.550 --> 04:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
the revenue 25% to the education trust
 
04:12:20.030 --> 04:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
fund 25% to municipalities and 50% to
 
04:12:21.670 --> 04:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
the general fund but I don't see
 
04:12:24.510 --> 04:12:24.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities mentioned in where
 
04:12:26.189 --> 04:12:26.199 align:start position:0%
they're talking about dividing the
 
04:12:30.229 --> 04:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
revenue so so we also we had a public
 
04:12:32.710 --> 04:12:32.720 align:start position:0%
hearing this morning on HB
 
04:12:37.630 --> 04:12:37.640 align:start position:0%
728 okay uh and that is a potential area
 
04:12:40.830 --> 04:12:40.840 align:start position:0%
where um he I talked to Senator Lang at
 
04:12:43.389 --> 04:12:43.399 align:start position:0%
lunch and he there's a bill coming
 
04:12:45.389 --> 04:12:45.399 align:start position:0%
through the Senate that is very very
 
04:12:46.429 --> 04:12:46.439 align:start position:0%
similar to
 
04:12:49.590 --> 04:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
728 um but there's a couple differences
 
04:12:52.469 --> 04:12:52.479 align:start position:0%
one is it talks about those splits so we
 
04:12:56.550 --> 04:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
could put those splits in 728 if we want
 
04:12:57.990 --> 04:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
um because keep in mind everything
 
04:13:01.750 --> 04:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be an hp2 hb2 may you
 
04:13:05.910 --> 04:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
know outline a few things it may not
 
04:13:07.950 --> 04:13:07.960 align:start position:0%
describe everything that's why these
 
04:13:09.269 --> 04:13:09.279 align:start position:0%
these other bills like
 
04:13:14.109 --> 04:13:14.119 align:start position:0%
728 uh have the although that has to be
 
04:13:16.309 --> 04:13:16.319 align:start position:0%
that has to be out of our committee by
 
04:13:20.670 --> 04:13:20.680 align:start position:0%
the end of next week so um we may not be
 
04:13:22.229 --> 04:13:22.239 align:start position:0%
able we may or may not be able to get
 
04:13:24.550 --> 04:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
that all figured out uh but there
 
04:13:28.229 --> 04:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
there's that um the 30 the 35% he was
 
04:13:31.910 --> 04:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
talking about is in his bill um the 30%
 
04:13:34.750 --> 04:13:34.760 align:start position:0%
is in 728 right now okay so that those
 
04:13:36.030 --> 04:13:36.040 align:start position:0%
are the sorts of things and I think
 
04:13:37.750 --> 04:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
there was one other difference but those
 
04:13:38.910 --> 04:13:38.920 align:start position:0%
are the sorts of things that we can
 
04:13:40.590 --> 04:13:40.600 align:start position:0%
Define there as well we don't have to
 
04:13:42.750 --> 04:13:42.760 align:start position:0%
figure out everything within here could
 
04:13:44.710 --> 04:13:44.720 align:start position:0%
I have followup please sure uh thank you
 
04:13:47.109 --> 04:13:47.119 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um the other concern I have
 
04:13:49.109 --> 04:13:49.119 align:start position:0%
is that it's my understanding that the
 
04:13:51.429 --> 04:13:51.439 align:start position:0%
teachers pensions do not have colas
 
04:13:54.429 --> 04:13:54.439 align:start position:0%
currently and so my recommendation would
 
04:13:56.910 --> 04:13:56.920 align:start position:0%
be rather than funding the department of
 
04:13:59.990 --> 04:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
safety with any surplus that we um
 
04:14:02.309 --> 04:14:02.319 align:start position:0%
improve the disparity between the
 
04:14:03.710 --> 04:14:03.720 align:start position:0%
pensions that the teachers are getting
 
04:14:05.670 --> 04:14:05.680 align:start position:0%
and the pensions that other government
 
04:14:07.590 --> 04:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
employees are getting because it's
 
04:14:11.269 --> 04:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
really getting to be pretty pretty wide
 
04:14:13.189 --> 04:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
that's is that a f that's more of a
 
04:14:20.550 --> 04:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:23.109 --> 04:14:23.119 align:start position:0%
not yeah well that is on the first page
 
04:14:25.389 --> 04:14:25.399 align:start position:0%
I mean where you going to put the money
 
04:14:28.189 --> 04:14:28.199 align:start position:0%
okay well I
 
04:14:31.510 --> 04:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
that's we're spitballing right now so
 
04:14:36.070 --> 04:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah represent me I'd like to I'd
 
04:14:39.710 --> 04:14:39.720 align:start position:0%
like to spitball back then because I
 
04:14:42.550 --> 04:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
think that we can exercise legislative
 
04:14:45.070 --> 04:14:45.080 align:start position:0%
oversight it by a full committee that
 
04:14:50.469 --> 04:14:50.479 align:start position:0%
includes a range of people from from uh
 
04:14:53.229 --> 04:14:53.239 align:start position:0%
and in public uh that includes a bunch
 
04:14:56.309 --> 04:14:56.319 align:start position:0%
of people from different walks of life
 
04:14:58.269 --> 04:14:58.279 align:start position:0%
and and different
 
04:15:00.670 --> 04:15:00.680 align:start position:0%
interests uh whereas if we have a
 
04:15:03.510 --> 04:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
threepers oversight committee the rest
 
04:15:05.990 --> 04:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
of us have no idea what's going on and
 
04:15:08.830 --> 04:15:08.840 align:start position:0%
no say in it oh no I I tend to agree
 
04:15:10.790 --> 04:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
with you I don't I'm not limiting this
 
04:15:13.830 --> 04:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
to three people uh my proposal it could
 
04:15:16.710 --> 04:15:16.720 align:start position:0%
be a joint committee uh between uh House
 
04:15:19.149 --> 04:15:19.159 align:start position:0%
and Senate ways and means our meeting
 
04:15:20.950 --> 04:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
joint session or something all you need
 
04:15:26.030 --> 04:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
to do is designate and or lot in law the
 
04:15:28.670 --> 04:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
ability to do that that's the only thing
 
04:15:32.950 --> 04:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
I would require how you know U having a
 
04:15:35.870 --> 04:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
public is is was one of the reasons for
 
04:15:38.910 --> 04:15:38.920 align:start position:0%
it uh because we are dealing with the
 
04:15:42.030 --> 04:15:42.040 align:start position:0%
so-called syntax type situation and
 
04:15:43.550 --> 04:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
because we have some EXP parents with
 
04:15:51.429 --> 04:15:51.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:55.269 --> 04:15:55.279 align:start position:0%
so did I'm just I don't want to have
 
04:15:57.790 --> 04:15:57.800 align:start position:0%
what happened happen
 
04:16:00.309 --> 04:16:00.319 align:start position:0%
again so I mean right now there is a
 
04:16:02.830 --> 04:16:02.840 align:start position:0%
three-person commission how's that how's
 
04:16:07.189 --> 04:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
that been working out I mean well in 10
 
04:16:09.510 --> 04:16:09.520 align:start position:0%
years we've tripled revenue from 60 60
 
04:16:11.910 --> 04:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
some million to 207 million so I think
 
04:16:14.189 --> 04:16:14.199 align:start position:0%
well and there was a certainly a
 
04:16:16.870 --> 04:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
discussion back in 2015 when we absorbed
 
04:16:18.830 --> 04:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
the racing and charitable gaming
 
04:16:21.309 --> 04:16:21.319 align:start position:0%
commission and they had six members and
 
04:16:22.750 --> 04:16:22.760 align:start position:0%
they all wanted to join us and have a
 
04:16:25.349 --> 04:16:25.359 align:start position:0%
nine member commission to which I
 
04:16:27.229 --> 04:16:27.239 align:start position:0%
thought that would be
 
04:16:29.510 --> 04:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
unwieldy nine commission members is
 
04:16:30.590 --> 04:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
difficult to answer to you spend a lot
 
04:16:31.990 --> 04:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
of time on the phone just answering
 
04:16:34.870 --> 04:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
questions and letters and emails it's um
 
04:16:36.910 --> 04:16:36.920 align:start position:0%
the larger certainly in my experience
 
04:16:39.670 --> 04:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
nationally Lottery commissions that are
 
04:16:41.349 --> 04:16:41.359 align:start position:0%
two dozen three dozen members gets very
 
04:16:43.550 --> 04:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
unwieldy in terms of operations
 
04:16:49.670 --> 04:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:52.389 --> 04:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
okay I mean I just to be clear I mean
 
04:16:55.790 --> 04:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm assuming this is the same this
 
04:16:57.550 --> 04:16:57.560 align:start position:0%
is the same commission it's just that
 
04:16:59.990 --> 04:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's being called
 
04:17:02.670 --> 04:17:02.680 align:start position:0%
Theiss sorry they're just amending the
 
04:17:05.030 --> 04:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
the change in the title of the just
 
04:17:07.269 --> 04:17:07.279 align:start position:0%
adding gaming this this commission's
 
04:17:10.389 --> 04:17:10.399 align:start position:0%
existed for many many years I you know
 
04:17:12.229 --> 04:17:12.239 align:start position:0%
it's it's a recognition of the fact that
 
04:17:14.510 --> 04:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
the whole game industry is changing
 
04:17:14.520 --> 04:17:16.469 align:start position:0%
the whole game industry is changing
rapidly

04:17:16.469 --> 04:17:16.479 align:start position:0%
rapidly
 
04:17:19.149 --> 04:17:19.159 align:start position:0%
okay yeah it shouldn't instead of
 
04:17:20.910 --> 04:17:20.920 align:start position:0%
addressed if it was if we were in
 
04:17:23.469 --> 04:17:23.479 align:start position:0%
England it would be called
 
04:17:27.550 --> 04:17:27.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:30.790 --> 04:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
title okay
 
04:17:34.229 --> 04:17:34.239 align:start position:0%
sure uh yes Brier sorry I didn't mean to
 
04:17:37.870 --> 04:17:37.880 align:start position:0%
interrupt uh m is a clarification I
 
04:17:40.030 --> 04:17:40.040 align:start position:0%
think if I'm just asking for a
 
04:17:41.910 --> 04:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
clarification is what we're discussing
 
04:17:44.830 --> 04:17:44.840 align:start position:0%
now is we have an existing commission
 
04:17:46.870 --> 04:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
that already exists are we talking about
 
04:17:49.229 --> 04:17:49.239 align:start position:0%
amending that commission to enlarge it
 
04:17:52.149 --> 04:17:52.159 align:start position:0%
and include legislative members just
 
04:17:54.469 --> 04:17:54.479 align:start position:0%
from my understanding well we're we're
 
04:17:56.590 --> 04:17:56.600 align:start position:0%
just throwing throwing out ideas I don't
 
04:17:58.630 --> 04:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
know and that's why I just asked how's
 
04:18:00.149 --> 04:18:00.159 align:start position:0%
the three- member commission working it
 
04:18:02.670 --> 04:18:02.680 align:start position:0%
sounds like it's working fine at the at
 
04:18:05.229 --> 04:18:05.239 align:start position:0%
the current moment so I would if
 
04:18:07.990 --> 04:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
something's working follow up is broken
 
04:18:09.830 --> 04:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
I I also believe that the commission
 
04:18:12.830 --> 04:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
members make about between 10 and 15,000
 
04:18:15.309 --> 04:18:15.319 align:start position:0%
in a year right the two commission
 
04:18:17.070 --> 04:18:17.080 align:start position:0%
members make 10 a year and the chairman
 
04:18:22.109 --> 04:18:22.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:25.950 --> 04:18:25.960 align:start position:0%
yeah any other anything else um any
 
04:18:28.870 --> 04:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
other comments on page
 
04:18:32.469 --> 04:18:32.479 align:start position:0%
39 I mean right right now I I I took
 
04:18:35.189 --> 04:18:35.199 align:start position:0%
three notes I guess one is there's a
 
04:18:36.590 --> 04:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
suggestion for
 
04:18:40.750 --> 04:18:40.760 align:start position:0%
opin or opt out opt-in opt out language
 
04:18:43.429 --> 04:18:43.439 align:start position:0%
uh number two was to cross out the word
 
04:18:45.469 --> 04:18:45.479 align:start position:0%
Governor um because this is coming from
 
04:18:48.269 --> 04:18:48.279 align:start position:0%
the house on line 20 and then the third
 
04:18:48.279 --> 04:18:49.510 align:start position:0%
the house on line 20 and then the third
suggestion

04:18:49.510 --> 04:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
suggestion
 
04:18:49.520 --> 04:18:51.990 align:start position:0%
suggestion
was

04:18:51.990 --> 04:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:18:55.510 --> 04:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
um oh well I guess the the How would how
 
04:18:57.229 --> 04:18:57.239 align:start position:0%
are these chosen now these three members
 
04:18:58.510 --> 04:18:58.520 align:start position:0%
of the commission is the governor
 
04:19:01.389 --> 04:19:01.399 align:start position:0%
chooses them yes the resume submitted to
 
04:19:03.469 --> 04:19:03.479 align:start position:0%
the governor uh resume submitted to the
 
04:19:05.189 --> 04:19:05.199 align:start position:0%
governor governor chooses and then
 
04:19:07.349 --> 04:19:07.359 align:start position:0%
appointed and then confirmation proces
 
04:19:10.269 --> 04:19:10.279 align:start position:0%
executive counsel okay so do we I guess
 
04:19:12.189 --> 04:19:12.199 align:start position:0%
I'm not clear on that did we want that
 
04:19:15.149 --> 04:19:15.159 align:start position:0%
to change to represent UL suggestion of
 
04:19:17.590 --> 04:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
one from the
 
04:19:21.670 --> 04:19:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:26.070 --> 04:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
add somewhere above or to the side
 
04:19:30.750 --> 04:19:30.760 align:start position:0%
of the side of to the side of yeah if
 
04:19:30.760 --> 04:19:32.070 align:start position:0%
of the side of to the side of yeah if
you

04:19:32.070 --> 04:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:19:35.429 --> 04:19:35.439 align:start position:0%
if if we don't say that the
 
04:19:38.830 --> 04:19:38.840 align:start position:0%
legislature can look
 
04:19:43.910 --> 04:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
at either liquor or or um
 
04:19:43.920 --> 04:19:47.189 align:start position:0%
at either liquor or or um
gaming

04:19:47.189 --> 04:19:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:50.229 --> 04:19:50.239 align:start position:0%
then experience up here has taught me
 
04:19:52.189 --> 04:19:52.199 align:start position:0%
that one of the
 
04:19:55.229 --> 04:19:55.239 align:start position:0%
agencies may just get their hackles up
 
04:19:58.070 --> 04:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
and tell you to go
 
04:20:01.229 --> 04:20:01.239 align:start position:0%
away not necessarily current current
 
04:20:05.070 --> 04:20:05.080 align:start position:0%
Personnel not entitled I believe there's
 
04:20:07.149 --> 04:20:07.159 align:start position:0%
a bill pending for another study
 
04:20:10.229 --> 04:20:10.239 align:start position:0%
commission um and it's legislatively
 
04:20:12.109 --> 04:20:12.119 align:start position:0%
populated didn't know if you could add
 
04:20:14.429 --> 04:20:14.439 align:start position:0%
that to that
 
04:20:17.030 --> 04:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
yeah added to that um group because it
 
04:20:19.070 --> 04:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
is a legislative body I'm a member but
 
04:20:21.149 --> 04:20:21.159 align:start position:0%
I'm not voting right so and as you
 
04:20:22.389 --> 04:20:22.399 align:start position:0%
remember from the study commission you
 
04:20:24.790 --> 04:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
were on Mr chairman you know we staff it
 
04:20:26.269 --> 04:20:26.279 align:start position:0%
and we're responsible for it and we
 
04:20:28.469 --> 04:20:28.479 align:start position:0%
answer to it so it's not as if um would
 
04:20:30.510 --> 04:20:30.520 align:start position:0%
be you'd be creating a third commission
 
04:20:31.990 --> 04:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
something that in
 
04:20:34.710 --> 04:20:34.720 align:start position:0%
that yeah well we may I guess the point
 
04:20:37.389 --> 04:20:37.399 align:start position:0%
being we may not need to create another
 
04:20:40.070 --> 04:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
um no but if if because that that that
 
04:20:42.750 --> 04:20:42.760 align:start position:0%
commission does uh look at all these
 
04:20:45.710 --> 04:20:45.720 align:start position:0%
things and if we give that commission
 
04:20:49.710 --> 04:20:49.720 align:start position:0%
legislative authority to be an oversight
 
04:20:51.990 --> 04:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
commission just what the Lang language
 
04:20:55.750 --> 04:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
of a legislative oversight shall reside
 
04:20:58.429 --> 04:20:58.439 align:start position:0%
in you're not creating anything other
 
04:21:00.189 --> 04:21:00.199 align:start position:0%
than what we're already
 
04:21:04.710 --> 04:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:04.720 --> 04:21:06.429 align:start position:0%
 
section

04:21:06.429 --> 04:21:06.439 align:start position:0%
section
 
04:21:08.550 --> 04:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
yes I don't know if that already passed
 
04:21:13.710 --> 04:21:13.720 align:start position:0%
or not we already have the authority
 
04:21:15.469 --> 04:21:15.479 align:start position:0%
to look
 
04:21:20.710 --> 04:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
at uh anything any group that is is
 
04:21:24.750 --> 04:21:24.760 align:start position:0%
raising money for us once every two
 
04:21:28.309 --> 04:21:28.319 align:start position:0%
years you have the authority to call us
 
04:21:31.229 --> 04:21:31.239 align:start position:0%
back if you see anything or someone else
 
04:21:33.510 --> 04:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
comes to you saying they've seen
 
04:21:36.189 --> 04:21:36.199 align:start position:0%
something uh
 
04:21:40.990 --> 04:21:41.000 align:start position:0%
and and have a meeting with the
 
04:21:43.990 --> 04:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
executive director or I oppose the
 
04:21:46.309 --> 04:21:46.319 align:start position:0%
Commissioners I don't know whether we've
 
04:21:48.389 --> 04:21:48.399 align:start position:0%
never seen the Commissioners
 
04:21:53.990 --> 04:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
so uh whether they'd get upset but um
 
04:21:56.510 --> 04:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
and that allows the entire
 
04:21:56.520 --> 04:21:58.429 align:start position:0%
and that allows the entire
committee

04:21:58.429 --> 04:21:58.439 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:22:01.269 --> 04:22:01.279 align:start position:0%
to which represents lots of different
 
04:22:07.189 --> 04:22:07.199 align:start position:0%
interests to see and and discuss this we
 
04:22:09.189 --> 04:22:09.199 align:start position:0%
can get to the point where you say
 
04:22:10.830 --> 04:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
that's the contract we are allowed to
 
04:22:13.670 --> 04:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
show you which is frustrating from my
 
04:22:13.680 --> 04:22:14.790 align:start position:0%
show you which is frustrating from my
side

04:22:14.790 --> 04:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
side
 
04:22:20.269 --> 04:22:20.279 align:start position:0%
but uh but that's something we'd get to
 
04:22:22.550 --> 04:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
with anyone I
 
04:22:24.990 --> 04:22:25.000 align:start position:0%
think uh and I don't know that
 
04:22:27.149 --> 04:22:27.159 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight would allow us to
 
04:22:29.870 --> 04:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
break contract
 
04:22:32.590 --> 04:22:32.600 align:start position:0%
confidentiality no probably not but it
 
04:22:34.710 --> 04:22:34.720 align:start position:0%
would only be three
 
04:22:39.149 --> 04:22:39.159 align:start position:0%
people or five people or whatever no I
 
04:22:43.630 --> 04:22:43.640 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm suggesting that in some fashion
 
04:22:48.469 --> 04:22:48.479 align:start position:0%
we document or place in Granite that the
 
04:22:50.710 --> 04:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
legislature has
 
04:22:50.720 --> 04:22:52.269 align:start position:0%
legislature has
oversight

04:22:52.269 --> 04:22:52.279 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
04:22:57.870 --> 04:22:57.880 align:start position:0%
period and this is just one way to do it
 
04:22:59.990 --> 04:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
um I
 
04:23:02.389 --> 04:23:02.399 align:start position:0%
would make that recommendation to
 
04:23:04.910 --> 04:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
finance we have the commit uh commission
 
04:23:07.670 --> 04:23:07.680 align:start position:0%
that is being established I think it
 
04:23:09.030 --> 04:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
already passed the
 
04:23:12.790 --> 04:23:12.800 align:start position:0%
house uh and we could of course modify
 
04:23:15.630 --> 04:23:15.640 align:start position:0%
like we do all the time in the trailer
 
04:23:19.189 --> 04:23:19.199 align:start position:0%
bill yeah uh just a simple sentence of
 
04:23:22.349 --> 04:23:22.359 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight shall
 
04:23:25.030 --> 04:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
reside I
 
04:23:28.630 --> 04:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
I just history
 
04:23:31.550 --> 04:23:31.560 align:start position:0%
has okay I I remember the frustration
 
04:23:34.590 --> 04:23:34.600 align:start position:0%
both you and and Norm had with with
 
04:23:37.870 --> 04:23:37.880 align:start position:0%
individuals and and I I felt it as
 
04:23:40.870 --> 04:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
well but for whatever reason and it was
 
04:23:43.469 --> 04:23:43.479 align:start position:0%
bad enough that well you know they took
 
04:23:45.790 --> 04:23:45.800 align:start position:0%
that special commission that bill set up
 
04:23:47.269 --> 04:23:47.279 align:start position:0%
and I sat on
 
04:23:49.510 --> 04:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
04:23:53.670 --> 04:23:53.680 align:start position:0%
Opel i u i I hate to disagree with
 
04:23:55.349 --> 04:23:55.359 align:start position:0%
representative ol because under normal
 
04:23:58.469 --> 04:23:58.479 align:start position:0%
circumstances I I I am all in favor of
 
04:24:00.990 --> 04:24:01.000 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight for example I'd
 
04:24:02.590 --> 04:24:02.600 align:start position:0%
love a little more legislative oversight
 
04:24:04.790 --> 04:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
over efas but
 
04:24:08.550 --> 04:24:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:13.429 --> 04:24:13.439 align:start position:0%
more I I did I did um thanks to my
 
04:24:18.189 --> 04:24:18.199 align:start position:0%
colleague um but and i' I've lost where
 
04:24:21.510 --> 04:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
this has gone but is there not uh a
 
04:24:25.309 --> 04:24:25.319 align:start position:0%
either a new rule or or something
 
04:24:27.429 --> 04:24:27.439 align:start position:0%
regarding the ability of the legislature
 
04:24:30.070 --> 04:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
through the speaker to subpoena and
 
04:24:32.590 --> 04:24:32.600 align:start position:0%
would that not provide the kind of I
 
04:24:34.870 --> 04:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
mean if if if an agency is going to wave
 
04:24:38.670 --> 04:24:38.680 align:start position:0%
us off it seems to me that that you know
 
04:24:40.149 --> 04:24:40.159 align:start position:0%
one way to one way to deal with that is
 
04:24:42.750 --> 04:24:42.760 align:start position:0%
to go to the speaker and say
 
04:24:46.109 --> 04:24:46.119 align:start position:0%
um but like I say I'm I'm generally all
 
04:24:48.109 --> 04:24:48.119 align:start position:0%
in favor of legislative
 
04:24:48.119 --> 04:24:51.149 align:start position:0%
in favor of legislative
oversight

04:24:51.149 --> 04:24:51.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:54.870 --> 04:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
yes you're absolutely correct if we had
 
04:24:54.880 --> 04:24:57.469 align:start position:0%
yes you're absolutely correct if we had
authority

04:24:57.469 --> 04:24:57.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:01.510 --> 04:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
to so you're proposing Authority in hb2
 
04:25:03.750 --> 04:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
right okay representative Aly I'm
 
04:25:07.389 --> 04:25:07.399 align:start position:0%
wondering if our researcher has any
 
04:25:07.399 --> 04:25:09.149 align:start position:0%
wondering if our researcher has any
idea

04:25:09.149 --> 04:25:09.159 align:start position:0%
idea
 
04:25:12.309 --> 04:25:12.319 align:start position:0%
uh what we would need to do if any
 
04:25:16.469 --> 04:25:16.479 align:start position:0%
anything to create this concept which I
 
04:25:18.830 --> 04:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
thought already existed of
 
04:25:26.990 --> 04:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:29.990 --> 04:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
oversight up to
 
04:25:30.000 --> 04:25:32.070 align:start position:0%
oversight up to
you

04:25:32.070 --> 04:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:25:34.309 --> 04:25:34.319 align:start position:0%
different ways in other committees
 
04:25:39.830 --> 04:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:42.870 --> 04:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
commission UC
 
04:25:47.830 --> 04:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
committee also um so having that within
 
04:25:56.910 --> 04:25:56.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:00.469 --> 04:26:00.479 align:start position:0%
Unusual issues that followview i' have
 
04:26:02.990 --> 04:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
to look up yourit rulle to see exactly
 
04:26:05.830 --> 04:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
how that spelled out but um it's
 
04:26:08.109 --> 04:26:08.119 align:start position:0%
certainly you certainly have precedent
 
04:26:11.030 --> 04:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
for that kind of activity if you're
 
04:26:14.710 --> 04:26:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:17.750 --> 04:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
Comm representative Southworth uh thank
 
04:26:20.149 --> 04:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question it's more of
 
04:26:23.149 --> 04:26:23.159 align:start position:0%
a comment but um I'm just thinking can
 
04:26:27.269 --> 04:26:27.279 align:start position:0%
we refer um this section 66 this issue
 
04:26:30.309 --> 04:26:30.319 align:start position:0%
maybe one of the leaders a two Pats
 
04:26:33.269 --> 04:26:33.279 align:start position:0%
committee so that they be thinking about
 
04:26:35.550 --> 04:26:35.560 align:start position:0%
this as well I know they already have a
 
04:26:38.630 --> 04:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
list but um there seems to be the way
 
04:26:41.109 --> 04:26:41.119 align:start position:0%
we're discussing it a way we may be able
 
04:26:42.950 --> 04:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
to use that committee to to solve this
 
04:26:42.960 --> 04:26:44.030 align:start position:0%
to use that committee to to solve this
problem

04:26:44.030 --> 04:26:44.040 align:start position:0%
problem
 
04:26:46.109 --> 04:26:46.119 align:start position:0%
commission it's confusing because this
 
04:26:48.469 --> 04:26:48.479 align:start position:0%
is has the word Commission in it too but
 
04:26:50.950 --> 04:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
it's a different commission that might
 
04:26:52.950 --> 04:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
be able to tie up some loose
 
04:26:55.429 --> 04:26:55.439 align:start position:0%
ense but someone needs to let Patrick
 
04:26:58.469 --> 04:26:58.479 align:start position:0%
know so well okay first off he's not the
 
04:27:01.429 --> 04:27:01.439 align:start position:0%
chair right now right U the new the new
 
04:27:02.830 --> 04:27:02.840 align:start position:0%
commission needs to get started and
 
04:27:05.429 --> 04:27:05.439 align:start position:0%
they'll appoint a chair maybe him again
 
04:27:07.309 --> 04:27:07.319 align:start position:0%
uh but right now yeah but because it's
 
04:27:09.550 --> 04:27:09.560 align:start position:0%
in limbo I'd suggest him but whatever
 
04:27:11.990 --> 04:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah okay yeah I mean that that's
 
04:27:14.750 --> 04:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
that that's um certainly another
 
04:27:16.389 --> 04:27:16.399 align:start position:0%
possibility here is that commission
 
04:27:19.309 --> 04:27:19.319 align:start position:0%
which is made up of legislators Senators
 
04:27:21.429 --> 04:27:21.439 align:start position:0%
house members and members of the public
 
04:27:24.710 --> 04:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
but um and director
 
04:27:28.189 --> 04:27:28.199 align:start position:0%
McIntyre um the AG's office but there
 
04:27:30.590 --> 04:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
you and the AG's office are non- voting
 
04:27:34.349 --> 04:27:34.359 align:start position:0%
members uh we also had uh Al no you
 
04:27:36.830 --> 04:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
weren't on the no I remember you're
 
04:27:38.910 --> 04:27:38.920 align:start position:0%
sitting in the audience
 
04:27:44.189 --> 04:27:44.199 align:start position:0%
though um so yes that that that
 
04:27:47.349 --> 04:27:47.359 align:start position:0%
commission could study what
 
04:27:49.910 --> 04:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
um yeah what should be done in this
 
04:27:51.510 --> 04:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
regard because they'll already have more
 
04:27:53.030 --> 04:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
information about some of these things
 
04:27:55.990 --> 04:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
we're bouncing around as part of their
 
04:27:59.550 --> 04:27:59.560 align:start position:0%
charge of what works and what doesn't
 
04:27:59.560 --> 04:28:02.070 align:start position:0%
charge of what works and what doesn't
work

04:28:02.070 --> 04:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
work
 
04:28:05.670 --> 04:28:05.680 align:start position:0%
yeah um like I so we're not making we're
 
04:28:09.070 --> 04:28:09.080 align:start position:0%
not writing the law we're just making
 
04:28:12.469 --> 04:28:12.479 align:start position:0%
recommendations yeah well we can make
 
04:28:14.990 --> 04:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
can right we're we're right we're not
 
04:28:16.830 --> 04:28:16.840 align:start position:0%
going to necessarily vote on I'm just
 
04:28:18.590 --> 04:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
trying to get a consensus of what we
 
04:28:19.950 --> 04:28:19.960 align:start position:0%
think here we're not going to vote on
 
04:28:21.670 --> 04:28:21.680 align:start position:0%
this we're not going to submit it well
 
04:28:23.389 --> 04:28:23.399 align:start position:0%
we're going to submit our thoughts or
 
04:28:26.590 --> 04:28:26.600 align:start position:0%
I'll submit our thoughts to um to
 
04:28:28.469 --> 04:28:28.479 align:start position:0%
finance and say Here's how we'd like to
 
04:28:31.030 --> 04:28:31.040 align:start position:0%
see this change and we'd like to see to
 
04:28:34.189 --> 04:28:34.199 align:start position:0%
represent ul's Point um some sort of
 
04:28:34.199 --> 04:28:35.910 align:start position:0%
represent ul's Point um some sort of
oversight

04:28:35.910 --> 04:28:35.920 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
04:28:35.920 --> 04:28:37.710 align:start position:0%
oversight
um

04:28:37.710 --> 04:28:37.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:40.550 --> 04:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
yes light put your light on please
 
04:28:43.790 --> 04:28:43.800 align:start position:0%
listen this conversation uh I it would
 
04:28:46.070 --> 04:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
proably we already I I think we have the
 
04:28:47.950 --> 04:28:47.960 align:start position:0%
mechanism in place with that commission
 
04:28:49.910 --> 04:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
that we talked about that we passed out
 
04:28:53.550 --> 04:28:53.560 align:start position:0%
of here and pass the floor yeah um maybe
 
04:28:55.710 --> 04:28:55.720 align:start position:0%
that through this we could tweak that to
 
04:28:59.510 --> 04:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh have some oversight Authority um to
 
04:29:01.510 --> 04:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
address the concerns that are coming up
 
04:29:05.550 --> 04:29:05.560 align:start position:0%
in this uh discussion also uh I believe
 
04:29:08.070 --> 04:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
that the LBA has a performance audit
 
04:29:11.149 --> 04:29:11.159 align:start position:0%
section and a financial section that can
 
04:29:13.229 --> 04:29:13.239 align:start position:0%
come in and look at the these operations
 
04:29:15.109 --> 04:29:15.119 align:start position:0%
that and they can look at any contract
 
04:29:17.950 --> 04:29:17.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:20.389 --> 04:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
statute yeah I'm not sure that we'd put
 
04:29:23.070 --> 04:29:23.080 align:start position:0%
the commission uh charitable Gaming
 
04:29:27.109 --> 04:29:27.119 align:start position:0%
Commission in in this area only because
 
04:29:29.070 --> 04:29:29.080 align:start position:0%
I mean someone can certainly disagree
 
04:29:32.389 --> 04:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
with me but this is
 
04:29:32.399 --> 04:29:35.710 align:start position:0%
with me but this is
more

04:29:35.710 --> 04:29:35.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:38.469 --> 04:29:38.479 align:start position:0%
um if I'm I don't know it just it
 
04:29:40.950 --> 04:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't feel yeah it doesn't feel LBA
 
04:29:42.790 --> 04:29:42.800 align:start position:0%
audit team is in my building six months
 
04:29:46.070 --> 04:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
a year and so they create the management
 
04:29:47.830 --> 04:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
letter for our annual report and then we
 
04:29:50.269 --> 04:29:50.279 align:start position:0%
produce annual report with the findings
 
04:29:52.830 --> 04:29:52.840 align:start position:0%
actually it's this month so we're the
 
04:29:57.469 --> 04:29:57.479 align:start position:0%
most audited agency in the state by LBA
 
04:30:03.229 --> 04:30:03.239 align:start position:0%
okay um yes represen elberger than
 
04:30:06.830 --> 04:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
opal I I wanted to get back to revenue
 
04:30:08.830 --> 04:30:08.840 align:start position:0%
okay unless you want to stay with this
 
04:30:09.990 --> 04:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
no I I was just about to say I think
 
04:30:11.590 --> 04:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
we're done with this page but represent
 
04:30:11.600 --> 04:30:12.750 align:start position:0%
we're done with this page but represent
opal

04:30:12.750 --> 04:30:12.760 align:start position:0%
opal
 
04:30:15.670 --> 04:30:15.680 align:start position:0%
no I I just um was going to before we
 
04:30:17.750 --> 04:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
finish Mr chair if you could just sort
 
04:30:17.760 --> 04:30:18.469 align:start position:0%
finish Mr chair if you could just sort
of

04:30:18.469 --> 04:30:18.479 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:30:21.269 --> 04:30:21.279 align:start position:0%
review what you what you would include
 
04:30:24.910 --> 04:30:24.920 align:start position:0%
in the the list of of things I missed I
 
04:30:26.830 --> 04:30:26.840 align:start position:0%
missed part of that list okay so for
 
04:30:26.840 --> 04:30:27.910 align:start position:0%
missed part of that list okay so for
page

04:30:27.910 --> 04:30:27.920 align:start position:0%
page
 
04:30:30.790 --> 04:30:30.800 align:start position:0%
39 the it's the last half of page 39 is
 
04:30:33.710 --> 04:30:33.720 align:start position:0%
what we've been talking about um the S
 
04:30:34.870 --> 04:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to suggest that they be
 
04:30:40.550 --> 04:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:43.309 --> 04:30:43.319 align:start position:0%
VT um
 
04:30:46.309 --> 04:30:46.319 align:start position:0%
laws um we were going to suggest that we
 
04:30:47.750 --> 04:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
cross out the word Governor here which
 
04:30:49.590 --> 04:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
I'm sure they'll catch anyhow but we'll
 
04:30:53.109 --> 04:30:53.119 align:start position:0%
make that suggestion on line 20 and the
 
04:30:55.870 --> 04:30:55.880 align:start position:0%
third suggestion on this page was that
 
04:30:58.990 --> 04:30:59.000 align:start position:0%
some legislative oversight be uh put
 
04:30:59.000 --> 04:31:00.630 align:start position:0%
some legislative oversight be uh put
into

04:31:00.630 --> 04:31:00.640 align:start position:0%
into
 
04:31:03.750 --> 04:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
the the language of this
 
04:31:06.469 --> 04:31:06.479 align:start position:0%
commission thank you so that's that's
 
04:31:08.750 --> 04:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
all I had for that is everyone okay with
 
04:31:12.910 --> 04:31:12.920 align:start position:0%
that okay I'm coming sorry sorry yeah Mr
 
04:31:14.870 --> 04:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
chairman I'm I'm just com circling back
 
04:31:17.349 --> 04:31:17.359 align:start position:0%
again to them specifying so I looked at
 
04:31:21.189 --> 04:31:21.199 align:start position:0%
that 728 bill that this refers to and
 
04:31:22.910 --> 04:31:22.920 align:start position:0%
it's kind of confusing because the
 
04:31:25.389 --> 04:31:25.399 align:start position:0%
allocations are different like between
 
04:31:27.189 --> 04:31:27.199 align:start position:0%
the two bills they're not you know
 
04:31:29.830 --> 04:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang presented one set of
 
04:31:31.870 --> 04:31:31.880 align:start position:0%
allocations in percentages and then if
 
04:31:34.389 --> 04:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
you look at 728 it's a different
 
04:31:37.630 --> 04:31:37.640 align:start position:0%
allocation so I'm not clear on what's
 
04:31:39.269 --> 04:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
going to actually pass into law if you
 
04:31:41.269 --> 04:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
know what I mean so so that's yeah
 
04:31:43.550 --> 04:31:43.560 align:start position:0%
that's um so basically what happens is
 
04:31:46.109 --> 04:31:46.119 align:start position:0%
that's outside of this particular thing
 
04:31:48.469 --> 04:31:48.479 align:start position:0%
but what Senator Lang is talking about I
 
04:31:49.670 --> 04:31:49.680 align:start position:0%
don't know the number of the bill he was
 
04:31:50.990 --> 04:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
talking about but that'll go through the
 
04:31:52.590 --> 04:31:52.600 align:start position:0%
Senate if it passes it'll come to the
 
04:31:55.710 --> 04:31:55.720 align:start position:0%
house we'll most likely get it here um
 
04:31:55.720 --> 04:31:57.910 align:start position:0%
house we'll most likely get it here um
if

04:31:57.910 --> 04:31:57.920 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:32:02.070 --> 04:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
um if we change so for an example if we
 
04:32:04.149 --> 04:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
change something in that Senate bill or
 
04:32:06.469 --> 04:32:06.479 align:start position:0%
we pass 728 and they change something in
 
04:32:08.910 --> 04:32:08.920 align:start position:0%
the house bill uh there ends up being a
 
04:32:10.590 --> 04:32:10.600 align:start position:0%
committee of conference between the two
 
04:32:12.590 --> 04:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
bodies to come to agreement on
 
04:32:14.030 --> 04:32:14.040 align:start position:0%
what well sometimes they don't come to
 
04:32:16.910 --> 04:32:16.920 align:start position:0%
agreement but if they do then then great
 
04:32:20.229 --> 04:32:20.239 align:start position:0%
so we don't we don't really what he was
 
04:32:20.239 --> 04:32:21.030 align:start position:0%
so we don't we don't really what he was
talking

04:32:21.030 --> 04:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
talking
 
04:32:23.189 --> 04:32:23.199 align:start position:0%
about doesn't really matter too much of
 
04:32:25.429 --> 04:32:25.439 align:start position:0%
what we're looking at right now because
 
04:32:28.030 --> 04:32:28.040 align:start position:0%
we're just looking at the language here
 
04:32:31.109 --> 04:32:31.119 align:start position:0%
in hb2 and what we would change or add
 
04:32:31.119 --> 04:32:32.269 align:start position:0%
in hb2 and what we would change or add
if

04:32:32.269 --> 04:32:32.279 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:32:36.070 --> 04:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
any follow so just quickly like so again
 
04:32:38.910 --> 04:32:38.920 align:start position:0%
my comment on you know the funding the
 
04:32:41.149 --> 04:32:41.159 align:start position:0%
department of safety on line 24 versus
 
04:32:43.349 --> 04:32:43.359 align:start position:0%
leaving that to the discretion of the
 
04:32:46.950 --> 04:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
group or improving the disparity between
 
04:32:48.710 --> 04:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
the teachers pensions that you know
 
04:32:50.149 --> 04:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
because they're having Recruitment and
 
04:32:51.910 --> 04:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
Retention problems too particularly in
 
04:32:54.189 --> 04:32:54.199 align:start position:0%
special ed which is a mandate it's a
 
04:32:56.670 --> 04:32:56.680 align:start position:0%
federal mandate so I think that you know
 
04:32:59.429 --> 04:32:59.439 align:start position:0%
we need to do something to like improve
 
04:33:01.590 --> 04:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
the situation there because it's
 
04:33:04.390 --> 04:33:04.400 align:start position:0%
creating a lot of um you know
 
04:33:06.310 --> 04:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
dissatisfaction if you will that I'm
 
04:33:08.670 --> 04:33:08.680 align:start position:0%
getting feedback from like constituents
 
04:33:11.510 --> 04:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
on so I'm just concerned that okay then
 
04:33:13.510 --> 04:33:13.520 align:start position:0%
you like to change that to I'd like to
 
04:33:15.429 --> 04:33:15.439 align:start position:0%
fund a cola for the teachers pensions
 
04:33:17.629 --> 04:33:17.639 align:start position:0%
because they don't have one right now so
 
04:33:19.070 --> 04:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
and with the inflation that we've been
 
04:33:20.789 --> 04:33:20.799 align:start position:0%
experiencing you know in the last
 
04:33:22.789 --> 04:33:22.799 align:start position:0%
several years it's a big concern not
 
04:33:25.990 --> 04:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
fund but contribute contribute to yes
 
04:33:29.670 --> 04:33:29.680 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so I guess how would we word
 
04:33:31.150 --> 04:33:31.160 align:start position:0%
that if people are in agreement do we
 
04:33:33.349 --> 04:33:33.359 align:start position:0%
say funding the department of safety
 
04:33:35.990 --> 04:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
equal equal amount well do they figure
 
04:33:37.910 --> 04:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
out would fin Finance would figure out
 
04:33:40.349 --> 04:33:40.359 align:start position:0%
what that funding balance is we're just
 
04:33:43.230 --> 04:33:43.240 align:start position:0%
suggesting that you also fund
 
04:33:45.990 --> 04:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
the that's all okay so so we say
 
04:33:47.750 --> 04:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety
 
04:33:50.869 --> 04:33:50.879 align:start position:0%
comma uh what is it again Cola or
 
04:33:54.830 --> 04:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
contributing to uh teachers col yeah
 
04:33:56.830 --> 04:33:56.840 align:start position:0%
they don't get one so I think we should
 
04:33:58.750 --> 04:33:58.760 align:start position:0%
um to their pension system or something
 
04:34:01.789 --> 04:34:01.799 align:start position:0%
to just improve the you know like I said
 
04:34:03.590 --> 04:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
they the the two pensions keep going
 
04:34:05.310 --> 04:34:05.320 align:start position:0%
further and further apart in terms of
 
04:34:07.830 --> 04:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
equity and so I think we we're going to
 
04:34:10.310 --> 04:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
exacerbate a perception on the part of
 
04:34:11.709 --> 04:34:11.719 align:start position:0%
the teachers that they're being
 
04:34:13.750 --> 04:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
mistreated by the state and I don't want
 
04:34:15.551 --> 04:34:15.561 align:start position:0%
to see that happen especially the
 
04:34:17.390 --> 04:34:17.400 align:start position:0%
special Educators because we just can't
 
04:34:18.990 --> 04:34:19.000 align:start position:0%
get enough do we what do we call them
 
04:34:20.349 --> 04:34:20.359 align:start position:0%
though is it just the blank word
 
04:34:25.230 --> 04:34:25.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:28.830 --> 04:34:28.840 align:start position:0%
pension okay yes it' be group one then
 
04:34:35.029 --> 04:34:35.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:38.470 --> 04:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
yeah okay raised separately by the
 
04:34:41.269 --> 04:34:41.279 align:start position:0%
governor every now and then but the
 
04:34:41.279 --> 04:34:42.830 align:start position:0%
governor every now and then but the
teachers

04:34:42.830 --> 04:34:42.840 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
04:34:44.429 --> 04:34:44.439 align:start position:0%
okay so I'm going to put comma
 
04:34:46.910 --> 04:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
contributing to group one teachers what
 
04:34:50.310 --> 04:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
cola or no teach one group one
 
04:34:53.349 --> 04:34:53.359 align:start position:0%
teachers okay retir
 
04:34:53.359 --> 04:34:55.510 align:start position:0%
teachers okay retir
retirement

04:34:55.510 --> 04:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
retirement
 
04:35:00.629 --> 04:35:00.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:05.189 --> 04:35:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:08.390 --> 04:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
that okay let's let's uh move on to uh
 
04:35:08.400 --> 04:35:09.230 align:start position:0%
that okay let's let's uh move on to uh
page

04:35:09.230 --> 04:35:09.240 align:start position:0%
page
 
04:35:12.189 --> 04:35:12.199 align:start position:0%
40 all right Mr chairman yeah yes I
 
04:35:14.709 --> 04:35:14.719 align:start position:0%
wanted to get back to finance to revenue
 
04:35:19.310 --> 04:35:19.320 align:start position:0%
though for just a moment um yeah sure um
 
04:35:22.990 --> 04:35:23.000 align:start position:0%
I I am really hopeful that your
 
04:35:25.670 --> 04:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
estimates about the revenue that will be
 
04:35:29.510 --> 04:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
generated by VTS are under estimates
 
04:35:29.520 --> 04:35:30.789 align:start position:0%
generated by VTS are under estimates
quite

04:35:30.789 --> 04:35:30.799 align:start position:0%
quite
 
04:35:33.510 --> 04:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
honestly I'm not sure what happens on
 
04:35:36.551 --> 04:35:36.561 align:start position:0%
the off chance that they are not that
 
04:35:39.990 --> 04:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
the revenue that is projected to be
 
04:35:43.150 --> 04:35:43.160 align:start position:0%
generated by the VTS will make up for
 
04:35:47.070 --> 04:35:47.080 align:start position:0%
the loss of basically $95
 
04:35:51.029 --> 04:35:51.039 align:start position:0%
million to the education trust fund and
 
04:35:54.670 --> 04:35:54.680 align:start position:0%
I I'm not sure where or
 
04:35:57.230 --> 04:35:57.240 align:start position:0%
how but I would like to figure out a way
 
04:36:00.310 --> 04:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
to have a um representative we're we're
 
04:36:02.429 --> 04:36:02.439 align:start position:0%
on on page 39 there's nothing about that
 
04:36:03.869 --> 04:36:03.879 align:start position:0%
is that somewhere else no that's why I
 
04:36:06.230 --> 04:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
said I wanted to get back to it I asked
 
04:36:08.150 --> 04:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
the commissioner
 
04:36:12.709 --> 04:36:12.719 align:start position:0%
about the estimates that we have from Dr
 
04:36:17.750 --> 04:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
yeah about revenue and on the last page
 
04:36:20.429 --> 04:36:20.439 align:start position:0%
the chart indicates that the education
 
04:36:24.670 --> 04:36:24.680 align:start position:0%
trust fund will be uh the funding will
 
04:36:30.629 --> 04:36:30.639 align:start position:0%
be reduced by 94.9 million because of uh
 
04:36:34.189 --> 04:36:34.199 align:start position:0%
changes in distributions from BET let's
 
04:36:36.150 --> 04:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
get on the same page so where so you're
 
04:36:38.830 --> 04:36:38.840 align:start position:0%
looking at the Dr handout the Dr handout
 
04:36:41.789 --> 04:36:41.799 align:start position:0%
the last page the last page
 
04:36:43.990 --> 04:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
and where we on the last page you oh the
 
04:36:47.990 --> 04:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
94.9 million yes
 
04:36:48.000 --> 04:36:53.510 align:start position:0%
94.9 million yes
okay

04:36:53.510 --> 04:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:58.390 --> 04:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
uh okay what's causing the uh now if you
 
04:37:00.949 --> 04:37:00.959 align:start position:0%
go back to page one it talks about
 
04:37:03.830 --> 04:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
changes in distribution from the
 
04:37:05.709 --> 04:37:05.719 align:start position:0%
business profit tax the business
 
04:37:08.670 --> 04:37:08.680 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax the tobacco tax and the r
 
04:37:10.470 --> 04:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
oh okay I think this is because the
 
04:37:12.470 --> 04:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
governor yeah we haven't gotten to this
 
04:37:14.429 --> 04:37:14.439 align:start position:0%
section yet the section you're talking
 
04:37:16.390 --> 04:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
about is where the percentage goes from
 
04:37:19.349 --> 04:37:19.359 align:start position:0%
41% to 34% correct so we're getting to
 
04:37:20.470 --> 04:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
that we haven't gotten to that yet all
 
04:37:22.470 --> 04:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
right at some I'd like to just sort of
 
04:37:25.429 --> 04:37:25.439 align:start position:0%
put a a placeholder in yeah that when it
 
04:37:27.349 --> 04:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
gets to that point that we need to
 
04:37:31.590 --> 04:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
consider what happens if the additional
 
04:37:34.670 --> 04:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
projected Revenue isn't there and there
 
04:37:37.551 --> 04:37:37.561 align:start position:0%
is this law a potential loss yes to the
 
04:37:41.230 --> 04:37:41.240 align:start position:0%
education trust represent elme yes I
 
04:37:45.551 --> 04:37:45.561 align:start position:0%
just just like to point out that on when
 
04:37:47.709 --> 04:37:47.719 align:start position:0%
the budget comes out it will have
 
04:37:53.070 --> 04:37:53.080 align:start position:0%
specific numbers for everything in it uh
 
04:37:56.551 --> 04:37:56.561 align:start position:0%
if the revenues do not cover that which
 
04:37:59.150 --> 04:37:59.160 align:start position:0%
they did not during the four years that
 
04:38:03.390 --> 04:38:03.400 align:start position:0%
I was first chair of ways and means on
 
04:38:06.990 --> 04:38:07.000 align:start position:0%
then in the second year we did another
 
04:38:10.070 --> 04:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
budget in the third year we did the
 
04:38:12.189 --> 04:38:12.199 align:start position:0%
normal budget in the fourth year we did
 
04:38:15.709 --> 04:38:15.719 align:start position:0%
another budget because the recession
 
04:38:17.789 --> 04:38:17.799 align:start position:0%
kept on getting
 
04:38:20.949 --> 04:38:20.959 align:start position:0%
worse it would go up a little in anyway
 
04:38:25.949 --> 04:38:25.959 align:start position:0%
well that and that's why and when uh
 
04:38:29.269 --> 04:38:29.279 align:start position:0%
when that happens the legislature the
 
04:38:33.070 --> 04:38:33.080 align:start position:0%
finance committee has to come back and
 
04:38:36.269 --> 04:38:36.279 align:start position:0%
figure out where it is cutting and if
 
04:38:38.590 --> 04:38:38.600 align:start position:0%
there's any place that we could raise
 
04:38:40.910 --> 04:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
some Revenue that everybody would agree
 
04:38:40.920 --> 04:38:42.429 align:start position:0%
some Revenue that everybody would agree
to

04:38:42.429 --> 04:38:42.439 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:38:45.590 --> 04:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
which is also very hard
 
04:38:49.590 --> 04:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
okay to uh let's go to page
 
04:38:56.230 --> 04:38:56.240 align:start position:0%
40 so page 40 the first half of page
 
04:39:01.070 --> 04:39:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:04.269 --> 04:39:04.279 align:start position:0%
definitions yeah definition wager games
 
04:39:04.279 --> 04:39:07.390 align:start position:0%
definitions yeah definition wager games
of

04:39:07.390 --> 04:39:07.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:11.390 --> 04:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
chance let's just make this line 12 and
 
04:39:17.349 --> 04:39:17.359 align:start position:0%
13 just m it's yeah
 
04:39:22.869 --> 04:39:22.879 align:start position:0%
Power well let's ask about that so um on
 
04:39:24.590 --> 04:39:24.600 align:start position:0%
page four do you do you have this you
 
04:39:27.869 --> 04:39:27.879 align:start position:0%
have this right so page 40 uh line 12
 
04:39:30.429 --> 04:39:30.439 align:start position:0%
and 13 what is that obviously it's about
 
04:39:32.349 --> 04:39:32.359 align:start position:0%
licensing but I mean
 
04:39:32.359 --> 04:39:39.230 align:start position:0%
licensing but I mean
what

04:39:39.230 --> 04:39:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:41.150 --> 04:39:41.160 align:start position:0%
you I'm just verifying that you're
 
04:39:41.160 --> 04:39:47.030 align:start position:0%
you I'm just verifying that you're
correct

04:39:47.030 --> 04:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:47.040 --> 04:39:49.230 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:39:49.230 --> 04:39:49.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:53.270 --> 04:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
us surveillance appr by
 
04:39:53.280 --> 04:39:55.270 align:start position:0%
us surveillance appr by
us

04:39:55.270 --> 04:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
us
 
04:39:57.628 --> 04:39:57.638 align:start position:0%
okay okay thank
 
04:40:00.868 --> 04:40:00.878 align:start position:0%
you okay so it's in the second let's
 
04:40:02.350 --> 04:40:02.360 align:start position:0%
look at the second half un let's does
 
04:40:03.708 --> 04:40:03.718 align:start position:0%
anyone have any questions on the first
 
04:40:05.350 --> 04:40:05.360 align:start position:0%
half of that
 
04:40:08.430 --> 04:40:08.440 align:start position:0%
page okay second half starts with
 
04:40:12.750 --> 04:40:12.760 align:start position:0%
chapter 287 J video Lottery ter
 
04:40:12.760 --> 04:40:17.990 align:start position:0%
chapter 287 J video Lottery ter
terminals

04:40:17.990 --> 04:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:20.390 --> 04:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
definitions I guess well actually this
 
04:40:22.670 --> 04:40:22.680 align:start position:0%
that's all that's all definitions yeah
 
04:40:22.680 --> 04:40:23.948 align:start position:0%
that's all that's all definitions yeah
does

04:40:23.948 --> 04:40:23.958 align:start position:0%
does
 
04:40:29.590 --> 04:40:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:33.910 --> 04:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:41.510 --> 04:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:43.510 --> 04:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
I I when I looked at this weekend I
 
04:40:47.230 --> 04:40:47.240 align:start position:0%
underlined at line 20 to be eligible for
 
04:40:49.070 --> 04:40:49.080 align:start position:0%
vl2 license the
 
04:40:51.030 --> 04:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
applicant must have been licensed or
 
04:40:52.750 --> 04:40:52.760 align:start position:0%
eligible for license sh to sell par
 
04:40:52.760 --> 04:40:53.830 align:start position:0%
eligible for license sh to sell par
Mutual

04:40:53.830 --> 04:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
Mutual
 
04:40:57.750 --> 04:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
pools oh yeah so I guess my question is
 
04:41:00.230 --> 04:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
there so the only way you can get a VT
 
04:41:05.990 --> 04:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:08.590 --> 04:41:08.600 align:start position:0%
license okay
 
04:41:13.510 --> 04:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
right represent elme so so they sorry
 
04:41:33.150 --> 04:41:33.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:36.030 --> 04:41:36.040 align:start position:0%
line so that number is finite at this
 
04:41:38.510 --> 04:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
point that it's not open-ended anymore
 
04:41:41.270 --> 04:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
no okay would there be a point where you
 
04:41:43.510 --> 04:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
would like to uh let us know how many
 
04:41:45.750 --> 04:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
are in that
 
04:41:49.830 --> 04:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
queue certainly it's because like I said
 
04:41:54.190 --> 04:41:54.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:54.200 --> 04:41:59.270 align:start position:0%
 
understand

04:41:59.270 --> 04:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:05.830 --> 04:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:08.750 --> 04:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
but yeah but this but to our discussion
 
04:42:11.670 --> 04:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
earlier about the seven years 2031 this
 
04:42:13.030 --> 04:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
is fixed until
 
04:42:16.190 --> 04:42:16.200 align:start position:0%
2031 at the moment yes at the moment
 
04:42:17.750 --> 04:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
well unless the next unless the
 
04:42:20.990 --> 04:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
legislature changes it it's it's 2031
 
04:42:21.000 --> 04:42:22.430 align:start position:0%
legislature changes it it's it's 2031
representative

04:42:22.430 --> 04:42:22.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:42:26.270 --> 04:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
Opel um I I just in that same uh section
 
04:42:27.708 --> 04:42:27.718 align:start position:0%
on line
 
04:42:32.190 --> 04:42:32.200 align:start position:0%
22 um and I I like this but it says a
 
04:42:34.030 --> 04:42:34.040 align:start position:0%
license shall not be permitted to be
 
04:42:37.350 --> 04:42:37.360 align:start position:0%
transferred or sold which it seems to me
 
04:42:38.990 --> 04:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
would be different from what Senator
 
04:42:43.230 --> 04:42:43.240 align:start position:0%
Lang was saying that in fact if if
 
04:42:46.350 --> 04:42:46.360 align:start position:0%
someone holds a license presently and
 
04:42:49.470 --> 04:42:49.480 align:start position:0%
sells their business as I read this and
 
04:42:51.868 --> 04:42:51.878 align:start position:0%
I think this should be the
 
04:42:54.550 --> 04:42:54.560 align:start position:0%
case the business could be sold but the
 
04:42:57.550 --> 04:42:57.560 align:start position:0%
license would not be sold it would be so
 
04:43:00.430 --> 04:43:00.440 align:start position:0%
the the this language exists now in law
 
04:43:04.708 --> 04:43:04.718 align:start position:0%
under HHR and the AG said that while the
 
04:43:06.788 --> 04:43:06.798 align:start position:0%
license like if you were hack the licens
 
04:43:08.590 --> 04:43:08.600 align:start position:0%
into Boston you could sell that license
 
04:43:12.030 --> 04:43:12.040 align:start position:0%
and had had value but now you have to
 
04:43:14.390 --> 04:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
buy the entire business both assets and
 
04:43:17.788 --> 04:43:17.798 align:start position:0%
liabilities and so that's been um a bit
 
04:43:20.110 --> 04:43:20.120 align:start position:0%
troubling new outfits but certainly the
 
04:43:21.948 --> 04:43:21.958 align:start position:0%
business gets sold and the license you
 
04:43:23.830 --> 04:43:23.840 align:start position:0%
maintain is transferred with the
 
04:43:27.590 --> 04:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
business so so the license can be sold
 
04:43:29.670 --> 04:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
as long as you sell it with the business
 
04:43:31.150 --> 04:43:31.160 align:start position:0%
it's more the business can be sold and
 
04:43:32.990 --> 04:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
license goes with it but yes the answer
 
04:43:34.550 --> 04:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
is yes so it's the same thing that
 
04:43:37.430 --> 04:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
Senator langu was saying yeah yeah that
 
04:43:39.708 --> 04:43:39.718 align:start position:0%
okay follow up
 
04:43:44.708 --> 04:43:44.718 align:start position:0%
yeah um my my question then is let's
 
04:43:48.190 --> 04:43:48.200 align:start position:0%
assume I own I I am a current license
 
04:43:50.070 --> 04:43:50.080 align:start position:0%
holder I have a casino that I'm
 
04:43:54.070 --> 04:43:54.080 align:start position:0%
operating or historic horse
 
04:43:57.150 --> 04:43:57.160 align:start position:0%
racing and I choose to sell that
 
04:44:02.150 --> 04:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
business the whole kitten kabo to XYZ
 
04:44:04.590 --> 04:44:04.600 align:start position:0%
gaming if I'm selling the whole business
 
04:44:06.788 --> 04:44:06.798 align:start position:0%
including the
 
04:44:08.910 --> 04:44:08.920 align:start position:0%
license where does the Lottery
 
04:44:10.910 --> 04:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
Commission come in in terms of vetting
 
04:44:10.920 --> 04:44:11.590 align:start position:0%
Commission come in in terms of vetting
that

04:44:11.590 --> 04:44:11.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:44:13.510 --> 04:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
that buyer and and I know that there's
 
04:44:15.788 --> 04:44:15.798 align:start position:0%
been a lot of news coverage about just
 
04:44:19.590 --> 04:44:19.600 align:start position:0%
that very issue but I'm I need to I've
 
04:44:21.390 --> 04:44:21.400 align:start position:0%
been reading it and now I need to
 
04:44:24.788 --> 04:44:24.798 align:start position:0%
understand it better um generally very
 
04:44:26.750 --> 04:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
very early in the process they would
 
04:44:29.990 --> 04:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
come to us um experienced gaming
 
04:44:32.750 --> 04:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
operators are used to this in fact they
 
04:44:34.190 --> 04:44:34.200 align:start position:0%
already know the hundred documents they
 
04:44:35.590 --> 04:44:35.600 align:start position:0%
need to give us and have it in a box
 
04:44:38.550 --> 04:44:38.560 align:start position:0%
ready to go um it's very rare to get an
 
04:44:40.628 --> 04:44:40.638 align:start position:0%
inexperienced gaming operator because
 
04:44:42.390 --> 04:44:42.400 align:start position:0%
these facilities do sell for large sums
 
04:44:44.470 --> 04:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
of money so we start the vetting process
 
04:44:47.990 --> 04:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
very early um Financial criminal
 
04:44:50.350 --> 04:44:50.360 align:start position:0%
business operations visit their
 
04:44:53.708 --> 04:44:53.718 align:start position:0%
facilities all of it so it's a it's a
 
04:44:56.868 --> 04:44:56.878 align:start position:0%
very detailed uh process and and folks
 
04:44:58.110 --> 04:44:58.120 align:start position:0%
there are folks who have not got through
 
04:44:59.230 --> 04:44:59.240 align:start position:0%
would have been
 
04:45:01.310 --> 04:45:01.320 align:start position:0%
rejected one last
 
04:45:01.320 --> 04:45:02.910 align:start position:0%
rejected one last
followup

04:45:02.910 --> 04:45:02.920 align:start position:0%
followup
 
04:45:06.788 --> 04:45:06.798 align:start position:0%
um are there states where the license is
 
04:45:09.670 --> 04:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
not transferable even if the business is
 
04:45:09.680 --> 04:45:13.230 align:start position:0%
not transferable even if the business is
sold

04:45:13.230 --> 04:45:13.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:14.788 --> 04:45:14.798 align:start position:0%
is not
 
04:45:17.150 --> 04:45:17.160 align:start position:0%
transferable and if and if you need to
 
04:45:19.788 --> 04:45:19.798 align:start position:0%
not that I don't I don't know all the
 
04:45:22.310 --> 04:45:22.320 align:start position:0%
the 30 some odat states that do gaming
 
04:45:23.910 --> 04:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
um like I know in New Jersey there's a
 
04:45:25.868 --> 04:45:25.878 align:start position:0%
limit on number you can own you can only
 
04:45:29.510 --> 04:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
own three um obviously tribal you have
 
04:45:32.670 --> 04:45:32.680 align:start position:0%
to be the tribe so those don't count um
 
04:45:34.510 --> 04:45:34.520 align:start position:0%
and every so often sometimes these are
 
04:45:36.628 --> 04:45:36.638 align:start position:0%
bit out like Rhode Island is a bid
 
04:45:39.150 --> 04:45:39.160 align:start position:0%
process with the state the Twin Rivers I
 
04:45:41.310 --> 04:45:41.320 align:start position:0%
believe the facilities in Mass can be
 
04:45:44.030 --> 04:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
sold uh I know that main they can be
 
04:45:46.030 --> 04:45:46.040 align:start position:0%
sold because they were sold the
 
04:45:50.150 --> 04:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
applicant for the axid license um Mr Bob
 
04:45:54.590 --> 04:45:54.600 align:start position:0%
bear sold it to Churchill DS so
 
04:45:56.708 --> 04:45:56.718 align:start position:0%
um just going in my head on Ron New
 
04:45:59.310 --> 04:45:59.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:01.350 --> 04:46:01.360 align:start position:0%
all repres
 
04:46:01.360 --> 04:46:03.310 align:start position:0%
all repres
Aly

04:46:03.310 --> 04:46:03.320 align:start position:0%
Aly
 
04:46:06.150 --> 04:46:06.160 align:start position:0%
um yes
 
04:46:11.030 --> 04:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh I I was look I I still I is there any
 
04:46:14.830 --> 04:46:14.840 align:start position:0%
place where it defines what to be
 
04:46:18.390 --> 04:46:18.400 align:start position:0%
eligible uh licensed or eligible to be
 
04:46:19.990 --> 04:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
eligible for
 
04:46:23.430 --> 04:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
lure or do we just know what it means
 
04:46:26.708 --> 04:46:26.718 align:start position:0%
and go along with that sorry my mic's
 
04:46:30.590 --> 04:46:30.600 align:start position:0%
off certainly eligible operators j4
 
04:46:33.390 --> 04:46:33.400 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral one that to me spells out
 
04:46:35.548 --> 04:46:35.558 align:start position:0%
who is eligible and it had to have been
 
04:46:38.070 --> 04:46:38.080 align:start position:0%
a historic horse racing ly as of the
 
04:46:39.910 --> 04:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
effective day of this chapter had to be
 
04:46:43.070 --> 04:46:43.080 align:start position:0%
either licensed or eligible for licenser
 
04:46:47.750 --> 04:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
this is J nj4 somewhere yes page 41
 
04:46:50.590 --> 04:46:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:53.750 --> 04:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
20 uh
 
04:46:57.350 --> 04:46:57.360 align:start position:0%
here but well it
 
04:47:00.948 --> 04:47:00.958 align:start position:0%
doesn't well it says under RSA under
 
04:47:03.590 --> 04:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
under two it it says what you have to do
 
04:47:05.910 --> 04:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
in order to do that I presume yes that
 
04:47:07.270 --> 04:47:07.280 align:start position:0%
that's the our authority to do the
 
04:47:09.310 --> 04:47:09.320 align:start position:0%
background check we require of the
 
04:47:09.320 --> 04:47:11.628 align:start position:0%
background check we require of the
applicants

04:47:11.628 --> 04:47:11.638 align:start position:0%
applicants
 
04:47:15.350 --> 04:47:15.360 align:start position:0%
okay and my other question or rather
 
04:47:18.270 --> 04:47:18.280 align:start position:0%
remark is
 
04:47:20.750 --> 04:47:20.760 align:start position:0%
that uh the commission with the
 
04:47:22.788 --> 04:47:22.798 align:start position:0%
assistance of the Attorney General and
 
04:47:25.708 --> 04:47:25.718 align:start position:0%
the chief of staff of any city or town
 
04:47:27.868 --> 04:47:27.878 align:start position:0%
where license facilities are located
 
04:47:29.590 --> 04:47:29.600 align:start position:0%
shall administer and enforce the
 
04:47:31.788 --> 04:47:31.798 align:start position:0%
provisions of this chapter we don't get
 
04:47:33.868 --> 04:47:33.878 align:start position:0%
any money for that do
 
04:47:36.150 --> 04:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
we no I think it's more protecting the
 
04:47:38.150 --> 04:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
money that we're getting
 
04:47:40.670 --> 04:47:40.680 align:start position:0%
legally we don't get money legally from
 
04:47:43.868 --> 04:47:43.878 align:start position:0%
this is from the it goes to the state it
 
04:47:46.390 --> 04:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
goes to the you mean the city town I'm
 
04:47:51.190 --> 04:47:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:51.200 --> 04:47:52.948 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:47:52.948 --> 04:47:52.958 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:47:56.548 --> 04:47:56.558 align:start position:0%
ah representative uh did shamber did you
 
04:47:59.030 --> 04:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
have your light on okay
 
04:48:03.670 --> 04:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
elberger thank you both um I want to go
 
04:48:07.230 --> 04:48:07.240 align:start position:0%
back to line 22 because the way that is
 
04:48:09.708 --> 04:48:09.718 align:start position:0%
written at the uh at the end of that
 
04:48:11.150 --> 04:48:11.160 align:start position:0%
line a license shall will not be
 
04:48:13.788 --> 04:48:13.798 align:start position:0%
permitted to be transferred or
 
04:48:16.470 --> 04:48:16.480 align:start position:0%
sold simply says it can't be transferred
 
04:48:19.788 --> 04:48:19.798 align:start position:0%
or sold there's no provision stated in
 
04:48:22.750 --> 04:48:22.760 align:start position:0%
here that it cannot be um shall not be
 
04:48:25.230 --> 04:48:25.240 align:start position:0%
permitted to be transferred or sold
 
04:48:28.628 --> 04:48:28.638 align:start position:0%
unless it's part of selling a business
 
04:48:31.150 --> 04:48:31.160 align:start position:0%
and I would absolutely want to see
 
04:48:32.990 --> 04:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
language that indicates that because
 
04:48:34.750 --> 04:48:34.760 align:start position:0%
right now it says you simply can't
 
04:48:36.590 --> 04:48:36.600 align:start position:0%
transfer to well that must be somewhere
 
04:48:39.110 --> 04:48:39.120 align:start position:0%
right where where is it that it's just
 
04:48:40.990 --> 04:48:41.000 align:start position:0%
in uh opinion we receed from the
 
04:48:43.310 --> 04:48:43.320 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office related to
 
04:48:46.230 --> 04:48:46.240 align:start position:0%
can't limit it's part of the business
 
04:48:48.670 --> 04:48:48.680 align:start position:0%
and that business can be sold and that B
 
04:48:50.510 --> 04:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
it's you didn't transfer it because ABC
 
04:48:53.788 --> 04:48:53.798 align:start position:0%
Corp still owns it ABC Corp is now sold
 
04:48:55.750 --> 04:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
to another company it's still called ABC
 
04:48:57.590 --> 04:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
Corp still holds the same number of
 
04:48:59.430 --> 04:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
things it had before assets and
 
04:49:02.390 --> 04:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
liabilities uh it was not our decision
 
04:49:04.110 --> 04:49:04.120 align:start position:0%
it's a it was a legal opinion so what
 
04:49:05.430 --> 04:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
you're saying is it's not necessarily
 
04:49:05.440 --> 04:49:06.548 align:start position:0%
you're saying is it's not necessarily
specific

04:49:06.548 --> 04:49:06.558 align:start position:0%
specific
 
04:49:11.390 --> 04:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
to um casinos casinos it's like any any
 
04:49:14.230 --> 04:49:14.240 align:start position:0%
asset so when a business is sold all the
 
04:49:16.470 --> 04:49:16.480 align:start position:0%
assets and liabilities go to the new
 
04:49:18.628 --> 04:49:18.638 align:start position:0%
yeah that's just common business prti
 
04:49:20.110 --> 04:49:20.120 align:start position:0%
corre most of the time you you want to
 
04:49:21.670 --> 04:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
buy the assets not the liability so
 
04:49:23.868 --> 04:49:23.878 align:start position:0%
usually just buy the equipment because
 
04:49:25.470 --> 04:49:25.480 align:start position:0%
you don't want to buy any unforeseen
 
04:49:27.230 --> 04:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
liabilities but stops you from just
 
04:49:29.430 --> 04:49:29.440 align:start position:0%
buying the yes but in this instance you
 
04:49:31.190 --> 04:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
have to buy the liabilities it's one of
 
04:49:33.628 --> 04:49:33.638 align:start position:0%
the issues related to number lienes is
 
04:49:34.910 --> 04:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
you're buying at all it's like buying a
 
04:49:37.030 --> 04:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
land so this is more part OFA the answer
 
04:49:38.830 --> 04:49:38.840 align:start position:0%
to your question is it's already in what
 
04:49:40.270 --> 04:49:40.280 align:start position:0%
case law or I don't know how you would
 
04:49:41.868 --> 04:49:41.878 align:start position:0%
it was in opinion we said because the
 
04:49:43.628 --> 04:49:43.638 align:start position:0%
we're the first applicant who went to
 
04:49:46.230 --> 04:49:46.240 align:start position:0%
sell the business from the same company
 
04:49:47.670 --> 04:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
just to sell it somebody else we
 
04:49:49.590 --> 04:49:49.600 align:start position:0%
submitted to the General's office our
 
04:49:51.990 --> 04:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
compliance officer did five years ago
 
04:49:54.310 --> 04:49:54.320 align:start position:0%
four years ago and uh that's the opinion
 
04:49:57.310 --> 04:49:57.320 align:start position:0%
we were given yeah
 
04:50:00.830 --> 04:50:00.840 align:start position:0%
okay sh thank you Mr
 
04:50:00.840 --> 04:50:02.750 align:start position:0%
okay sh thank you Mr
chairman

04:50:02.750 --> 04:50:02.760 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
04:50:05.830 --> 04:50:05.840 align:start position:0%
director thinking out of the box here I
 
04:50:08.430 --> 04:50:08.440 align:start position:0%
just had a podiatrist work on my feet
 
04:50:11.788 --> 04:50:11.798 align:start position:0%
okay I went into the office and I saw a
 
04:50:14.990 --> 04:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
license on the wall mhm if that
 
04:50:18.670 --> 04:50:18.680 align:start position:0%
podiatrist sells that business is that
 
04:50:22.350 --> 04:50:22.360 align:start position:0%
license on the wall stay there for that
 
04:50:26.110 --> 04:50:26.120 align:start position:0%
business or is it go with the owner of
 
04:50:27.990 --> 04:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
the business who has the degree and
 
04:50:30.948 --> 04:50:30.958 align:start position:0%
things like that uh I'm having a hard
 
04:50:32.670 --> 04:50:32.680 align:start position:0%
time this English language is supposed
 
04:50:35.990 --> 04:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
to be simple and it is simple that's so
 
04:50:38.470 --> 04:50:38.480 align:start position:0%
so m i
 
04:50:41.270 --> 04:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
could the ability to apply for the
 
04:50:42.750 --> 04:50:42.760 align:start position:0%
license is what you're buying from the
 
04:50:44.430 --> 04:50:44.440 align:start position:0%
business so it's not I'm not
 
04:50:46.270 --> 04:50:46.280 align:start position:0%
transferring your license saying here
 
04:50:49.110 --> 04:50:49.120 align:start position:0%
this this is belongs to you now you have
 
04:50:50.708 --> 04:50:50.718 align:start position:0%
to go through the vetting process to be
 
04:50:52.670 --> 04:50:52.680 align:start position:0%
eligible to it but you are not eligible
 
04:50:54.390 --> 04:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
for it so the new because because in
 
04:50:56.470 --> 04:50:56.480 align:start position:0%
your example a podiatrist another
 
04:50:59.190 --> 04:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
podiatrist could buy the
 
04:51:01.910 --> 04:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
business they could buy the business
 
04:51:03.470 --> 04:51:03.480 align:start position:0%
which is the building but they would
 
04:51:05.470 --> 04:51:05.480 align:start position:0%
have to be licensed correct correct it's
 
04:51:07.470 --> 04:51:07.480 align:start position:0%
similar to us we buy the business and
 
04:51:10.150 --> 04:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
you still they can still buy the license
 
04:51:12.310 --> 04:51:12.320 align:start position:0%
but com with the
 
04:51:14.670 --> 04:51:14.680 align:start position:0%
business but the new the new person that
 
04:51:16.390 --> 04:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
bought or the new entity that bought the
 
04:51:20.030 --> 04:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
business has to be licensed has to get
 
04:51:22.110 --> 04:51:22.120 align:start position:0%
approved has to go full full like
 
04:51:23.470 --> 04:51:23.480 align:start position:0%
they're like okay great I got my license
 
04:51:24.948 --> 04:51:24.958 align:start position:0%
I'm all set they still have to get
 
04:51:27.310 --> 04:51:27.320 align:start position:0%
approved yeah as well and we like I said
 
04:51:28.788 --> 04:51:28.798 align:start position:0%
we have rejected individuals in that
 
04:51:32.510 --> 04:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
process directly all right good uh I
 
04:51:34.390 --> 04:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
mean not good that you rejected just
 
04:51:37.910 --> 04:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
good that we can uh we solve that
 
04:51:41.390 --> 04:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
rejecting um excellent okay what else on
 
04:51:44.910 --> 04:51:44.920 align:start position:0%
this page um I I jumped down to line 35
 
04:51:47.548 --> 04:51:47.558 align:start position:0%
and I said VTS shall not accept wages in
 
04:51:48.590 --> 04:51:48.600 align:start position:0%
excess of
 
04:51:51.750 --> 04:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
$25 which in my mind I thought maybe
 
04:51:53.110 --> 04:51:53.120 align:start position:0%
that should be 50 because didn't we
 
04:51:55.670 --> 04:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
raise games of chance to 50 or which one
 
04:51:57.750 --> 04:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
we raised something to table States
 
04:52:01.788 --> 04:52:01.798 align:start position:0%
table this is every second that you're
 
04:52:03.910 --> 04:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
pushing that button and you're doing
 
04:52:05.910 --> 04:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
another 25
 
04:52:09.310 --> 04:52:09.320 align:start position:0%
bucks so it adds up
 
04:52:12.670 --> 04:52:12.680 align:start position:0%
fast that's what back
 
04:52:18.150 --> 04:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
UPS okay opinion opinions on that 25
 
04:52:19.470 --> 04:52:19.480 align:start position:0%
actually if you're playing Blackjack
 
04:52:22.070 --> 04:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
that goes by pretty fast
 
04:52:25.510 --> 04:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
though so what do you think about
 
04:52:37.150 --> 04:52:37.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:40.948 --> 04:52:40.958 align:start position:0%
faster I have no problem with okay
 
04:52:44.190 --> 04:52:44.200 align:start position:0%
people like 25 but it's up to 25 a lot
 
04:52:46.948 --> 04:52:46.958 align:start position:0%
of people might do five yeah yeah no I
 
04:52:49.070 --> 04:52:49.080 align:start position:0%
mean like coin Opera machines are so
 
04:52:53.190 --> 04:52:53.200 align:start position:0%
much better you can get nickels
 
04:52:56.390 --> 04:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
dyes the represent early the load
 
04:52:58.830 --> 04:52:58.840 align:start position:0%
capacity for the for the count room is
 
04:53:01.350 --> 04:53:01.360 align:start position:0%
brutal we we've broken buildings with
 
04:53:03.270 --> 04:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
coins in our
 
04:53:06.190 --> 04:53:06.200 align:start position:0%
industry any any other thoughts comments
 
04:53:10.788 --> 04:53:10.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:13.590 --> 04:53:13.600 align:start position:0%
so where uh so before we move on what is
 
04:53:15.990 --> 04:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
so we have no I guess we have no
 
04:53:21.510 --> 04:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:24.910 --> 04:53:24.920 align:start position:0%
correct I'd like to suggest
 
04:53:28.070 --> 04:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
that the city or town in which these
 
04:53:33.110 --> 04:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
things are you be getting at least some
 
04:53:35.270 --> 04:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
compensation for everything they have to
 
04:53:37.750 --> 04:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
go through why don't we pay them at the
 
04:53:46.310 --> 04:53:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:49.590 --> 04:53:49.600 align:start position:0%
all right um yeah I think changes like
 
04:53:51.150 --> 04:53:51.160 align:start position:0%
that might have to come through a
 
04:53:53.190 --> 04:53:53.200 align:start position:0%
through a separate bill I'm thinking
 
04:53:55.628 --> 04:53:55.638 align:start position:0%
that we can suggest that all we want I'm
 
04:54:03.830 --> 04:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:06.670 --> 04:54:06.680 align:start position:0%
in yeah but an opt in and opt out those
 
04:54:08.708 --> 04:54:08.718 align:start position:0%
that's already coming through in other
 
04:54:10.830 --> 04:54:10.840 align:start position:0%
bills that have been passed 24 7 went
 
04:54:15.510 --> 04:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
through unanimously we just passed uh
 
04:54:21.150 --> 04:54:21.160 align:start position:0%
737 737 the chief police out of this
 
04:54:26.670 --> 04:54:26.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:28.910 --> 04:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
four because the commission and the
 
04:54:30.990 --> 04:54:31.000 align:start position:0%
Attorney General are paid by the state
 
04:54:33.070 --> 04:54:33.080 align:start position:0%
but the chief of
 
04:54:37.070 --> 04:54:37.080 align:start position:0%
police is in a bind if he has to have
 
04:54:41.310 --> 04:54:41.320 align:start position:0%
somebody always there when he's on 12
 
04:54:47.590 --> 04:54:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:47.600 --> 04:54:49.470 align:start position:0%
 
shifts

04:54:49.470 --> 04:54:49.480 align:start position:0%
shifts
 
04:54:51.390 --> 04:54:51.400 align:start position:0%
well I feel like we're going to go down
 
04:54:53.750 --> 04:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
a rabbit hole on this one uh represent
 
04:54:55.270 --> 04:54:55.280 align:start position:0%
Amy I don't necessarily disagree with
 
04:54:59.750 --> 04:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
you but um I think how how however their
 
04:55:03.030 --> 04:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
language allowing the chief of police to
 
04:55:05.910 --> 04:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
uh do detail work at the facility for
 
04:55:09.190 --> 04:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
the purpose of enforcing should be clear
 
04:55:10.350 --> 04:55:10.360 align:start position:0%
well that would be well they would get
 
04:55:13.510 --> 04:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
get paid for that yes right yeah they
 
04:55:16.030 --> 04:55:16.040 align:start position:0%
could to that point most of the rooms do
 
04:55:17.830 --> 04:55:17.840 align:start position:0%
hire police departments for details
 
04:55:20.430 --> 04:55:20.440 align:start position:0%
particularly on weekends regular I'm
 
04:55:23.470 --> 04:55:23.480 align:start position:0%
just kind of thinking that's what the uh
 
04:55:25.070 --> 04:55:25.080 align:start position:0%
age limit I mean they're not going to
 
04:55:28.390 --> 04:55:28.400 align:start position:0%
get into the technical uh analysis of a
 
04:55:31.230 --> 04:55:31.240 align:start position:0%
slot machine but you got to be 21 you
 
04:55:34.548 --> 04:55:34.558 align:start position:0%
got or 18 or whatever it yeah and you
 
04:55:36.830 --> 04:55:36.840 align:start position:0%
you can't be drunk and and all these
 
04:55:38.788 --> 04:55:38.798 align:start position:0%
facilities have significant Securities
 
04:55:42.990 --> 04:55:43.000 align:start position:0%
departments they really do really
 
04:55:45.030 --> 04:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
really they have to well they don't want
 
04:55:47.788 --> 04:55:47.798 align:start position:0%
things to get out of control yeah yeah
 
04:55:51.510 --> 04:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
all I think uh you might uh recommend to
 
04:55:53.868 --> 04:55:53.878 align:start position:0%
them that the language uh be more clear
 
04:56:05.708 --> 04:56:05.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:05.718 --> 04:56:08.628 align:start position:0%
 
work

04:56:08.628 --> 04:56:08.638 align:start position:0%
work
 
04:56:10.948 --> 04:56:10.958 align:start position:0%
okay very good
 
04:56:10.958 --> 04:56:12.868 align:start position:0%
okay very good
page

04:56:12.868 --> 04:56:12.878 align:start position:0%
page
 
04:56:16.390 --> 04:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
42 and bear has was in the
 
04:56:20.350 --> 04:56:20.360 align:start position:0%
game pardon bear was in the gaming he
 
04:56:22.868 --> 04:56:22.878 align:start position:0%
was the original owner of Oxford track
 
04:56:24.590 --> 04:56:24.600 align:start position:0%
in Oxford Maine that he was the
 
04:56:27.030 --> 04:56:27.040 align:start position:0%
applicant for the license uh and
 
04:56:29.150 --> 04:56:29.160 align:start position:0%
received a gaming license and opened up
 
04:56:31.430 --> 04:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
Oxford Casino and the French family let
 
04:56:32.750 --> 04:56:32.760 align:start position:0%
him do
 
04:56:38.510 --> 04:56:38.520 align:start position:0%
that I he was in Maine the NASCAR yeah
 
04:56:39.788 --> 04:56:39.798 align:start position:0%
yeah he wasn't he was not longer than
 
04:56:43.788 --> 04:56:43.798 align:start position:0%
NASCAR owner but he was the yeah
 
04:56:47.030 --> 04:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
well all right I'll um I need to uh
 
04:56:49.110 --> 04:56:49.120 align:start position:0%
correct myself from what I said earlier
 
04:56:52.390 --> 04:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
on Senator Langs uh the stuff I said
 
04:56:54.510 --> 04:56:54.520 align:start position:0%
this what he's talking about is in is
 
04:56:57.390 --> 04:56:57.400 align:start position:0%
what we'll deal with 728 but I I forgot
 
04:57:00.708 --> 04:57:00.718 align:start position:0%
on page 42 line six that's one of the
 
04:57:03.590 --> 04:57:03.600 align:start position:0%
things he was addressing in his bill um
 
04:57:05.510 --> 04:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
and he was also addressing in line 13
 
04:57:09.110 --> 04:57:09.120 align:start position:0%
and 14 the percentages um so I just
 
04:57:10.868 --> 04:57:10.878 align:start position:0%
wanted to correct myself out so we are
 
04:57:14.708 --> 04:57:14.718 align:start position:0%
going to look at that now um so on line
 
04:57:14.718 --> 04:57:17.948 align:start position:0%
going to look at that now um so on line
six

04:57:17.948 --> 04:57:17.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:22.030 --> 04:57:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:25.670 --> 04:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
one on minimum average daily aggregate
 
04:57:28.910 --> 04:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
payback of 88% as I
 
04:57:33.990 --> 04:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
recall that is lower than any of these
 
04:57:36.788 --> 04:57:36.798 align:start position:0%
use yeah it's a um represent it's a
 
04:57:38.270 --> 04:57:38.280 align:start position:0%
minimum so it's really a consumer
 
04:57:40.788 --> 04:57:40.798 align:start position:0%
protection I know that sounds ironic in
 
04:57:42.030 --> 04:57:42.040 align:start position:0%
this context but it's really to make
 
04:57:44.390 --> 04:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
sure that the operators in a location
 
04:57:46.390 --> 04:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
where there's no other competition don't
 
04:57:50.470 --> 04:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
have lower payouts to make a so that
 
04:57:52.590 --> 04:57:52.600 align:start position:0%
thinking if there was one in Berlin
 
04:57:54.548 --> 04:57:54.558 align:start position:0%
correct one in Bur yeah one in yes one
 
04:57:58.788 --> 04:57:58.798 align:start position:0%
in an isolated location like Conway
 
04:58:01.270 --> 04:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
um none of them have been running on
 
04:58:04.070 --> 04:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
that no they're all about 90% yeah you
 
04:58:08.070 --> 04:58:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:10.990 --> 04:58:11.000 align:start position:0%
percent fall back position
 
04:58:12.948 --> 04:58:12.958 align:start position:0%
okay if anyone does anyone have anything
 
04:58:16.110 --> 04:58:16.120 align:start position:0%
on lines two through
 
04:58:19.350 --> 04:58:19.360 align:start position:0%
five before I go to line six okay line
 
04:58:22.110 --> 04:58:22.120 align:start position:0%
six uh 45% is what the governor has put
 
04:58:25.830 --> 04:58:25.840 align:start position:0%
in uh her budget um from what we heard
 
04:58:29.470 --> 04:58:29.480 align:start position:0%
from Senator Lang that's probably a non
 
04:58:31.350 --> 04:58:31.360 align:start position:0%
a nonstarter for these businesses to
 
04:58:34.470 --> 04:58:34.480 align:start position:0%
even take a chance um on New
 
04:58:37.750 --> 04:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um so this in in his bill he's
 
04:58:40.548 --> 04:58:40.558 align:start position:0%
got 35%
 
04:58:43.750 --> 04:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
and in the bill we have 728 it's
 
04:58:43.760 --> 04:58:45.150 align:start position:0%
and in the bill we have 728 it's
currently

04:58:45.150 --> 04:58:45.160 align:start position:0%
currently
 
04:58:47.270 --> 04:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
30% um that's the bill we heard this
 
04:58:51.110 --> 04:58:51.120 align:start position:0%
morning public hearing um so what do we
 
04:58:52.788 --> 04:58:52.798 align:start position:0%
want to recommend I mean I'm in some
 
04:58:54.030 --> 04:58:54.040 align:start position:0%
ways we're getting ahead of ourselves
 
04:58:55.390 --> 04:58:55.400 align:start position:0%
because we just heard this bill this
 
04:58:57.270 --> 04:58:57.280 align:start position:0%
morning and I know this isn't the bill
 
04:58:59.670 --> 04:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
we heard but this is a component of the
 
04:59:03.830 --> 04:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
bill we heard um and it sounds like from
 
04:59:07.190 --> 04:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
what Senator Lang's discussions have
 
04:59:09.868 --> 04:59:09.878 align:start position:0%
been is that he did he recommend 32 and
 
04:59:14.390 --> 04:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
a now he was yes um but he's got 35
 
04:59:17.470 --> 04:59:17.480 align:start position:0%
going he's got 35 right now got 35 going
 
04:59:20.948 --> 04:59:20.958 align:start position:0%
through so it's it's you
 
04:59:24.750 --> 04:59:24.760 align:start position:0%
know um representing Murphy uh committee
 
04:59:27.030 --> 04:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
the conference back rooms nobody knows
 
04:59:31.190 --> 04:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
what's going on um until it comes out
 
04:59:34.070 --> 04:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
then you're agree or disagree those the
 
04:59:36.868 --> 04:59:36.878 align:start position:0%
only votes you have so what he's saying
 
04:59:40.390 --> 04:59:40.400 align:start position:0%
what rep Senator Lang had suggested was
 
04:59:44.230 --> 04:59:44.240 align:start position:0%
he can get it passed in Senate at
 
04:59:47.788 --> 04:59:47.798 align:start position:0%
35 we just got it passed out of here at
 
04:59:50.350 --> 04:59:50.360 align:start position:0%
30 no we we didn't pass anything yet
 
04:59:53.548 --> 04:59:53.558 align:start position:0%
well we're the bill proposes 30 the bill
 
04:59:56.670 --> 04:59:56.680 align:start position:0%
proposes 30 so some halfway between is
 
04:59:59.830 --> 04:59:59.840 align:start position:0%
32 and a half which is where it will
 
05:00:02.310 --> 05:00:02.320 align:start position:0%
likely come out if we don't bother with
 
05:00:05.070 --> 05:00:05.080 align:start position:0%
anything so don't
 
05:00:08.430 --> 05:00:08.440 align:start position:0%
bother at this point you can recommend
 
05:00:15.750 --> 05:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:19.110 --> 05:00:19.120 align:start position:0%
if I could Mr chairman the the 45 the 45
 
05:00:21.990 --> 05:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
number was at my suggestion given the
 
05:00:24.628 --> 05:00:24.638 align:start position:0%
existing Marketplace in the U um New
 
05:00:26.350 --> 05:00:26.360 align:start position:0%
England and the fact that there are
 
05:00:27.868 --> 05:00:27.878 align:start position:0%
really three economic levers for
 
05:00:30.670 --> 05:00:30.680 align:start position:0%
sighting a casino there's what you pay
 
05:00:33.110 --> 05:00:33.120 align:start position:0%
up front is a tax rate what you pay I
 
05:00:34.830 --> 05:00:34.840 align:start position:0%
mean a license fee what you pay as a
 
05:00:37.350 --> 05:00:37.360 align:start position:0%
going rev share model and then what you
 
05:00:39.628 --> 05:00:39.638 align:start position:0%
make them do and New Hampshire is at the
 
05:00:41.110 --> 05:00:41.120 align:start position:0%
lowest end of all three of those
 
05:00:43.190 --> 05:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
functions we don't charge a license fee
 
05:00:44.590 --> 05:00:44.600 align:start position:0%
or Le
 
05:00:46.830 --> 05:00:46.840 align:start position:0%
$750 we don't make them do anything
 
05:00:49.628 --> 05:00:49.638 align:start position:0%
Capital wise uh whereas in Boston they
 
05:00:51.788 --> 05:00:51.798 align:start position:0%
made Encore build a $2.4 billion do
 
05:00:55.110 --> 05:00:55.120 align:start position:0%
casino and our rate at 25% is the lowest
 
05:00:58.350 --> 05:00:58.360 align:start position:0%
in New England um amongst all operators
 
05:01:01.110 --> 05:01:01.120 align:start position:0%
where Maine and Vermont Main's at 46 and
 
05:01:03.310 --> 05:01:03.320 align:start position:0%
49 the plane roid facility in
 
05:01:06.510 --> 05:01:06.520 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts is at is at 49 R Island's
 
05:01:10.230 --> 05:01:10.240 align:start position:0%
at 60 um Encore while they're at 25% %
 
05:01:12.510 --> 05:01:12.520 align:start position:0%
did require $2.4 billion capital
 
05:01:15.110 --> 05:01:15.120 align:start position:0%
expenditure and had $85 million license
 
05:01:17.310 --> 05:01:17.320 align:start position:0%
fee um
 
05:01:21.750 --> 05:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
so it was not a if we could do this over
 
05:01:23.548 --> 05:01:23.558 align:start position:0%
again and if I have my time machine I
 
05:01:25.990 --> 05:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
would go back and make the 25% on HHR
 
05:01:28.670 --> 05:01:28.680 align:start position:0%
higher because their revenue numbers as
 
05:01:30.230 --> 05:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
we're mind were based off of a per
 
05:01:33.070 --> 05:01:33.080 align:start position:0%
machine tag of $150 per machine and now
 
05:01:35.670 --> 05:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
they're running at two40 250 and the
 
05:01:38.190 --> 05:01:38.200 align:start position:0%
Southern Tier it's over $300 a machine
 
05:01:40.750 --> 05:01:40.760 align:start position:0%
and a lot of those capex cost are fixed
 
05:01:42.670 --> 05:01:42.680 align:start position:0%
real estate's fixed the machine's fixed
 
05:01:45.030 --> 05:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
you know they pay for the O the Box
 
05:01:46.830 --> 05:01:46.840 align:start position:0%
itself is fixed obviously the content
 
05:01:51.070 --> 05:01:51.080 align:start position:0%
costs extra money so I guess it's
 
05:01:53.830 --> 05:01:53.840 align:start position:0%
a you know I view my job as making the
 
05:01:55.868 --> 05:01:55.878 align:start position:0%
best deal I can for the state and so
 
05:01:57.470 --> 05:01:57.480 align:start position:0%
that's why I suggested the number that I
 
05:01:59.190 --> 05:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
did that's in here in
 
05:02:02.510 --> 05:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
law I just wanted to make my sales pitch
 
05:02:04.868 --> 05:02:04.878 align:start position:0%
I'm a Salesman for a living
 
05:02:07.548 --> 05:02:07.558 align:start position:0%
so yes that was that was my number based
 
05:02:09.230 --> 05:02:09.240 align:start position:0%
off of what I believed would be a fair
 
05:02:10.628 --> 05:02:10.638 align:start position:0%
number and
 
05:02:13.628 --> 05:02:13.638 align:start position:0%
I've not seen the math that disputes it
 
05:02:15.948 --> 05:02:15.958 align:start position:0%
but that's without adjusting other types
 
05:02:18.030 --> 05:02:18.040 align:start position:0%
of fees like you said a renewal fee ex
 
05:02:19.590 --> 05:02:19.600 align:start position:0%
exactly like without any of those
 
05:02:21.910 --> 05:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
numbers just per just just a straight
 
05:02:23.670 --> 05:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
rev model like they do better we do
 
05:02:26.390 --> 05:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
better um and there is a natural lift
 
05:02:29.270 --> 05:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
with going from HHR to VT you folks
 
05:02:31.750 --> 05:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't see it but because of the math
 
05:02:33.708 --> 05:02:33.718 align:start position:0%
because it uses different technology in
 
05:02:35.110 --> 05:02:35.120 align:start position:0%
the back and I don't want to geek out
 
05:02:37.868 --> 05:02:37.878 align:start position:0%
and bore you but it's much better and it
 
05:02:41.230 --> 05:02:41.240 align:start position:0%
will have a a natural lift that
 
05:02:43.868 --> 05:02:43.878 align:start position:0%
everybody will feel um and that's why I
 
05:02:45.270 --> 05:02:45.280 align:start position:0%
suggested the number only said just to
 
05:02:47.430 --> 05:02:47.440 align:start position:0%
make the best I could for the state well
 
05:02:49.350 --> 05:02:49.360 align:start position:0%
the best number for the
 
05:02:54.310 --> 05:02:54.320 align:start position:0%
State op just um two points you know in
 
05:02:57.350 --> 05:02:57.360 align:start position:0%
in addition to the capex being lower
 
05:03:00.750 --> 05:03:00.760 align:start position:0%
here um maybe not compared to Maine or
 
05:03:02.230 --> 05:03:02.240 align:start position:0%
Vermont but certainly compared to
 
05:03:05.350 --> 05:03:05.360 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and Connecticut um and our
 
05:03:07.750 --> 05:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
addressable Market is certainly bigger
 
05:03:10.590 --> 05:03:10.600 align:start position:0%
than either Maine or Vermont yeah um you
 
05:03:13.510 --> 05:03:13.520 align:start position:0%
know give as close as we are to Boston
 
05:03:16.310 --> 05:03:16.320 align:start position:0%
and the rest of the North Shore um I I
 
05:03:19.350 --> 05:03:19.360 align:start position:0%
would think that you know and and I
 
05:03:21.430 --> 05:03:21.440 align:start position:0%
would particularly rely on the on the
 
05:03:24.350 --> 05:03:24.360 align:start position:0%
director and his number um I think we're
 
05:03:26.510 --> 05:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
already as he says I think we're already
 
05:03:30.150 --> 05:03:30.160 align:start position:0%
selling ourselves cheap um in this area
 
05:03:34.190 --> 05:03:34.200 align:start position:0%
and frankly we need the revenue um one
 
05:03:36.310 --> 05:03:36.320 align:start position:0%
other thing and I may be jumping ahead
 
05:03:38.310 --> 05:03:38.320 align:start position:0%
here Mr chairman if I if I am I
 
05:03:41.708 --> 05:03:41.718 align:start position:0%
apologize but um and not to steal the
 
05:03:43.910 --> 05:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
Thunder of my friend from Hanover
 
05:03:47.910 --> 05:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
representative Spar um I do I do think
 
05:03:49.948 --> 05:03:49.958 align:start position:0%
it would be helpful if we could somehow
 
05:03:53.628 --> 05:03:53.638 align:start position:0%
and this may be outside our lane but um
 
05:03:56.788 --> 05:03:56.798 align:start position:0%
suggest to the finance committee that
 
05:03:59.788 --> 05:03:59.798 align:start position:0%
some mechanism for spreading the wealth
 
05:04:04.270 --> 05:04:04.280 align:start position:0%
among Charities would be um should be
 
05:04:06.270 --> 05:04:06.280 align:start position:0%
pursued yeah I don't think that'll
 
05:04:07.708 --> 05:04:07.718 align:start position:0%
happen in the finance committee that
 
05:04:10.230 --> 05:04:10.240 align:start position:0%
will probably happen in this a in the
 
05:04:13.948 --> 05:04:13.958 align:start position:0%
commission okay um
 
05:04:17.948 --> 05:04:17.958 align:start position:0%
yeah um I'm still here representative I
 
05:04:20.750 --> 05:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
know yes I understand why you get drawn
 
05:04:23.788 --> 05:04:23.798 align:start position:0%
to the right believe me um I'd like to
 
05:04:26.708 --> 05:04:26.718 align:start position:0%
stay with 45 yeah I don't always agree
 
05:04:28.190 --> 05:04:28.200 align:start position:0%
with the governor but I think that's a
 
05:04:29.788 --> 05:04:29.798 align:start position:0%
good place to start because I think
 
05:04:32.070 --> 05:04:32.080 align:start position:0%
there will be some compromises but I
 
05:04:33.868 --> 05:04:33.878 align:start position:0%
would much rather start there than in
 
05:04:36.270 --> 05:04:36.280 align:start position:0%
the 30s so that would be my
 
05:04:39.948 --> 05:04:39.958 align:start position:0%
recommendation stick with 45 for now and
 
05:04:42.070 --> 05:04:42.080 align:start position:0%
and that's Mr McIntyre's recommendation
 
05:04:45.628 --> 05:04:45.638 align:start position:0%
too right and goe yes yes it it was was
 
05:04:47.910 --> 05:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
as if I could redo it over again right
 
05:04:50.270 --> 05:04:50.280 align:start position:0%
where versus the businesses having lost
 
05:04:53.590 --> 05:04:53.600 align:start position:0%
something I wouldn't start hr25 now it
 
05:04:55.190 --> 05:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
is where it is now it's in law looking
 
05:04:57.430 --> 05:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
at our neighbors in Massachusetts it
 
05:05:00.110 --> 05:05:00.120 align:start position:0%
says 49 I think so Mass there's a
 
05:05:02.708 --> 05:05:02.718 align:start position:0%
facility called PL Ridge in for slot for
 
05:05:05.628 --> 05:05:05.638 align:start position:0%
slots that said 49 plus 600 per per
 
05:05:07.708 --> 05:05:07.718 align:start position:0%
machine $600 they pay per machine
 
05:05:09.350 --> 05:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
correct which is a lot and they paid
 
05:05:11.390 --> 05:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
they had the plane ridge had $125
 
05:05:15.350 --> 05:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
million minimum capital investment um
 
05:05:17.830 --> 05:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
and like I said Maine in Vermont sorry
 
05:05:19.390 --> 05:05:19.400 align:start position:0%
not for on Maine the two facilities in
 
05:05:21.910 --> 05:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
Maine Banger and Oxford are at 46 and
 
05:05:26.190 --> 05:05:26.200 align:start position:0%
49% respectively and they also pay a fee
 
05:05:28.430 --> 05:05:28.440 align:start position:0%
um yeah for machine and I also pay a
 
05:05:31.788 --> 05:05:31.798 align:start position:0%
license I think it's $200,000 is
 
05:05:35.030 --> 05:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
80 80,000 annually for license is that
 
05:05:37.110 --> 05:05:37.120 align:start position:0%
is that a renewal is that the oh I'm
 
05:05:38.788 --> 05:05:38.798 align:start position:0%
talking about the original application
 
05:05:40.590 --> 05:05:40.600 align:start position:0%
oral okay and then there's I think the
 
05:05:48.548 --> 05:05:48.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:52.670 --> 05:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:55.830 --> 05:05:55.840 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman in my notes it
 
05:05:57.868 --> 05:05:57.878 align:start position:0%
says that Senator Lang pointed out that
 
05:05:57.878 --> 05:05:58.670 align:start position:0%
says that Senator Lang pointed out that
at

05:05:58.670 --> 05:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
at
 
05:06:01.310 --> 05:06:01.320 align:start position:0%
45% this might cause the operators to
 
05:06:04.070 --> 05:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
lose 2% every year by going to the slot
 
05:06:06.628 --> 05:06:06.638 align:start position:0%
machines can you address that please
 
05:06:08.510 --> 05:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
certainly what he's suggesting is his
 
05:06:10.708 --> 05:06:10.718 align:start position:0%
math isn't wrong it's
 
05:06:14.788 --> 05:06:14.798 align:start position:0%
um they pay 25% now they pay a fee on
 
05:06:19.190 --> 05:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
top of that 18% get to 43 at 45 there's
 
05:06:21.470 --> 05:06:21.480 align:start position:0%
a 2% Gap but that doesn't take into
 
05:06:26.190 --> 05:06:26.200 align:start position:0%
account that the migration of HHR to VTS
 
05:06:29.470 --> 05:06:29.480 align:start position:0%
will minimally have a 10% lift and by my
 
05:06:33.270 --> 05:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
math 30% lift and so there's a it's a
 
05:06:34.948 --> 05:06:34.958 align:start position:0%
rising tide that lifts all boats and
 
05:06:43.510 --> 05:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:46.230 --> 05:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:49.948 --> 05:06:49.958 align:start position:0%
here next okay next well I don't so I
 
05:06:51.548 --> 05:06:51.558 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
05:06:51.558 --> 05:06:55.548 align:start position:0%
don't know
what

05:06:55.548 --> 05:06:55.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:57.470 --> 05:06:57.480 align:start position:0%
we'll yeah I don't think we can really
 
05:06:59.190 --> 05:06:59.200 align:start position:0%
vote on that percentage because I know
 
05:07:01.390 --> 05:07:01.400 align:start position:0%
there's there's some who who do not like
 
05:07:05.910 --> 05:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
this 45% so
 
05:07:10.470 --> 05:07:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:14.070 --> 05:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
probably yeah it's um we ended up with
 
05:07:18.910 --> 05:07:18.920 align:start position:0%
no money from B because the Senate
 
05:07:25.110 --> 05:07:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:29.070 --> 05:07:29.080 align:start position:0%
way no
 
05:07:31.430 --> 05:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
State well I think I think the issue is
 
05:07:34.628 --> 05:07:34.638 align:start position:0%
I I can't talk to specifics but um I do
 
05:07:38.350 --> 05:07:38.360 align:start position:0%
know of situations where this 45% is
 
05:07:40.310 --> 05:07:40.320 align:start position:0%
going to cause
 
05:07:44.350 --> 05:07:44.360 align:start position:0%
angst well more than angst
 
05:07:48.670 --> 05:07:48.680 align:start position:0%
um business issues and what's that I
 
05:07:53.030 --> 05:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
know what you mean not of so um yeah so
 
05:07:54.948 --> 05:07:54.958 align:start position:0%
I think the the and it may be why the
 
05:07:57.628 --> 05:07:57.638 align:start position:0%
Senate is at
 
05:08:02.548 --> 05:08:02.558 align:start position:0%
35% but yeah so um thank you Mr chair so
 
05:08:04.548 --> 05:08:04.558 align:start position:0%
do you think just targeting a number
 
05:08:06.190 --> 05:08:06.200 align:start position:0%
slightly lower than
 
05:08:10.708 --> 05:08:10.718 align:start position:0%
45 like 42 might be
 
05:08:14.310 --> 05:08:14.320 align:start position:0%
no it's not going to fly so what the
 
05:08:16.628 --> 05:08:16.638 align:start position:0%
what's like 35 is where it's going to
 
05:08:19.150 --> 05:08:19.160 align:start position:0%
fly or 32 and a half or what I think I
 
05:08:21.150 --> 05:08:21.160 align:start position:0%
think it's going to be what Senator L
 
05:08:23.590 --> 05:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
suggested as a compromise of 32 and a
 
05:08:27.030 --> 05:08:27.040 align:start position:0%
half is where it's going to end up so uh
 
05:08:29.390 --> 05:08:29.400 align:start position:0%
well he was talking about line eight
 
05:08:31.190 --> 05:08:31.200 align:start position:0%
you're talking about line no he's
 
05:08:34.110 --> 05:08:34.120 align:start position:0%
talking about line six oh
 
05:08:37.788 --> 05:08:37.798 align:start position:0%
no Lang was talking about line eight
 
05:08:40.670 --> 05:08:40.680 align:start position:0%
we're talking about line six
 
05:08:44.628 --> 05:08:44.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:50.470 --> 05:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:50.480 --> 05:08:52.708 align:start position:0%
 
understandable

05:08:52.708 --> 05:08:52.718 align:start position:0%
understandable
 
05:08:52.718 --> 05:08:54.548 align:start position:0%
understandable
no

05:08:54.548 --> 05:08:54.558 align:start position:0%
no
 
05:08:58.750 --> 05:08:58.760 align:start position:0%
35% it just happens to be that um that's
 
05:09:02.590 --> 05:09:02.600 align:start position:0%
35% of 45% right right exactly I can I
 
05:09:04.430 --> 05:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
can tell you with
 
05:09:06.990 --> 05:09:07.000 align:start position:0%
99.9% shorty that he didn't he wasn't
 
05:09:10.390 --> 05:09:10.400 align:start position:0%
talking about that 35% does it matter in
 
05:09:12.708 --> 05:09:12.718 align:start position:0%
the um if we leave it at the governor's
 
05:09:15.670 --> 05:09:15.680 align:start position:0%
number there's going to be a negotiation
 
05:09:17.390 --> 05:09:17.400 align:start position:0%
they'll figure it out we can we can just
 
05:09:21.030 --> 05:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
not make so we can make no comment yeah
 
05:09:23.670 --> 05:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
yeah if that makes sense
 
05:09:26.150 --> 05:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
yeah we can either recommend I I would
 
05:09:27.788 --> 05:09:27.798 align:start position:0%
say right now we can either recommend 32
 
05:09:31.510 --> 05:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
and a half or not recommend anything so
 
05:09:35.310 --> 05:09:35.320 align:start position:0%
so we can't even say that that the
 
05:09:38.868 --> 05:09:38.878 align:start position:0%
majority of us here think that it should
 
05:09:38.878 --> 05:09:41.110 align:start position:0%
majority of us here think that it should
be

05:09:41.110 --> 05:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:09:45.430 --> 05:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
4 I I the problem with that the finance
 
05:09:48.310 --> 05:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
committee is going to change it
 
05:09:51.150 --> 05:09:51.160 align:start position:0%
any this isn't going to stand I don't
 
05:09:52.510 --> 05:09:52.520 align:start position:0%
believe that it's going to stand well I
 
05:09:55.470 --> 05:09:55.480 align:start position:0%
think given that we don't have uh enough
 
05:09:56.628 --> 05:09:56.638 align:start position:0%
people here I think we don't make a
 
05:09:58.628 --> 05:09:58.638 align:start position:0%
recommendation on that number well we're
 
05:09:59.990 --> 05:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
not going to make a recommendation on
 
05:10:02.750 --> 05:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
anything today anyway are we well
 
05:10:04.510 --> 05:10:04.520 align:start position:0%
there's some things we we've agreed to I
 
05:10:06.510 --> 05:10:06.520 align:start position:0%
can make a recommendation on I I asked
 
05:10:08.470 --> 05:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
let me see if I have a response on
 
05:10:10.390 --> 05:10:10.400 align:start position:0%
anything else because we don't have
 
05:10:13.990 --> 05:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
enough people here um unless they'll
 
05:10:17.350 --> 05:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
give us more time I I sent a text asking
 
05:10:19.270 --> 05:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
how much time we have not received a
 
05:10:22.190 --> 05:10:22.200 align:start position:0%
reply um so that's why I want at least
 
05:10:25.030 --> 05:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
get as many positions that we agree on
 
05:10:28.190 --> 05:10:28.200 align:start position:0%
if he says you have to have them by well
 
05:10:29.390 --> 05:10:29.400 align:start position:0%
even if he says you have to have by the
 
05:10:30.670 --> 05:10:30.680 align:start position:0%
end of the week we're out of time
 
05:10:32.430 --> 05:10:32.440 align:start position:0%
because this is the only meeting we have
 
05:10:34.548 --> 05:10:34.558 align:start position:0%
this week could we do um a poll again
 
05:10:36.628 --> 05:10:36.638 align:start position:0%
and just see how many people are fine if
 
05:10:40.510 --> 05:10:40.520 align:start position:0%
we do nothing just so you know
 
05:10:42.270 --> 05:10:42.280 align:start position:0%
so we'll just leave it
 
05:10:46.110 --> 05:10:46.120 align:start position:0%
alone no just this one thing the
 
05:10:49.708 --> 05:10:49.718 align:start position:0%
45% yeah and so our straple isn't a big
 
05:10:51.430 --> 05:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
debate it's that we aren't going to do
 
05:10:53.510 --> 05:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
anything with it at this time we're just
 
05:10:56.350 --> 05:10:56.360 align:start position:0%
leaving it yeah that'll give you backing
 
05:10:57.788 --> 05:10:57.798 align:start position:0%
if people are saying why didn't we pick
 
05:11:03.230 --> 05:11:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:05.230 --> 05:11:05.240 align:start position:0%
okay yeah how many people think we
 
05:11:07.190 --> 05:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
should just leave it as it is because
 
05:11:08.430 --> 05:11:08.440 align:start position:0%
because if we come up with something
 
05:11:11.670 --> 05:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:16.510 --> 05:11:16.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:27.708 --> 05:11:27.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:32.990 --> 05:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:35.670 --> 05:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
not we're passing over
 
05:11:39.230 --> 05:11:39.240 align:start position:0%
it yeah I I I see the confusion but um
 
05:11:40.670 --> 05:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
I'll have to make it clear to finance
 
05:11:42.590 --> 05:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
that we I don't think we have enough
 
05:11:54.390 --> 05:11:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:57.708 --> 05:11:57.718 align:start position:0%
a no there's no point to it because we
 
05:12:01.548 --> 05:12:01.558 align:start position:0%
don't have a a good representation
 
05:12:04.150 --> 05:12:04.160 align:start position:0%
here same
 
05:12:06.310 --> 05:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
represent I think we've lost another two
 
05:12:07.470 --> 05:12:07.480 align:start position:0%
or three
 
05:12:10.670 --> 05:12:10.680 align:start position:0%
people we already
 
05:12:12.628 --> 05:12:12.638 align:start position:0%
we already voted to go along with
 
05:12:23.830 --> 05:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:27.708 --> 05:12:27.718 align:start position:0%
majority uh may make
 
05:12:30.350 --> 05:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
it I don't believe it'll stay at
 
05:12:30.360 --> 05:12:32.628 align:start position:0%
it I don't believe it'll stay at
45%

05:12:32.628 --> 05:12:32.638 align:start position:0%
45%
 
05:12:35.670 --> 05:12:35.680 align:start position:0%
um this may make it impossible to do
 
05:12:39.830 --> 05:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:46.030 --> 05:12:46.040 align:start position:0%
uh but there is the no I mean line 10 uh
 
05:12:47.510 --> 05:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
because no matter what the percentages
 
05:12:49.030 --> 05:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
line 10 is
 
05:12:52.070 --> 05:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
still well no line do something
 
05:12:55.270 --> 05:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
different with it which would be three
 
05:12:57.390 --> 05:12:57.400 align:start position:0%
licensed charitable organizations or
 
05:12:59.708 --> 05:12:59.718 align:start position:0%
four licensed charitable organizations
 
05:13:03.868 --> 05:13:03.878 align:start position:0%
depending on how big that casino is so
 
05:13:05.750 --> 05:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
maybe we should say up to there would be
 
05:13:08.430 --> 05:13:08.440 align:start position:0%
more Charities that would be able to get
 
05:13:09.868 --> 05:13:09.878 align:start position:0%
in on this
 
05:13:12.070 --> 05:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
right that's that's fine so right now it
 
05:13:15.150 --> 05:13:15.160 align:start position:0%
says well that would require increasing
 
05:13:18.150 --> 05:13:18.160 align:start position:0%
if if we leave it at 45% if we increase
 
05:13:21.750 --> 05:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
this to two uh two to four uh change it
 
05:13:24.190 --> 05:13:24.200 align:start position:0%
from two to four no I wouldn't change it
 
05:13:26.350 --> 05:13:26.360 align:start position:0%
to four because if you're a small small
 
05:13:29.230 --> 05:13:29.240 align:start position:0%
Casino you can't do four how about uh so
 
05:13:30.510 --> 05:13:30.520 align:start position:0%
it looks like it's already two at a
 
05:13:32.190 --> 05:13:32.200 align:start position:0%
minimum so why don't we say much
 
05:13:37.230 --> 05:13:37.240 align:start position:0%
contract with two to four licensed or
 
05:13:39.948 --> 05:13:39.958 align:start position:0%
yeah that would be fine if if we're
 
05:13:41.350 --> 05:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
leaving it at
 
05:13:43.990 --> 05:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
45% in
 
05:13:47.990 --> 05:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
again 45% is the gross that's the that's
 
05:13:51.510 --> 05:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
the 100% that we distributed
 
05:13:53.948 --> 05:13:53.958 align:start position:0%
right I don't know I don't think the two
 
05:13:56.310 --> 05:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
are tied together I mean yes they are
 
05:13:59.350 --> 05:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
because the 45% yes there's more money
 
05:14:03.868 --> 05:14:03.878 align:start position:0%
if at 45% that's the point but but from
 
05:14:06.030 --> 05:14:06.040 align:start position:0%
what director McIntyre is saying the
 
05:14:09.350 --> 05:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
amount of money coming in on on some at
 
05:14:11.788 --> 05:14:11.798 align:start position:0%
some of these casinos now is markedly
 
05:14:16.070 --> 05:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
increased so whether it's 45% or 32% or
 
05:14:17.990 --> 05:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
whatever it sounds like more money's
 
05:14:19.708 --> 05:14:19.718 align:start position:0%
coming in don't forget HHR is what
 
05:14:22.750 --> 05:14:22.760 align:start position:0%
currently at
 
05:14:25.670 --> 05:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
25% and the more Charities that are
 
05:14:28.830 --> 05:14:28.840 align:start position:0%
contracted the less each charity
 
05:14:32.310 --> 05:14:32.320 align:start position:0%
gets yeah but some of these big casinos
 
05:14:35.708 --> 05:14:35.718 align:start position:0%
get it come and tell us not to let
 
05:14:37.070 --> 05:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
05:14:40.590 --> 05:14:40.600 align:start position:0%
in I would Rec that sounds familiar so
 
05:14:42.190 --> 05:14:42.200 align:start position:0%
how about we say two to four is that
 
05:14:42.200 --> 05:14:43.190 align:start position:0%
how about we say two to four is that
represent

05:14:43.190 --> 05:14:43.200 align:start position:0%
represent
 
05:14:46.990 --> 05:14:47.000 align:start position:0%
elberger yeah at at the risk of needing
 
05:14:49.948 --> 05:14:49.958 align:start position:0%
to go out wearing a a suit of armor to
 
05:14:52.868 --> 05:14:52.878 align:start position:0%
keep various projectiles from getting to
 
05:14:55.628 --> 05:14:55.638 align:start position:0%
me I honestly believe that the casino
 
05:14:58.190 --> 05:14:58.200 align:start position:0%
should have no authority over who's
 
05:15:00.230 --> 05:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
getting the money in the way of
 
05:15:02.708 --> 05:15:02.718 align:start position:0%
Charities we have what something like
 
05:15:06.548 --> 05:15:06.558 align:start position:0%
9,000 charities in the state and 900 of
 
05:15:08.470 --> 05:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
them are getting money through
 
05:15:11.110 --> 05:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming yeah so it's so being
 
05:15:13.070 --> 05:15:13.080 align:start position:0%
on the commission it was recognized as a
 
05:15:15.670 --> 05:15:15.680 align:start position:0%
problem that needs to be solved so my
 
05:15:19.350 --> 05:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
suggestion would be that the casinos get
 
05:15:23.110 --> 05:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
no authority over who gets the money
 
05:15:26.230 --> 05:15:26.240 align:start position:0%
that the commission determine a system
 
05:15:28.110 --> 05:15:28.120 align:start position:0%
for how the money gets
 
05:15:30.590 --> 05:15:30.600 align:start position:0%
distributed which may include things
 
05:15:33.470 --> 05:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
like everybody gets some small
 
05:15:36.430 --> 05:15:36.440 align:start position:0%
percentage or we take turns over the
 
05:15:38.270 --> 05:15:38.280 align:start position:0%
course of several years but that would
 
05:15:39.990 --> 05:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
be the commit
 
05:15:43.430 --> 05:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
decision it should not be left to the
 
05:15:46.788 --> 05:15:46.798 align:start position:0%
casinos because they don't know the
 
05:15:49.628 --> 05:15:49.638 align:start position:0%
people or the or the Charities that they
 
05:15:52.150 --> 05:15:52.160 align:start position:0%
don't know and those Charities that they
 
05:15:55.470 --> 05:15:55.480 align:start position:0%
don't know get nothing right no it is a
 
05:15:56.910 --> 05:15:56.920 align:start position:0%
problem that's why and I would agree
 
05:15:59.548 --> 05:15:59.558 align:start position:0%
100% with you uh representative but is
 
05:16:00.830 --> 05:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
this the time and the place for it
 
05:16:02.270 --> 05:16:02.280 align:start position:0%
that's what I just don't know that's
 
05:16:03.788 --> 05:16:03.798 align:start position:0%
that's the issue because if we take it
 
05:16:05.270 --> 05:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
away if we say let's get rid of it they
 
05:16:06.990 --> 05:16:07.000 align:start position:0%
can't pick well who's now the Charities
 
05:16:10.230 --> 05:16:10.240 align:start position:0%
don't get anything because then maybe
 
05:16:13.230 --> 05:16:13.240 align:start position:0%
add at the end of this until such time
 
05:16:14.868 --> 05:16:14.878 align:start position:0%
as the commission makes its
 
05:16:16.510 --> 05:16:16.520 align:start position:0%
determination about how the funds should
 
05:16:19.110 --> 05:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
be distributed so leave it until the
 
05:16:21.788 --> 05:16:21.798 align:start position:0%
commission figures it out and maybe give
 
05:16:25.910 --> 05:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
a and I'm sorry with the maybe but um
 
05:16:27.548 --> 05:16:27.558 align:start position:0%
the commission is supposed to be
 
05:16:30.430 --> 05:16:30.440 align:start position:0%
authorized or is authorized now has it
 
05:16:34.070 --> 05:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
been um has the membership been
 
05:16:34.080 --> 05:16:35.670 align:start position:0%
been um has the membership been
determined

05:16:35.670 --> 05:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
determined
 
05:16:38.990 --> 05:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
no no because the commission the last
 
05:16:40.470 --> 05:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
commission just finished up their work
 
05:16:43.150 --> 05:16:43.160 align:start position:0%
with the report the new commission uh
 
05:16:47.230 --> 05:16:47.240 align:start position:0%
still has to be appointed um I think I
 
05:16:49.948 --> 05:16:49.958 align:start position:0%
think um so as I said it's already
 
05:16:52.190 --> 05:16:52.200 align:start position:0%
recognized as a
 
05:16:54.510 --> 05:16:54.520 align:start position:0%
problem it hasn't no it hasn't finished
 
05:16:55.910 --> 05:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
it hasn't gone through the Senate yet
 
05:16:58.070 --> 05:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
yeah so but the thing is it's recognized
 
05:16:59.590 --> 05:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
as an issue it's written up in the last
 
05:17:01.030 --> 05:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
report as something that needs to be
 
05:17:04.230 --> 05:17:04.240 align:start position:0%
looked at so I think we've got to just
 
05:17:06.590 --> 05:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
be very simple here the fact that we
 
05:17:08.948 --> 05:17:08.958 align:start position:0%
don't say what you're suggesting uh repr
 
05:17:11.788 --> 05:17:11.798 align:start position:0%
elberger doesn't this is still has to be
 
05:17:13.948 --> 05:17:13.958 align:start position:0%
addressed because even if we say two to
 
05:17:16.750 --> 05:17:16.760 align:start position:0%
four there's still the problem that's
 
05:17:19.190 --> 05:17:19.200 align:start position:0%
still not going to cover all so it it's
 
05:17:20.510 --> 05:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
just a matter of do we change this at
 
05:17:22.750 --> 05:17:22.760 align:start position:0%
all do we leave it as two do we say two
 
05:17:25.628 --> 05:17:25.638 align:start position:0%
to four uh I think we give yeah I think
 
05:17:28.590 --> 05:17:28.600 align:start position:0%
let's give the option of of more and yes
 
05:17:30.310 --> 05:17:30.320 align:start position:0%
the casino is going to decide who they
 
05:17:33.470 --> 05:17:33.480 align:start position:0%
are but at least it it's something for
 
05:17:34.548 --> 05:17:34.558 align:start position:0%
now I
 
05:17:36.948 --> 05:17:36.958 align:start position:0%
mean it's not going to be if we just
 
05:17:39.708 --> 05:17:39.718 align:start position:0%
take away that power then then charity
 
05:17:43.670 --> 05:17:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:47.070 --> 05:17:47.080 align:start position:0%
now does that make sense repres yeah
 
05:17:50.750 --> 05:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
yeah I remember this I think
 
05:17:54.708 --> 05:17:54.718 align:start position:0%
I asked uh representative Ames about
 
05:17:56.868 --> 05:17:56.878 align:start position:0%
this with this
 
05:17:59.788 --> 05:17:59.798 align:start position:0%
commission and wanted to get an answer
 
05:17:59.798 --> 05:18:01.990 align:start position:0%
commission and wanted to get an answer
from

05:18:01.990 --> 05:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:18:07.190 --> 05:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
about this very question about how long
 
05:18:11.390 --> 05:18:11.400 align:start position:0%
we'd be waiting to hear about a
 
05:18:13.868 --> 05:18:13.878 align:start position:0%
recommendation on this
 
05:18:16.670 --> 05:18:16.680 align:start position:0%
so to mess around with this right now
 
05:18:18.030 --> 05:18:18.040 align:start position:0%
and to your
 
05:18:22.470 --> 05:18:22.480 align:start position:0%
point no no charity gets anything is
 
05:18:24.830 --> 05:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
danger I this is
 
05:18:27.390 --> 05:18:27.400 align:start position:0%
we're this has been very frustrating for
 
05:18:29.788 --> 05:18:29.798 align:start position:0%
me this whole
 
05:18:29.798 --> 05:18:31.390 align:start position:0%
me this whole
thing

05:18:31.390 --> 05:18:31.400 align:start position:0%
thing
 
05:18:33.670 --> 05:18:33.680 align:start position:0%
uh I don't know how to move it forward
 
05:18:36.590 --> 05:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
but I at two to four put something in
 
05:18:39.548 --> 05:18:39.558 align:start position:0%
there now at least show the show show
 
05:18:41.868 --> 05:18:41.878 align:start position:0%
that we're interested in seeing make a
 
05:18:43.510 --> 05:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
statement somewhere that we want to see
 
05:18:46.868 --> 05:18:46.878 align:start position:0%
more uh Charities get this especially if
 
05:18:48.110 --> 05:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a lot more money
 
05:18:51.150 --> 05:18:51.160 align:start position:0%
coming in according to the uh
 
05:18:54.390 --> 05:18:54.400 align:start position:0%
director uh whoa I think we're in pretty
 
05:18:58.030 --> 05:18:58.040 align:start position:0%
good shape to say that yeah my opinion
 
05:18:59.670 --> 05:18:59.680 align:start position:0%
especially as that means that the
 
05:19:01.430 --> 05:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
Charities that are already in the
 
05:19:03.830 --> 05:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
pipeline are going to be getting a
 
05:19:06.470 --> 05:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
windfall and the people the Charities
 
05:19:08.708 --> 05:19:08.718 align:start position:0%
that don't get anything will continue
 
05:19:11.910 --> 05:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
continue to get nothing there's no
 
05:19:16.390 --> 05:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
improvement for them and I don't know
 
05:19:18.110 --> 05:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
how to make a difference and I agree
 
05:19:20.510 --> 05:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
with you it's it's messy saying that
 
05:19:22.070 --> 05:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
they don't get to make the decisions at
 
05:19:25.110 --> 05:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
this point means nobody gets anything I
 
05:19:27.830 --> 05:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
I just would I don't know if it's
 
05:19:30.990 --> 05:19:31.000 align:start position:0%
possible to say that there needs this
 
05:19:34.788 --> 05:19:34.798 align:start position:0%
the gaming commission or
 
05:19:39.788 --> 05:19:39.798 align:start position:0%
the needs to make up its mind about how
 
05:19:42.070 --> 05:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
the distribution will be made and the
 
05:19:44.150 --> 05:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
selection of Charities will be made
 
05:19:47.230 --> 05:19:47.240 align:start position:0%
within x amount of time and if not then
 
05:19:49.670 --> 05:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
we will designate some other group to
 
05:19:51.628 --> 05:19:51.638 align:start position:0%
make that decision for them well it's so
 
05:19:53.548 --> 05:19:53.558 align:start position:0%
it's in the it's in the the the last
 
05:19:55.470 --> 05:19:55.480 align:start position:0%
report that that needs to be done is
 
05:19:58.030 --> 05:19:58.040 align:start position:0%
there a timeline there's not a timeline
 
05:20:00.830 --> 05:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
so the other option don't forget the
 
05:20:02.708 --> 05:20:02.718 align:start position:0%
other option is if you can put together
 
05:20:06.628 --> 05:20:06.638 align:start position:0%
a bill uh that you feel like solves the
 
05:20:08.190 --> 05:20:08.200 align:start position:0%
problem or part of the problem then then
 
05:20:10.030 --> 05:20:10.040 align:start position:0%
submit the bill because it'll probably
 
05:20:13.150 --> 05:20:13.160 align:start position:0%
get heard before the commission makes a
 
05:20:15.948 --> 05:20:15.958 align:start position:0%
recommendation so so for now I it sounds
 
05:20:18.110 --> 05:20:18.120 align:start position:0%
like the consensus is two to four no
 
05:20:20.230 --> 05:20:20.240 align:start position:0%
didn't didn't representative aim submit
 
05:20:22.910 --> 05:20:22.920 align:start position:0%
a bill on not to exceed
 
05:20:26.510 --> 05:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
50,000 for he was that his bill I think
 
05:20:28.868 --> 05:20:28.878 align:start position:0%
it was yeah yeah we killed it
 
05:20:31.510 --> 05:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
yeah just the
 
05:20:34.030 --> 05:20:34.040 align:start position:0%
point it didn't really yeah we felt like
 
05:20:39.590 --> 05:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:42.830 --> 05:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
I think we bipartisan and get Langs
 
05:20:45.750 --> 05:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
input it was a very bipartisan vote that
 
05:20:48.430 --> 05:20:48.440 align:start position:0%
uh the K I like what you're saying two
 
05:20:50.868 --> 05:20:50.878 align:start position:0%
to four at least even a minimum I'm good
 
05:20:52.510 --> 05:20:52.520 align:start position:0%
with two to four I think it makes sense
 
05:20:54.030 --> 05:20:54.040 align:start position:0%
I think that's Mak sense anybody object
 
05:20:59.510 --> 05:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
to two to four no okay all right good
 
05:21:04.830 --> 05:21:04.840 align:start position:0%
okay okay so what's next is um then on
 
05:21:06.990 --> 05:21:07.000 align:start position:0%
line 13 and
 
05:21:10.230 --> 05:21:10.240 align:start position:0%
14 13 and 14 uh the governor is
 
05:21:12.510 --> 05:21:12.520 align:start position:0%
suggesting 50% go to the education trust
 
05:21:16.230 --> 05:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
fund 50% to the general fund uh repes
 
05:21:19.390 --> 05:21:19.400 align:start position:0%
represent of Lang Senator Lang was was I
 
05:21:21.628 --> 05:21:21.638 align:start position:0%
guess what what did he do he did 25% to
 
05:21:24.750 --> 05:21:24.760 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund and 25% to the
 
05:21:27.628 --> 05:21:27.638 align:start position:0%
to a I don't know a fund that would help
 
05:21:30.590 --> 05:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
uh that would go back to the communities
 
05:21:32.830 --> 05:21:32.840 align:start position:0%
for property tax relief that that's the
 
05:21:35.150 --> 05:21:35.160 align:start position:0%
discussion I between the two bodies I
 
05:21:38.590 --> 05:21:38.600 align:start position:0%
like 5050 it'll pass the house that way
 
05:21:40.750 --> 05:21:40.760 align:start position:0%
represent elberger at at the risk of
 
05:21:43.910 --> 05:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
going back to what is an unsolvable
 
05:21:46.948 --> 05:21:46.958 align:start position:0%
issue and I right now and I recognize it
 
05:21:50.948 --> 05:21:50.958 align:start position:0%
I wonder if one approach in terms of how
 
05:21:50.958 --> 05:21:52.230 align:start position:0%
I wonder if one approach in terms of how
many

05:21:52.230 --> 05:21:52.240 align:start position:0%
many
 
05:21:56.350 --> 05:21:56.360 align:start position:0%
Charities a uh facility a len has to
 
05:21:58.830 --> 05:21:58.840 align:start position:0%
contract with might be approached in
 
05:22:03.708 --> 05:22:03.718 align:start position:0%
terms of the size the the the revenue
 
05:22:08.070 --> 05:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
that a facility has so that smaller
 
05:22:10.548 --> 05:22:10.558 align:start position:0%
Casino knows have fewer Charities that
 
05:22:14.190 --> 05:22:14.200 align:start position:0%
they are required to support where
 
05:22:18.390 --> 05:22:18.400 align:start position:0%
larger ones are required to support more
 
05:22:19.910 --> 05:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
and I'm playing with numbers I'm making
 
05:22:21.270 --> 05:22:21.280 align:start position:0%
them up because I know they're wrong
 
05:22:22.670 --> 05:22:22.680 align:start position:0%
well no I I agree with the principle of
 
05:22:24.470 --> 05:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
what you're saying I just don't know how
 
05:22:27.590 --> 05:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
we decide like if if we want to say up
 
05:22:29.868 --> 05:22:29.878 align:start position:0%
to two if it's this but if you're over
 
05:22:31.548 --> 05:22:31.558 align:start position:0%
this Revenue then it's got to be three
 
05:22:33.070 --> 05:22:33.080 align:start position:0%
and then if you're over this it's four
 
05:22:35.708 --> 05:22:35.718 align:start position:0%
but I don't I don't without further
 
05:22:38.030 --> 05:22:38.040 align:start position:0%
study right now we don't have time on
 
05:22:39.670 --> 05:22:39.680 align:start position:0%
our side I'm not sure how we figure that
 
05:22:43.350 --> 05:22:43.360 align:start position:0%
out can I can I ask uh representative
 
05:22:46.230 --> 05:22:46.240 align:start position:0%
mmes he has the you know 50% going to
 
05:22:49.150 --> 05:22:49.160 align:start position:0%
the ETF 50% to group two is group two
 
05:22:50.628 --> 05:22:50.638 align:start position:0%
basically part of the general fund is
 
05:22:51.788 --> 05:22:51.798 align:start position:0%
that what that
 
05:22:53.948 --> 05:22:53.958 align:start position:0%
means uh I don't know where that is
 
05:23:02.470 --> 05:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:04.628 --> 05:23:04.638 align:start position:0%
thought I was just trying to look at his
 
05:23:08.070 --> 05:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
hp2 breakdown and compare that to this
 
05:23:10.708 --> 05:23:10.718 align:start position:0%
HP to line 13 and
 
05:23:14.788 --> 05:23:14.798 align:start position:0%
14 the one that he handed out that it's
 
05:23:17.470 --> 05:23:17.480 align:start position:0%
this yeah does she have his is different
 
05:23:19.110 --> 05:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
he broke it down differently than the
 
05:23:19.120 --> 05:23:20.868 align:start position:0%
he broke it down differently than the
governor

05:23:20.868 --> 05:23:20.878 align:start position:0%
governor
 
05:23:23.708 --> 05:23:23.718 align:start position:0%
yeah so is it she's paying group two
 
05:23:27.590 --> 05:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:29.788 --> 05:23:29.798 align:start position:0%
money I
 
05:23:38.708 --> 05:23:38.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:44.948 --> 05:23:44.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:44.958 --> 05:23:54.350 align:start position:0%
 
another

05:23:54.350 --> 05:23:54.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:02.350 --> 05:24:02.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:05.708 --> 05:24:05.718 align:start position:0%
don't is if you look at the the
 
05:24:12.948 --> 05:24:12.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:16.628 --> 05:24:16.638 align:start position:0%
I can only assume that me that's right
 
05:24:18.628 --> 05:24:18.638 align:start position:0%
what's that's I agree too I'm just
 
05:24:20.270 --> 05:24:20.280 align:start position:0%
saying the 50% jump in front of that
 
05:24:23.030 --> 05:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
group two there I'm assuming that's
 
05:24:25.510 --> 05:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
based on based on the
 
05:24:28.628 --> 05:24:28.638 align:start position:0%
language this
 
05:24:32.110 --> 05:24:32.120 align:start position:0%
is this isn't even right is it hb2
 
05:24:35.670 --> 05:24:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:38.788 --> 05:24:38.798 align:start position:0%
5050 I'm not sure the Govern oh this
 
05:24:42.230 --> 05:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
yeah had these trust fund group two oh
 
05:24:45.990 --> 05:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
he's putting all in group two 28 plus
 
05:24:48.230 --> 05:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
15 is
 
05:24:51.510 --> 05:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
um we're talking to
 
05:25:01.390 --> 05:25:01.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:05.548 --> 05:25:05.558 align:start position:0%
7 oh yeah right and just the 5050 split
 
05:25:08.510 --> 05:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
you know if you look at represent so
 
05:25:10.830 --> 05:25:10.840 align:start position:0%
looks like his supposed between the ETF
 
05:25:12.670 --> 05:25:12.680 align:start position:0%
and group two I'm just wondering if if
 
05:25:15.390 --> 05:25:15.400 align:start position:0%
he me group two to be general fund or
 
05:25:15.400 --> 05:25:30.310 align:start position:0%
he me group two to be general fund or
that

05:25:30.310 --> 05:25:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:35.190 --> 05:25:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:40.150 --> 05:25:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:43.868 --> 05:25:43.878 align:start position:0%
yeah represent y for our purposes
 
05:25:48.150 --> 05:25:48.160 align:start position:0%
today rather than say 5050 split we
 
05:25:50.350 --> 05:25:50.360 align:start position:0%
should recommend to finance the
 
05:25:53.390 --> 05:25:53.400 align:start position:0%
consideration be given to
 
05:25:57.910 --> 05:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:02.110 --> 05:26:02.120 align:start position:0%
blah into the into the distribution
 
05:26:04.830 --> 05:26:04.840 align:start position:0%
funds like we just did what was the last
 
05:26:08.948 --> 05:26:08.958 align:start position:0%
bill we just did where we the phology
 
05:26:11.430 --> 05:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
we did earlier here
 
05:26:14.470 --> 05:26:14.480 align:start position:0%
today at the beginning something and
 
05:26:17.628 --> 05:26:17.638 align:start position:0%
just uh uh considering
 
05:26:20.910 --> 05:26:20.920 align:start position:0%
readjusting the distribution to
 
05:26:26.190 --> 05:26:26.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:30.190 --> 05:26:30.200 align:start position:0%
two um retirement
 
05:26:34.070 --> 05:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:36.350 --> 05:26:36.360 align:start position:0%
that general fund is opposed to group
 
05:26:37.788 --> 05:26:37.798 align:start position:0%
two I mean because I guess your general
 
05:26:39.628 --> 05:26:39.638 align:start position:0%
fund it's just a catch all for anything
 
05:26:41.030 --> 05:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
that the governor wants to or the
 
05:26:43.470 --> 05:26:43.480 align:start position:0%
finance wants to put it right yeah but
 
05:26:46.868 --> 05:26:46.878 align:start position:0%
if we if we specify it in here it has to
 
05:26:46.878 --> 05:26:48.150 align:start position:0%
if we if we specify it in here it has to
go

05:26:48.150 --> 05:26:48.160 align:start position:0%
go
 
05:26:50.350 --> 05:26:50.360 align:start position:0%
there further on we're setting up a
 
05:26:52.270 --> 05:26:52.280 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund for that do we want to do
 
05:26:52.280 --> 05:26:54.430 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund for that do we want to do
that

05:26:54.430 --> 05:26:54.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:26:54.440 --> 05:26:56.708 align:start position:0%
that
though

05:26:56.708 --> 05:26:56.718 align:start position:0%
though
 
05:26:56.718 --> 05:27:00.470 align:start position:0%
though
right

05:27:00.470 --> 05:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:02.350 --> 05:27:02.360 align:start position:0%
correct right but should we be getting
 
05:27:04.310 --> 05:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
into the weeds to specifically say we
 
05:27:07.788 --> 05:27:07.798 align:start position:0%
want to go to group two I mean we should
 
05:27:07.798 --> 05:27:10.150 align:start position:0%
want to go to group two I mean we should
okay

05:27:10.150 --> 05:27:10.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:27:13.470 --> 05:27:13.480 align:start position:0%
well we already said oh group two yeah
 
05:27:18.708 --> 05:27:18.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:22.390 --> 05:27:22.400 align:start position:0%
okay so there is a conflict between what
 
05:27:27.390 --> 05:27:27.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:30.030 --> 05:27:30.040 align:start position:0%
turnic there's a conflict between what
 
05:27:34.948 --> 05:27:34.958 align:start position:0%
the governor said in page
 
05:27:42.868 --> 05:27:42.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:48.270 --> 05:27:48.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:51.290 --> 05:27:51.300 align:start position:0%
think yeah and what she's
 
05:27:51.300 --> 05:27:53.430 align:start position:0%
think yeah and what she's
[Music]

05:27:53.430 --> 05:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:27:58.470 --> 05:27:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:02.990 --> 05:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
72 isn't there or no I guess no those
 
05:28:05.548 --> 05:28:05.558 align:start position:0%
are different those are different things
 
05:28:09.590 --> 05:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
yeah um yeah she doesn't get into the
 
05:28:19.510 --> 05:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:19.520 --> 05:28:24.030 align:start position:0%
 
there

05:28:24.030 --> 05:28:24.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:28.190 --> 05:28:28.200 align:start position:0%
yeah but that would according
 
05:28:33.430 --> 05:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
to to our executive director talk um
 
05:28:37.070 --> 05:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
compensate some in the education trust
 
05:28:43.628 --> 05:28:43.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:46.548 --> 05:28:46.558 align:start position:0%
fund and again we're only making
 
05:28:49.990 --> 05:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
recommendations right exactly well given
 
05:28:52.548 --> 05:28:52.558 align:start position:0%
the recommendation in terms
 
05:28:55.670 --> 05:28:55.680 align:start position:0%
of the governor's proposal in
 
05:28:58.708 --> 05:28:58.718 align:start position:0%
hb2 um and this is probably not going to
 
05:28:59.910 --> 05:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
fly either but I'll make the
 
05:29:02.350 --> 05:29:02.360 align:start position:0%
recommendation I think uh the
 
05:29:05.030 --> 05:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
distribution of the education trust fund
 
05:29:09.070 --> 05:29:09.080 align:start position:0%
uh on lines 13 and 14 should be
 
05:29:12.150 --> 05:29:12.160 align:start position:0%
higher because in the in the BPT section
 
05:29:14.310 --> 05:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
on page 72 we're
 
05:29:16.788 --> 05:29:16.798 align:start position:0%
cutting the share that's going from the
 
05:29:19.788 --> 05:29:19.798 align:start position:0%
BPT to the education trust fund well
 
05:29:21.750 --> 05:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
when you say 13 and 14 how can they be
 
05:29:24.910 --> 05:29:24.920 align:start position:0%
higher they're 50 and 50 well so instead
 
05:29:27.070 --> 05:29:27.080 align:start position:0%
of saying 5050 I'm talking about like
 
05:29:32.788 --> 05:29:32.798 align:start position:0%
6040 oh oh okay refer P2 right so what I
 
05:29:35.788 --> 05:29:35.798 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying Mr chairman is on on
 
05:29:38.628 --> 05:29:38.638 align:start position:0%
page 42 line 13
 
05:29:42.990 --> 05:29:43.000 align:start position:0%
and 14 instead of 5050 I would say 60 to
 
05:29:47.070 --> 05:29:47.080 align:start position:0%
the ETF and 40 to the general fund
 
05:29:49.590 --> 05:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
because later on her
 
05:29:51.788 --> 05:29:51.798 align:start position:0%
recommendation I'm not really happy with
 
05:29:55.150 --> 05:29:55.160 align:start position:0%
either but she's proposing to cut the
 
05:29:57.830 --> 05:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
share of the BPT that goes to the
 
05:30:01.030 --> 05:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
education trust fund and I'm I'm hoping
 
05:30:04.430 --> 05:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
that the director is correct and that
 
05:30:08.430 --> 05:30:08.440 align:start position:0%
the uh almost $100 million that is being
 
05:30:11.110 --> 05:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
cut from the education trust fund
 
05:30:12.910 --> 05:30:12.920 align:start position:0%
according to the distribution will be
 
05:30:15.110 --> 05:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
made up by additional slot machine
 
05:30:19.110 --> 05:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
Revenue um my plan B as representative
 
05:30:22.830 --> 05:30:22.840 align:start position:0%
Elber Berker asked earlier my plan B is
 
05:30:26.190 --> 05:30:26.200 align:start position:0%
if we make this 60% perhaps we'll close
 
05:30:26.200 --> 05:30:29.590 align:start position:0%
if we make this 60% perhaps we'll close
that

05:30:29.590 --> 05:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:32.910 --> 05:30:32.920 align:start position:0%
Gap but I think we've got we've got a
 
05:30:36.830 --> 05:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
history of Court decisions that suggest
 
05:30:40.190 --> 05:30:40.200 align:start position:0%
don't suggest that that that tell us
 
05:30:43.310 --> 05:30:43.320 align:start position:0%
that we are we have not been doing our
 
05:30:45.510 --> 05:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
duty according to funding the education
 
05:30:47.548 --> 05:30:47.558 align:start position:0%
funding educa public school education in
 
05:30:50.670 --> 05:30:50.680 align:start position:0%
this state according to the Constitution
 
05:30:53.230 --> 05:30:53.240 align:start position:0%
um we may well have in the next few
 
05:30:56.548 --> 05:30:56.558 align:start position:0%
weeks or months more decisions that tell
 
05:31:01.510 --> 05:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
us the same thing in which case um we're
 
05:31:04.868 --> 05:31:04.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:07.590 --> 05:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
someplace well it may not be but at
 
05:31:11.590 --> 05:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
least it's a down payment I
 
05:31:11.600 --> 05:31:13.230 align:start position:0%
least it's a down payment I
have

05:31:13.230 --> 05:31:13.240 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:31:16.310 --> 05:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
sorry anyway that's my opening bid Mr
 
05:31:19.590 --> 05:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
okay repres S I absolutely want more
 
05:31:22.230 --> 05:31:22.240 align:start position:0%
money for the educational trust fund but
 
05:31:23.628 --> 05:31:23.638 align:start position:0%
I think there are a lot of bills and
 
05:31:25.788 --> 05:31:25.798 align:start position:0%
things mixed in at this point including
 
05:31:28.470 --> 05:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
a committee focused on this and so I'm
 
05:31:30.670 --> 05:31:30.680 align:start position:0%
not sure making a small change in this
 
05:31:32.788 --> 05:31:32.798 align:start position:0%
section is going to really have an
 
05:31:35.350 --> 05:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
impact wish it would but there's just
 
05:31:38.310 --> 05:31:38.320 align:start position:0%
too many other things going on
 
05:31:39.548 --> 05:31:39.558 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a good point there is an
 
05:31:41.830 --> 05:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
education funding
 
05:31:41.840 --> 05:31:43.868 align:start position:0%
education funding
committee

05:31:43.868 --> 05:31:43.878 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:31:46.990 --> 05:31:47.000 align:start position:0%
um well and I don't know that we can I
 
05:31:48.430 --> 05:31:48.440 align:start position:0%
mean it's not a bad suggestion I just
 
05:31:49.590 --> 05:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
05:31:53.470 --> 05:31:53.480 align:start position:0%
that I mean again as I understand it
 
05:31:55.070 --> 05:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
we're not going to vote on this we're
 
05:31:57.788 --> 05:31:57.798 align:start position:0%
not we're not making right this is not a
 
05:32:00.788 --> 05:32:00.798 align:start position:0%
formal vote right so the best that we
 
05:32:04.110 --> 05:32:04.120 align:start position:0%
can do in this committee I believe is to
 
05:32:06.948 --> 05:32:06.958 align:start position:0%
perhaps send a message to at least the
 
05:32:10.150 --> 05:32:10.160 align:start position:0%
finance committee if not the house that
 
05:32:14.510 --> 05:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
this is what we think um it's symbolic
 
05:32:17.150 --> 05:32:17.160 align:start position:0%
at best and while it may not solve the
 
05:32:19.990 --> 05:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
problem and it it it doesn't have the
 
05:32:23.150 --> 05:32:23.160 align:start position:0%
effect of a committee recommendation and
 
05:32:27.350 --> 05:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
a floor vote um I do think
 
05:32:30.270 --> 05:32:30.280 align:start position:0%
that I for one and I think others on
 
05:32:33.230 --> 05:32:33.240 align:start position:0%
this committee share this view that we
 
05:32:36.190 --> 05:32:36.200 align:start position:0%
should be making that statement that we
 
05:32:37.990 --> 05:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
need to we need to do a better job a
 
05:32:38.000 --> 05:32:39.868 align:start position:0%
need to we need to do a better job a
funding

05:32:39.868 --> 05:32:39.878 align:start position:0%
funding
 
05:32:47.070 --> 05:32:47.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:47.080 --> 05:32:52.390 align:start position:0%
 
problem

05:32:52.390 --> 05:32:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:57.190 --> 05:32:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:57.200 --> 05:32:59.270 align:start position:0%
 
new

05:32:59.270 --> 05:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
new
 
05:33:04.350 --> 05:33:04.360 align:start position:0%
yes Brier I I I get um I get the
 
05:33:06.310 --> 05:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
education funding thing but I think
 
05:33:09.390 --> 05:33:09.400 align:start position:0%
where this is Trail um
 
05:33:13.030 --> 05:33:13.040 align:start position:0%
House Bill too um I don't know I don't
 
05:33:15.750 --> 05:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
know if we should be messing with those
 
05:33:19.430 --> 05:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
percentages okay because the J we have
 
05:33:20.750 --> 05:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
the problem with the education fund but
 
05:33:22.390 --> 05:33:22.400 align:start position:0%
we're also going to have a problem
 
05:33:24.868 --> 05:33:24.878 align:start position:0%
funding General government with the
 
05:33:29.510 --> 05:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:29.520 --> 05:33:33.430 align:start position:0%
 
too

05:33:33.430 --> 05:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:36.868 --> 05:33:36.878 align:start position:0%
yeah uh represent elme you had a no
 
05:33:38.868 --> 05:33:38.878 align:start position:0%
that's about
 
05:33:52.590 --> 05:33:52.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:56.910 --> 05:33:56.920 align:start position:0%
too all right so
 
05:34:03.230 --> 05:34:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:06.708 --> 05:34:06.718 align:start position:0%
oversight represent elberger yeah the
 
05:34:10.470 --> 05:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
the one answer to the revenue issue is
 
05:34:13.990 --> 05:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:14.000 --> 05:34:18.230 align:start position:0%
 
further

05:34:18.230 --> 05:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:23.270 --> 05:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
thank okay um so I think uh we are uh a
 
05:34:25.948 --> 05:34:25.958 align:start position:0%
little bit of an impass on that 50/50
 
05:34:30.030 --> 05:34:30.040 align:start position:0%
right now I think we just leave it
 
05:34:32.548 --> 05:34:32.558 align:start position:0%
um this this section that we're looking
 
05:34:35.150 --> 05:34:35.160 align:start position:0%
at right now ends at line 21 is there
 
05:34:37.070 --> 05:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
anything else that anyone has wants to
 
05:34:39.150 --> 05:34:39.160 align:start position:0%
talk about within that
 
05:34:39.160 --> 05:34:41.470 align:start position:0%
talk about within that
realm

05:34:41.470 --> 05:34:41.480 align:start position:0%
realm
 
05:34:47.990 --> 05:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:53.230 --> 05:34:53.240 align:start position:0%
180 there the cuts in in 180 and 181 on
 
05:34:57.230 --> 05:34:57.240 align:start position:0%
on page 72 I'm not to 72 yet oh you
 
05:35:03.110 --> 05:35:03.120 align:start position:0%
aren't I'm on page 42 thanks um so we
 
05:35:05.350 --> 05:35:05.360 align:start position:0%
seem to be so I okay so to summarize
 
05:35:08.590 --> 05:35:08.600 align:start position:0%
page 42 it's just the first half uh we
 
05:35:11.548 --> 05:35:11.558 align:start position:0%
we did not make yeah I guess the only
 
05:35:12.830 --> 05:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
change we made there is we're going to
 
05:35:14.788 --> 05:35:14.798 align:start position:0%
recommend that there be two to four
 
05:35:16.470 --> 05:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
licensed charitable organizations for
 
05:35:23.070 --> 05:35:23.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:23.080 --> 05:35:31.750 align:start position:0%
 
72

05:35:31.750 --> 05:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:35.910 --> 05:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
um the effect of those cuts is to leave
 
05:35:38.430 --> 05:35:38.440 align:start position:0%
more money in the general fund to be
 
05:35:41.830 --> 05:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
used for other things
 
05:35:44.230 --> 05:35:44.240 align:start position:0%
hopefully some of them things that
 
05:35:46.670 --> 05:35:46.680 align:start position:0%
otherwise would have had to be cut
 
05:35:50.590 --> 05:35:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:53.990 --> 05:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
sand so yeah I I think that's obviously
 
05:35:55.628 --> 05:35:55.638 align:start position:0%
probably on page 72 that's the most
 
05:35:58.948 --> 05:35:58.958 align:start position:0%
significant line 26 and line 30 are the
 
05:36:01.270 --> 05:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
two significant lines that we need to
 
05:36:04.868 --> 05:36:04.878 align:start position:0%
look at both of those are cutting both
 
05:36:08.830 --> 05:36:08.840 align:start position:0%
of them cutting the amount to the
 
05:36:13.070 --> 05:36:13.080 align:start position:0%
education trust funds yes yeah
 
05:36:16.390 --> 05:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
yeah um by
 
05:36:16.400 --> 05:36:20.070 align:start position:0%
yeah um by
7%

05:36:20.070 --> 05:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:23.830 --> 05:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
right so yeah I don't know what the what
 
05:36:27.750 --> 05:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
is the the main point to that is to put
 
05:36:29.628 --> 05:36:29.638 align:start position:0%
more in the general fund I
 
05:36:33.510 --> 05:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
guess yeah it's it's in what is it the
 
05:36:35.708 --> 05:36:35.718 align:start position:0%
charts from
 
05:36:38.510 --> 05:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
Dr uh
 
05:36:38.520 --> 05:36:40.708 align:start position:0%
Dr uh
$95

05:36:40.708 --> 05:36:40.718 align:start position:0%
$95
 
05:36:43.868 --> 05:36:43.878 align:start position:0%
million coming to the general fund that
 
05:36:46.590 --> 05:36:46.600 align:start position:0%
was in the education trust fund if we
 
05:36:49.670 --> 05:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
were in uh what we thought we were going
 
05:36:54.910 --> 05:36:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:57.750 --> 05:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
23 so is my understanding that the
 
05:37:00.830 --> 05:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
education trust fund right now is is up
 
05:37:03.868 --> 05:37:03.878 align:start position:0%
by 95 million or
 
05:37:08.310 --> 05:37:08.320 align:start position:0%
something I don't think so do you
 
05:37:10.910 --> 05:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
question remember that um they have to
 
05:37:13.750 --> 05:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
take out money for sped from
 
05:37:16.628 --> 05:37:16.638 align:start position:0%
that how much I thought it was 50
 
05:37:18.070 --> 05:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
million but I'm not
 
05:37:21.910 --> 05:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
sure yeah that's for 2025 so I don't
 
05:37:23.190 --> 05:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
know if people have put that in the
 
05:37:25.030 --> 05:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
calculations yet at first the
 
05:37:26.990 --> 05:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner of Education wasn't going
 
05:37:29.548 --> 05:37:29.558 align:start position:0%
to ask for it and now he has asked for
 
05:37:31.990 --> 05:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
it to be taken out all right I guess can
 
05:37:34.430 --> 05:37:34.440 align:start position:0%
we have Dr come up for a
 
05:37:38.310 --> 05:37:38.320 align:start position:0%
minute hour
 
05:37:44.190 --> 05:37:44.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:44.200 --> 05:37:46.430 align:start position:0%
 
4:30

05:37:46.430 --> 05:37:46.440 align:start position:0%
4:30
 
05:37:55.390 --> 05:37:55.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:58.750 --> 05:37:58.760 align:start position:0%
today I got my uh I got my response from
 
05:38:01.590 --> 05:38:01.600 align:start position:0%
Finance as to when they want our
 
05:38:06.030 --> 05:38:06.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:12.750 --> 05:38:12.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:15.548 --> 05:38:15.558 align:start position:0%
care so I guess the first question for
 
05:38:17.230 --> 05:38:17.240 align:start position:0%
you is
 
05:38:19.430 --> 05:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
what is there a is there a positive
 
05:38:20.910 --> 05:38:20.920 align:start position:0%
balance right now in the education trust
 
05:38:23.030 --> 05:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
fund I believe the answer to that is yes
 
05:38:25.788 --> 05:38:25.798 align:start position:0%
I don't have the number because the uh
 
05:38:27.470 --> 05:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
the Acer hasn't been released yet for
 
05:38:29.990 --> 05:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
the current year we looked back when we
 
05:38:33.468 --> 05:38:33.478 align:start position:0%
were waiting uh to see what the balances
 
05:38:35.150 --> 05:38:35.160 align:start position:0%
had been in years past at the ending
 
05:38:37.430 --> 05:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
balance of the fund for 2023 it was a
 
05:38:41.868 --> 05:38:41.878 align:start position:0%
$161 million uh for 2022 it was $108
 
05:38:46.150 --> 05:38:46.160 align:start position:0%
million um so I don't think it has going
 
05:38:47.670 --> 05:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
to have
 
05:38:50.070 --> 05:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
significantly um decreased so much that
 
05:38:52.150 --> 05:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
there's no balance there this year from
 
05:38:53.468 --> 05:38:53.478 align:start position:0%
what I've heard through the GD fund it's
 
05:38:55.310 --> 05:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
around h100 million I don't know how
 
05:38:57.070 --> 05:38:57.080 align:start position:0%
accurate that is but representative
 
05:38:57.080 --> 05:38:58.670 align:start position:0%
accurate that is but representative
southworth's

05:38:58.670 --> 05:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
southworth's
 
05:39:01.708 --> 05:39:01.718 align:start position:0%
point I heard 100 million before they
 
05:39:04.030 --> 05:39:04.040 align:start position:0%
deal with the special education
 
05:39:07.070 --> 05:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
issue has that come to you guys at all
 
05:39:10.350 --> 05:39:10.360 align:start position:0%
not to me yeah the commissioner may know
 
05:39:14.948 --> 05:39:14.958 align:start position:0%
but I don't thank you yeah represent UL
 
05:39:17.670 --> 05:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
real quickly um you're talking about the
 
05:39:19.670 --> 05:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
variance number over here that's just
 
05:39:24.708 --> 05:39:24.718 align:start position:0%
the differences in each account so if
 
05:39:26.910 --> 05:39:26.920 align:start position:0%
this if the other
 
05:39:31.030 --> 05:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
two uh proposed law takes place you're
 
05:39:34.590 --> 05:39:34.600 align:start position:0%
taking 94 from one and adding 94 to the
 
05:39:37.788 --> 05:39:37.798 align:start position:0%
other uh that that's all that is it's
 
05:39:40.230 --> 05:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
not saying there's a deficit in the
 
05:39:43.548 --> 05:39:43.558 align:start position:0%
education trust fund of 94,000 that's
 
05:39:47.030 --> 05:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
correct that it's only the difference on
 
05:39:50.868 --> 05:39:50.878 align:start position:0%
of the two laws yes our analysis assumed
 
05:39:53.030 --> 05:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
that going forward the numbers the
 
05:39:54.910 --> 05:39:54.920 align:start position:0%
revenue numbers would be the same as we
 
05:40:02.990 --> 05:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
used 2025 plan and using 2025 plan um
 
05:40:07.190 --> 05:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
$95 million would shift from the ETF to
 
05:40:09.310 --> 05:40:09.320 align:start position:0%
the the general fund if everything
 
05:40:11.270 --> 05:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
remains static and people don't do what
 
05:40:15.708 --> 05:40:15.718 align:start position:0%
people do correct thank
 
05:40:18.868 --> 05:40:18.878 align:start position:0%
you excuse me can I just ask a question
 
05:40:23.270 --> 05:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
yes how far off the 25 plan are we
 
05:40:25.750 --> 05:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
currently about
 
05:40:30.868 --> 05:40:30.878 align:start position:0%
18% um we also not in our fiscal uh note
 
05:40:33.628 --> 05:40:33.638 align:start position:0%
for you but um separate and apart from
 
05:40:37.430 --> 05:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
it we ran yesterday uh numbers based on
 
05:40:40.070 --> 05:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
the revenue estimating numbers that you
 
05:40:42.990 --> 05:40:43.000 align:start position:0%
all adopted a few weeks ago if you use
 
05:40:43.000 --> 05:40:43.868 align:start position:0%
all adopted a few weeks ago if you use
what

05:40:43.868 --> 05:40:43.878 align:start position:0%
what
 
05:40:49.948 --> 05:40:49.958 align:start position:0%
you assumed for fiscal 25 26 and 27 um
 
05:40:52.270 --> 05:40:52.280 align:start position:0%
it looks more like
 
05:40:57.670 --> 05:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
75 to 80 million depending upon the year
 
05:41:01.830 --> 05:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
okay 75 to 80 for
 
05:41:05.390 --> 05:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
what this is where's the year there we
 
05:41:09.270 --> 05:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
go uh yeah so the fiscal year 25 it's $
 
05:41:12.990 --> 05:41:13.000 align:start position:0%
75.4 million shift using your Revenue
 
05:41:15.708 --> 05:41:15.718 align:start position:0%
estimating numbers for fiscal year 26 it
 
05:41:18.948 --> 05:41:18.958 align:start position:0%
would be a $ 77.2 million shift and
 
05:41:20.590 --> 05:41:20.600 align:start position:0%
using your Revenue estimating numbers
 
05:41:23.030 --> 05:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year 27 it would be an even
 
05:41:26.310 --> 05:41:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:29.948 --> 05:41:29.958 align:start position:0%
shift Mr chair may I ask a question and
 
05:41:33.230 --> 05:41:33.240 align:start position:0%
if we had used the only dissenting vote
 
05:41:35.150 --> 05:41:35.160 align:start position:0%
that said it was going to be 200 million
 
05:41:38.750 --> 05:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:42.070 --> 05:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
out of that total what would be the what
 
05:41:45.190 --> 05:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
would be the numbers can you in the next
 
05:41:48.030 --> 05:41:48.040 align:start position:0%
10 minutes as we work on that
 
05:41:52.070 --> 05:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
why sorry which year are we discussing
 
05:41:57.390 --> 05:41:57.400 align:start position:0%
uh what year we in 25 20 yeah 25 26 just
 
05:42:00.070 --> 05:42:00.080 align:start position:0%
the numbers you did just for this past
 
05:42:02.070 --> 05:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
group y because I had to express that I
 
05:42:04.750 --> 05:42:04.760 align:start position:0%
thought we were too high on the BPT tax
 
05:42:06.548 --> 05:42:06.558 align:start position:0%
of over 200 million we should be in the
 
05:42:09.548 --> 05:42:09.558 align:start position:0%
900 million doll range and this is a 1.1
 
05:42:11.590 --> 05:42:11.600 align:start position:0%
billion that they're looking at so I
 
05:42:13.750 --> 05:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
just wonder what the difference would be
 
05:42:16.390 --> 05:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
yep so um thank you I think the revenue
 
05:42:19.350 --> 05:42:19.360 align:start position:0%
number that you used was a million or a
 
05:42:19.360 --> 05:42:20.910 align:start position:0%
number that you used was a million or a
billion

05:42:20.910 --> 05:42:20.920 align:start position:0%
billion
 
05:42:24.628 --> 05:42:24.638 align:start position:0%
30 uh and if you used
 
05:42:26.788 --> 05:42:26.798 align:start position:0%
900,000 instead for both of the business
 
05:42:29.708 --> 05:42:29.718 align:start position:0%
ta 900,000 yeah so just for the business
 
05:42:32.948 --> 05:42:32.958 align:start position:0%
tax sorry for just the business taxes if
 
05:42:35.390 --> 05:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
let's just assume 900 million the
 
05:42:37.270 --> 05:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
difference between current law and
 
05:42:42.110 --> 05:42:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:44.350 --> 05:42:44.360 align:start position:0%
million is that not making sense to you
 
05:42:46.868 --> 05:42:46.878 align:start position:0%
representative shamberg so that the less
 
05:42:53.270 --> 05:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:57.030 --> 05:42:57.040 align:start position:0%
shift I also understand Mr chairman that
 
05:42:58.430 --> 05:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
these numbers here
 
05:43:02.390 --> 05:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
will not provide the to be less property
 
05:43:03.990 --> 05:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
tax relief because adequate funding will
 
05:43:04.000 --> 05:43:04.830 align:start position:0%
tax relief because adequate funding will
go

05:43:04.830 --> 05:43:04.840 align:start position:0%
go
 
05:43:08.030 --> 05:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
down and um
 
05:43:10.390 --> 05:43:10.400 align:start position:0%
that's my position on this
 
05:43:13.830 --> 05:43:13.840 align:start position:0%
I feel we're we're moving it's amazing
 
05:43:16.868 --> 05:43:16.878 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman that when I had proposed
 
05:43:18.948 --> 05:43:18.958 align:start position:0%
this in my other bills they were going
 
05:43:20.750 --> 05:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
the other direction but I see someone's
 
05:43:24.468 --> 05:43:24.478 align:start position:0%
taking up that hint of
 
05:43:28.830 --> 05:43:28.840 align:start position:0%
cutting we are cutting well okay so to
 
05:43:31.910 --> 05:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
to the getting back to line 26 and line
 
05:43:35.430 --> 05:43:35.440 align:start position:0%
30 um do we have a different suggestion
 
05:43:36.830 --> 05:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
than what the governor is suggesting
 
05:43:36.840 --> 05:43:38.750 align:start position:0%
than what the governor is suggesting
there

05:43:38.750 --> 05:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:43:41.150 --> 05:43:41.160 align:start position:0%
I suggest don't do anything because I
 
05:43:43.270 --> 05:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
think the corner office is saying we're
 
05:43:45.590 --> 05:43:45.600 align:start position:0%
going to move this money and property
 
05:43:46.990 --> 05:43:47.000 align:start position:0%
tax owners are going to have to make up
 
05:43:56.070 --> 05:43:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:58.670 --> 05:43:58.680 align:start position:0%
communities just my
 
05:44:02.750 --> 05:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
opinion yes represent El me thank you
 
05:44:05.708 --> 05:44:05.718 align:start position:0%
and I look at this from a different
 
05:44:09.350 --> 05:44:09.360 align:start position:0%
perspective which is that she's moving
 
05:44:12.548 --> 05:44:12.558 align:start position:0%
this money to fund things that she
 
05:44:15.190 --> 05:44:15.200 align:start position:0%
thinks ought to stay alive that aren't
 
05:44:19.468 --> 05:44:19.478 align:start position:0%
going to stay alive um that she cares
 
05:44:21.590 --> 05:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
about and I have no idea which ones
 
05:44:25.270 --> 05:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
those are but I think that the finance
 
05:44:28.190 --> 05:44:28.200 align:start position:0%
committee needs to make this
 
05:44:31.230 --> 05:44:31.240 align:start position:0%
decision rather than us so so your
 
05:44:33.868 --> 05:44:33.878 align:start position:0%
thought is just let them let them figure
 
05:44:36.430 --> 05:44:36.440 align:start position:0%
that out on point of order yeah just
 
05:44:38.350 --> 05:44:38.360 align:start position:0%
following up on on her comment really
 
05:44:40.030 --> 05:44:40.040 align:start position:0%
isn't it their decision no matter what
 
05:44:43.230 --> 05:44:43.240 align:start position:0%
we say yes yeah oh yeah no we're just so
 
05:44:45.590 --> 05:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
I guess we're just saying we won't make
 
05:44:48.548 --> 05:44:48.558 align:start position:0%
any recommendation on that Mr chairman
 
05:44:50.030 --> 05:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
to that point then why are we here why
 
05:44:51.390 --> 05:44:51.400 align:start position:0%
did we just spend the last two hours
 
05:44:52.868 --> 05:44:52.878 align:start position:0%
doing this well we do have a set of
 
05:44:55.110 --> 05:44:55.120 align:start position:0%
recommendations for them uh they don't
 
05:44:56.390 --> 05:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
have to take we have a set of
 
05:44:58.948 --> 05:44:58.958 align:start position:0%
recommendations on everything except
 
05:45:01.548 --> 05:45:01.558 align:start position:0%
money excuse me Mr chairman it's just
 
05:45:03.310 --> 05:45:03.320 align:start position:0%
it's just a little frustrating to go
 
05:45:05.070 --> 05:45:05.080 align:start position:0%
through this process and essentially
 
05:45:07.788 --> 05:45:07.798 align:start position:0%
arrive at a point where the most
 
05:45:13.590 --> 05:45:13.600 align:start position:0%
important issue before us is money and
 
05:45:15.628 --> 05:45:15.638 align:start position:0%
revenue and we
 
05:45:19.670 --> 05:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
are abandoning our position on
 
05:45:22.990 --> 05:45:23.000 align:start position:0%
recommendations on money and revenue as
 
05:45:25.270 --> 05:45:25.280 align:start position:0%
far as I can tell maybe maybe I'm
 
05:45:28.310 --> 05:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
missing something but um I just feel
 
05:45:30.000 --> 05:45:30.010 align:start position:0%
like we've wasted the last two
 
05:45:30.010 --> 05:45:32.230 align:start position:0%
like we've wasted the last two
[Music]

05:45:32.230 --> 05:45:32.240 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:45:36.390 --> 05:45:36.400 align:start position:0%
hours I don't I don't think so because
 
05:45:38.468 --> 05:45:38.478 align:start position:0%
uh you know I'm just going back to look
 
05:45:42.910 --> 05:45:42.920 align:start position:0%
at what we did um
 
05:45:45.628 --> 05:45:45.638 align:start position:0%
but what the things that we are talking
 
05:45:47.910 --> 05:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
about Still Still affect money I mean if
 
05:45:49.548 --> 05:45:49.558 align:start position:0%
you're talking about did we raise money
 
05:45:51.590 --> 05:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
I mean may maybe we did maybe we didn't
 
05:45:54.468 --> 05:45:54.478 align:start position:0%
but um you know the the fact that we're
 
05:45:57.430 --> 05:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
allowing towns to opt in and opt out
 
05:46:00.030 --> 05:46:00.040 align:start position:0%
that's potentially you know a money
 
05:46:01.150 --> 05:46:01.160 align:start position:0%
decision for
 
05:46:05.270 --> 05:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
towns um contributing to group one uh
 
05:46:07.830 --> 05:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
teachers I think that's that's a money
 
05:46:11.670 --> 05:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
issue we're looking to uh get more money
 
05:46:11.680 --> 05:46:14.910 align:start position:0%
issue we're looking to uh get more money
into

05:46:14.910 --> 05:46:14.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:18.350 --> 05:46:18.360 align:start position:0%
them well we're we're correct me if I'm
 
05:46:19.830 --> 05:46:19.840 align:start position:0%
wrong but we're recommending all of
 
05:46:21.788 --> 05:46:21.798 align:start position:0%
those things correct we we don't have
 
05:46:25.590 --> 05:46:25.600 align:start position:0%
any power to actually do that we're I
 
05:46:27.468 --> 05:46:27.478 align:start position:0%
understand and so we're recommending
 
05:46:30.510 --> 05:46:30.520 align:start position:0%
these things but we're choosing not to
 
05:46:35.628 --> 05:46:35.638 align:start position:0%
recommend anything on what I think
 
05:46:38.948 --> 05:46:38.958 align:start position:0%
are the major issues facing this
 
05:46:42.910 --> 05:46:42.920 align:start position:0%
committee this state our children we're
 
05:46:45.750 --> 05:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
just saying ah we'll we'll let somebody
 
05:46:49.110 --> 05:46:49.120 align:start position:0%
else handle that I I just think that's
 
05:46:51.350 --> 05:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
wrong well we we can make
 
05:46:53.548 --> 05:46:53.558 align:start position:0%
recommendations what is your
 
05:46:55.830 --> 05:46:55.840 align:start position:0%
suggestion have you read the entire
 
05:46:59.030 --> 05:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
budget and do you know what other places
 
05:47:02.150 --> 05:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
in the budget are being are losing money
 
05:47:04.150 --> 05:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
or gaining money
 
05:47:07.468 --> 05:47:07.478 align:start position:0%
because uh of her decisions
 
05:47:10.910 --> 05:47:10.920 align:start position:0%
because that's where we are this the the
 
05:47:13.708 --> 05:47:13.718 align:start position:0%
budget committee has to know these
 
05:47:15.788 --> 05:47:15.798 align:start position:0%
things that's why they divided in three
 
05:47:18.788 --> 05:47:18.798 align:start position:0%
parts so that they can look at them in
 
05:47:21.990 --> 05:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
detail on we don't know when we say we
 
05:47:24.230 --> 05:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
want to put more money into the ETF or
 
05:47:26.750 --> 05:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
we want to put it into the
 
05:47:29.750 --> 05:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
GF what that money is allocated to at
 
05:47:33.510 --> 05:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
the moment and what we lose if we take
 
05:47:37.270 --> 05:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
it from there to put it somewhere else
 
05:47:40.590 --> 05:47:40.600 align:start position:0%
well well I I I don't disagree um
 
05:47:43.150 --> 05:47:43.160 align:start position:0%
representative but I I think essentially
 
05:47:45.350 --> 05:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
what we're doing here is saying you know
 
05:47:48.788 --> 05:47:48.798 align:start position:0%
we've got five miles to feed and you
 
05:47:50.230 --> 05:47:50.240 align:start position:0%
know the fifth one we're just not going
 
05:47:53.110 --> 05:47:53.120 align:start position:0%
to feed we're making
 
05:47:56.590 --> 05:47:56.600 align:start position:0%
decisions at the end of the day and I
 
05:47:58.670 --> 05:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
we've raised this again and again and I
 
05:48:00.910 --> 05:48:00.920 align:start position:0%
I recognize the other side does not
 
05:48:04.190 --> 05:48:04.200 align:start position:0%
agree but we we are we are we've raised
 
05:48:07.830 --> 05:48:07.840 align:start position:0%
the issue it is about Revenue
 
05:48:09.548 --> 05:48:09.558 align:start position:0%
and and we
 
05:48:13.830 --> 05:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
have or this body has chosen
 
05:48:17.468 --> 05:48:17.478 align:start position:0%
to in my opinion make decisions that are
 
05:48:19.990 --> 05:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
exacerbating the problem and now when we
 
05:48:23.788 --> 05:48:23.798 align:start position:0%
come to face that fifth
 
05:48:27.150 --> 05:48:27.160 align:start position:0%
child who's going hungry we're saying
 
05:48:28.990 --> 05:48:29.000 align:start position:0%
well let's let Finance handle
 
05:48:32.030 --> 05:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
it no I haven't read the entire budget I
 
05:48:33.468 --> 05:48:33.478 align:start position:0%
I very honestly I haven't read the
 
05:48:36.990 --> 05:48:37.000 align:start position:0%
entire budget I do know that
 
05:48:38.230 --> 05:48:38.240 align:start position:0%
my priorities and the governor's
 
05:48:40.670 --> 05:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
priorities would be very
 
05:48:43.430 --> 05:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
different I think to represent El's
 
05:48:45.868 --> 05:48:45.878 align:start position:0%
point we we have to be careful not to
 
05:48:48.270 --> 05:48:48.280 align:start position:0%
make a change because yeah my my first
 
05:48:50.830 --> 05:48:50.840 align:start position:0%
reaction is just leave it at 41 why are
 
05:48:52.868 --> 05:48:52.878 align:start position:0%
we cutting it but I don't have a global
 
05:48:54.510 --> 05:48:54.520 align:start position:0%
view I have not read the whole budget I
 
05:48:56.548 --> 05:48:56.558 align:start position:0%
don't have a global view of the whole
 
05:49:00.310 --> 05:49:00.320 align:start position:0%
thing so by changing this what are we
 
05:49:02.270 --> 05:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
then affecting I I I understand your
 
05:49:04.948 --> 05:49:04.958 align:start position:0%
point I don't disagree with the basics
 
05:49:07.910 --> 05:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
of your point I just yeah
 
05:49:12.070 --> 05:49:12.080 align:start position:0%
represent Elber thank you um are are you
 
05:49:14.990 --> 05:49:15.000 align:start position:0%
in effect saying that what we're looking
 
05:49:18.030 --> 05:49:18.040 align:start position:0%
at is a zero sum game and we should be
 
05:49:18.040 --> 05:49:18.948 align:start position:0%
at is a zero sum game and we should be
looking

05:49:18.948 --> 05:49:18.958 align:start position:0%
looking
 
05:49:22.990 --> 05:49:23.000 align:start position:0%
at adding rather than having a zero sum
 
05:49:25.230 --> 05:49:25.240 align:start position:0%
I think it's worse than a zero sum
 
05:49:27.390 --> 05:49:27.400 align:start position:0%
game and I would agree with you I mean
 
05:49:29.230 --> 05:49:29.240 align:start position:0%
in in some CA at least in a zero sum
 
05:49:30.990 --> 05:49:31.000 align:start position:0%
game you walk away with nothing you know
 
05:49:33.390 --> 05:49:33.400 align:start position:0%
one party walks away with nothing I
 
05:49:35.030 --> 05:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
think we're telling one party they're
 
05:49:36.150 --> 05:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
going to walk away with less than
 
05:49:36.160 --> 05:49:40.230 align:start position:0%
going to walk away with less than
nothing

05:49:40.230 --> 05:49:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:42.350 --> 05:49:42.360 align:start position:0%
well I think on the V I think on the VT
 
05:49:44.670 --> 05:49:44.680 align:start position:0%
side of things um you know that is that
 
05:49:47.590 --> 05:49:47.600 align:start position:0%
is one area where we're talking about uh
 
05:49:50.030 --> 05:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
new Revenue so
 
05:49:53.468 --> 05:49:53.478 align:start position:0%
um is it a challenging time right now
 
05:49:57.670 --> 05:49:57.680 align:start position:0%
yes um and uh you know we've got to kind
 
05:50:00.548 --> 05:50:00.558 align:start position:0%
of walk that walk represent South wor
 
05:50:02.628 --> 05:50:02.638 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm going to choose my words
 
05:50:05.948 --> 05:50:05.958 align:start position:0%
carefully um I guess I'd say regrettably
 
05:50:08.628 --> 05:50:08.638 align:start position:0%
we are a part AR committee and I don't
 
05:50:10.910 --> 05:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
think we can make big recommendations
 
05:50:13.830 --> 05:50:13.840 align:start position:0%
when we're missing one two three six
 
05:50:17.070 --> 05:50:17.080 align:start position:0%
people from one of the parties I just
 
05:50:19.310 --> 05:50:19.320 align:start position:0%
you know I'm frustrated like many other
 
05:50:21.590 --> 05:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
people I'd like more Revenue more for
 
05:50:25.548 --> 05:50:25.558 align:start position:0%
schools and so on but today our task on
 
05:50:28.670 --> 05:50:28.680 align:start position:0%
this um you know this is where we are
 
05:50:31.190 --> 05:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
and um for the minority to make some
 
05:50:33.548 --> 05:50:33.558 align:start position:0%
strong recommendations in this it's not
 
05:50:35.350 --> 05:50:35.360 align:start position:0%
really giving them the the picture of
 
05:50:38.350 --> 05:50:38.360 align:start position:0%
the committee with five and actually it
 
05:50:42.868 --> 05:50:42.878 align:start position:0%
didn't even count um oh so um the people
 
05:50:45.590 --> 05:50:45.600 align:start position:0%
that are here have a very different
 
05:50:48.270 --> 05:50:48.280 align:start position:0%
philosophy uh on my side than the people
 
05:50:51.110 --> 05:50:51.120 align:start position:0%
who are not here who are in the majority
 
05:50:52.910 --> 05:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
and again to me that's regrettable I
 
05:50:57.110 --> 05:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
wish it wasn't true but it is true 95%
 
05:51:00.910 --> 05:51:00.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:06.708 --> 05:51:06.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:11.230 --> 05:51:11.240 align:start position:0%
okay um represent El me yeah I don't
 
05:51:16.110 --> 05:51:16.120 align:start position:0%
want us to walk away before looking at
 
05:51:18.590 --> 05:51:18.600 align:start position:0%
page 72 line
 
05:51:26.510 --> 05:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
23 and at on P line 35
 
05:51:30.270 --> 05:51:30.280 align:start position:0%
23 Charlie's still
 
05:51:36.788 --> 05:51:36.798 align:start position:0%
here uh we raised at your request 15
 
05:51:38.510 --> 05:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
years ago or
 
05:51:42.468 --> 05:51:42.478 align:start position:0%
something uh up to the the tickets up to
 
05:51:45.350 --> 05:51:45.360 align:start position:0%
$30 it was a disaster nobody wanted to
 
05:51:48.510 --> 05:51:48.520 align:start position:0%
buy them oh
 
05:51:52.110 --> 05:51:52.120 align:start position:0%
50 no and and what now you're trying to
 
05:51:53.910 --> 05:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
raise it to or someone is trying to
 
05:51:55.150 --> 05:51:55.160 align:start position:0%
raise it to his
 
05:51:57.350 --> 05:51:57.360 align:start position:0%
$50 per ticket the question
 
05:51:59.830 --> 05:51:59.840 align:start position:0%
representative it was not me it was my
 
05:52:03.708 --> 05:52:03.718 align:start position:0%
predecessor was predecessor it was 2006
 
05:52:07.070 --> 05:52:07.080 align:start position:0%
oh um that Rick Whistler uh came and
 
05:52:10.430 --> 05:52:10.440 align:start position:0%
asked R $30 ticket um it wasn't the
 
05:52:13.150 --> 05:52:13.160 align:start position:0%
price point so much as it was the awful
 
05:52:15.468 --> 05:52:15.478 align:start position:0%
execution and the launching of it during
 
05:52:21.350 --> 05:52:21.360 align:start position:0%
the 2007 2008 uh Great Recession uh and
 
05:52:23.468 --> 05:52:23.478 align:start position:0%
when gas prices spiked and it was all
 
05:52:25.830 --> 05:52:25.840 align:start position:0%
bad uh and so it hasn't been raised in
 
05:52:27.948 --> 05:52:27.958 align:start position:0%
17 years and so it's our request to do
 
05:52:30.628 --> 05:52:30.638 align:start position:0%
it I don't expect I do it the next year
 
05:52:32.230 --> 05:52:32.240 align:start position:0%
honestly it would probably be the year
 
05:52:34.708 --> 05:52:34.718 align:start position:0%
two of the bium just because you plan it
 
05:52:36.910 --> 05:52:36.920 align:start position:0%
out and do it accordingly but I think
 
05:52:38.430 --> 05:52:38.440 align:start position:0%
we're one of the few states that doesn't
 
05:52:40.270 --> 05:52:40.280 align:start position:0%
have one and so they're just asking for
 
05:52:44.750 --> 05:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
the authority that's all great
 
05:52:47.548 --> 05:52:47.558 align:start position:0%
thanks anything else any other parts of
 
05:52:47.558 --> 05:52:48.510 align:start position:0%
thanks anything else any other parts of
the

05:52:48.510 --> 05:52:48.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:52:50.830 --> 05:52:50.840 align:start position:0%
tobacco uh
 
05:52:53.548 --> 05:52:53.558 align:start position:0%
Revenue um this
 
05:52:57.310 --> 05:52:57.320 align:start position:0%
is something our committee
 
05:53:00.830 --> 05:53:00.840 align:start position:0%
does on which they're
 
05:53:05.468 --> 05:53:05.478 align:start position:0%
changing the division of the tax revenue
 
05:53:09.310 --> 05:53:09.320 align:start position:0%
by the long term formula that we've had
 
05:53:13.430 --> 05:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh to just being 34% like everybody
 
05:53:17.548 --> 05:53:17.558 align:start position:0%
else and it's a very minimalist change
 
05:53:23.230 --> 05:53:23.240 align:start position:0%
um it's um 7824 distribution of funds
 
05:53:23.240 --> 05:53:24.628 align:start position:0%
um it's um 7824 distribution of funds
line

05:53:24.628 --> 05:53:24.638 align:start position:0%
line
 
05:53:28.350 --> 05:53:28.360 align:start position:0%
35 Roman one tax revenue on all tobacco
 
05:53:31.230 --> 05:53:31.240 align:start position:0%
products sold at retail in the state
 
05:53:34.670 --> 05:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
imposed by RSA 782 shall be divided with
 
05:53:37.190 --> 05:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
34% of the total revenue Vue being
 
05:53:39.150 --> 05:53:39.160 align:start position:0%
deposited in the education trust fund
 
05:53:41.430 --> 05:53:41.440 align:start position:0%
and the remaining in the general fund
 
05:53:43.750 --> 05:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
it's only a
 
05:53:49.230 --> 05:53:49.240 align:start position:0%
difference of oh no it's uh it goes
 
05:53:53.670 --> 05:53:53.680 align:start position:0%
from um the ETF getting
 
05:53:58.270 --> 05:53:58.280 align:start position:0%
43. 82% so it isn't minimalist uh
 
05:54:00.830 --> 05:54:00.840 align:start position:0%
percent of the tobacco Revenue down to
 
05:54:03.510 --> 05:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
34 so that it will be the same of it as
 
05:54:07.628 --> 05:54:07.638 align:start position:0%
everybody else um I don't know if we
 
05:54:10.430 --> 05:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
want to comment on that cuz this weird
 
05:54:13.868 --> 05:54:13.878 align:start position:0%
formula is the one that the the uh Ways
 
05:54:19.350 --> 05:54:19.360 align:start position:0%
and Means Committee uh resulted in after
 
05:54:22.628 --> 05:54:22.638 align:start position:0%
we decided that we had to set the other
 
05:54:27.390 --> 05:54:27.400 align:start position:0%
tobacco products to the same sales level
 
05:54:34.150 --> 05:54:34.160 align:start position:0%
as as the um percentage level as as the
 
05:54:40.030 --> 05:54:40.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:43.070 --> 05:54:43.080 align:start position:0%
says tobacco products which
 
05:54:46.310 --> 05:54:46.320 align:start position:0%
includes the um non-cigarette
 
05:54:50.390 --> 05:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
stuff down cigarette stuff non-cigarette
 
05:54:56.350 --> 05:54:56.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:58.708 --> 05:54:58.718 align:start position:0%
vaping at least I don't think it
 
05:55:01.030 --> 05:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
includes vaping could piss off a
 
05:55:03.990 --> 05:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
majority leer include bapy now yeah that
 
05:55:08.510 --> 05:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:10.910 --> 05:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
but um unfortunately it would be very
 
05:55:13.150 --> 05:55:13.160 align:start position:0%
hard to join a
 
05:55:13.160 --> 05:55:14.830 align:start position:0%
hard to join a
fo

05:55:14.830 --> 05:55:14.840 align:start position:0%
fo
 
05:55:17.230 --> 05:55:17.240 align:start position:0%
so I don't know what was it before and
 
05:55:36.948 --> 05:55:36.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:39.750 --> 05:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
we two or three times after that
 
05:55:43.510 --> 05:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
increased the cigarette tax and that
 
05:55:46.510 --> 05:55:46.520 align:start position:0%
meant we had to do it by an equivalent
 
05:55:49.910 --> 05:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
amount which ended up being this
 
05:55:52.150 --> 05:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
42.8% when we
 
05:55:56.310 --> 05:55:56.320 align:start position:0%
finished and decided not to do it
 
05:55:58.910 --> 05:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
again okay
 
05:56:03.190 --> 05:56:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:08.150 --> 05:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
does also take take from the
 
05:56:08.160 --> 05:56:10.990 align:start position:0%
does also take take from the
ETF

05:56:10.990 --> 05:56:11.000 align:start position:0%
ETF
 
05:56:14.868 --> 05:56:14.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:36.510 --> 05:56:36.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:38.548 --> 05:56:38.558 align:start position:0%
so um what do you want to do with that
 
05:56:41.430 --> 05:56:41.440 align:start position:0%
line well that's the question we don't
 
05:56:44.708 --> 05:56:44.718 align:start position:0%
have enough here I guess to decide it
 
05:56:47.548 --> 05:56:47.558 align:start position:0%
but well if we all agree we have enough
 
05:56:51.628 --> 05:56:51.638 align:start position:0%
here do we want to go with her let's
 
05:56:53.628 --> 05:56:53.638 align:start position:0%
just do one uniform price acrost
 
05:56:56.910 --> 05:56:56.920 align:start position:0%
everything that isn't equivalent
 
05:56:59.070 --> 05:56:59.080 align:start position:0%
um that's what it kind of looks like I
 
05:57:00.468 --> 05:57:00.478 align:start position:0%
don't know if that's the case that's
 
05:57:04.350 --> 05:57:04.360 align:start position:0%
what she did 34% for
 
05:57:07.230 --> 05:57:07.240 align:start position:0%
everything and
 
05:57:08.948 --> 05:57:08.958 align:start position:0%
it won't work for
 
05:57:17.788 --> 05:57:17.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:20.468 --> 05:57:20.478 align:start position:0%
it I mean it's kind of the same it's
 
05:57:20.478 --> 05:57:21.510 align:start position:0%
it I mean it's kind of the same it's
kind

05:57:21.510 --> 05:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
kind
 
05:57:25.430 --> 05:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
of have a say in it yeah I mean we can
 
05:57:27.030 --> 05:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
make a recommendation it's kind of the
 
05:57:28.590 --> 05:57:28.600 align:start position:0%
same as what you just said earlier about
 
05:57:28.600 --> 05:57:29.750 align:start position:0%
same as what you just said earlier about
the

05:57:29.750 --> 05:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:57:33.670 --> 05:57:33.680 align:start position:0%
34% of the uh BPT and
 
05:57:36.708 --> 05:57:36.718 align:start position:0%
bet uh do we have enough contact
 
05:57:39.510 --> 05:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
to make a decision and we can recommend
 
05:57:41.628 --> 05:57:41.638 align:start position:0%
something as long as
 
05:57:44.910 --> 05:57:44.920 align:start position:0%
we it sounds to me like they didn't
 
05:57:47.430 --> 05:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
really know a whole lot about this they
 
05:57:50.230 --> 05:57:50.240 align:start position:0%
decided have a uniform tax rate wherever
 
05:57:50.240 --> 05:57:51.430 align:start position:0%
decided have a uniform tax rate wherever
they

05:57:51.430 --> 05:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
they
 
05:57:51.440 --> 05:57:57.510 align:start position:0%
they
could

05:57:57.510 --> 05:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:01.628 --> 05:58:01.638 align:start position:0%
possibly parents not well
 
05:58:31.390 --> 05:58:31.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:35.150 --> 05:58:35.160 align:start position:0%
I have a thought yeah um could we just
 
05:58:37.350 --> 05:58:37.360 align:start position:0%
have a sentence um similar to what
 
05:58:39.070 --> 05:58:39.080 align:start position:0%
representative elmy said just at the
 
05:58:41.390 --> 05:58:41.400 align:start position:0%
very end saying to consider the
 
05:58:43.310 --> 05:58:43.320 align:start position:0%
breakdown of the different tobacco
 
05:58:50.270 --> 05:58:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:53.670 --> 05:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
34% they're not even um because they're
 
05:58:54.868 --> 05:58:54.878 align:start position:0%
not breaking them down at all when you
 
05:58:56.830 --> 05:58:56.840 align:start position:0%
say tobacco product are you including
 
05:59:01.110 --> 05:59:01.120 align:start position:0%
vaping no no not tobacco no I'm asking
 
05:59:04.150 --> 05:59:04.160 align:start position:0%
represent self workor um I would um
 
05:59:06.548 --> 05:59:06.558 align:start position:0%
again say you could put as
 
05:59:09.430 --> 05:59:09.440 align:start position:0%
consider including vaping or considering
 
05:59:12.750 --> 05:59:12.760 align:start position:0%
a formula for Vaping something really
 
05:59:14.390 --> 05:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
represent Aly has better words for it
 
05:59:16.750 --> 05:59:16.760 align:start position:0%
than I do but I don't think there's any
 
05:59:19.390 --> 05:59:19.400 align:start position:0%
wrong with asking them to consider
 
05:59:22.868 --> 05:59:22.878 align:start position:0%
something well they take not much time
 
05:59:26.030 --> 05:59:26.040 align:start position:0%
to do a lot of work
 
05:59:32.948 --> 05:59:32.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:32.958 --> 05:59:35.030 align:start position:0%
 
recommendations

05:59:35.030 --> 05:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
05:59:39.150 --> 05:59:39.160 align:start position:0%
yes microphone microphone
 
05:59:41.750 --> 05:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
microphone as a nonsmoker I'm not sure
 
05:59:46.830 --> 05:59:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:53.868 --> 05:59:53.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:02.948 --> 06:00:02.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:08.310 --> 06:00:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:13.750 --> 06:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
says OTP EIG oh oh yes I don't know how
 
06:00:13.760 --> 06:00:50.788 align:start position:0%
says OTP EIG oh oh yes I don't know how
they

06:00:50.788 --> 06:00:50.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:52.788 --> 06:00:52.798 align:start position:0%
all right so is there any so what do we
 
06:00:57.190 --> 06:00:57.200 align:start position:0%
want to do with line 26 30 and
 
06:00:57.200 --> 06:00:59.548 align:start position:0%
want to do with line 26 30 and
um

06:00:59.548 --> 06:00:59.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:01:03.190 --> 06:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
36 I mean they're all

here so what do you want to ask a
 
06:01:19.270 --> 06:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:23.590 --> 06:01:23.600 align:start position:0%
question oh oh okay do you have a

please I do have a question on on the
 
06:01:40.310 --> 06:01:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:43.150 --> 06:01:43.160 align:start position:0%
I understand that there's a bill coming
 
06:01:47.070 --> 06:01:47.080 align:start position:0%
from Lang at some point to us uh that
 
06:01:49.708 --> 06:01:49.718 align:start position:0%
deals with trying to get a better idea
 
06:01:53.948 --> 06:01:53.958 align:start position:0%
of what all the Contraband is in in
 
06:01:57.788 --> 06:01:57.798 align:start position:0%
EIG but this would just refer to the
 
06:02:00.270 --> 06:02:00.280 align:start position:0%
part that you've been able to get tax
 
06:02:03.590 --> 06:02:03.600 align:start position:0%
returns from right so again just like we
 
06:02:05.990 --> 06:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
did with the business taxes we assumed
 
06:02:09.510 --> 06:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
that uh the all of the three revenue
 
06:02:12.590 --> 06:02:12.600 align:start position:0%
streams within the tobacco tax would uh
 
06:02:15.948 --> 06:02:15.958 align:start position:0%
perform according to 2025 plan and this
 
06:02:17.750 --> 06:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
analysis that we did represents the
 
06:02:20.628 --> 06:02:20.638 align:start position:0%
shift from the education trust fund to
 
06:02:23.628 --> 06:02:23.638 align:start position:0%
the general fund for that Revenue stream
 
06:02:25.990 --> 06:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
it does include the vaping products or
 
06:02:29.350 --> 06:02:29.360 align:start position:0%
the eigs those currently do not go to
 
06:02:32.788 --> 06:02:32.798 align:start position:0%
ETF at all yeah and this would shift 34%
 
06:02:35.548 --> 06:02:35.558 align:start position:0%
of that Revenue to the ETF this does not
 
06:02:39.390 --> 06:02:39.400 align:start position:0%
touch the rate um of the two types of
 
06:02:41.788 --> 06:02:41.798 align:start position:0%
vaping products which are different yeah
 
06:02:43.708 --> 06:02:43.718 align:start position:0%
it just looks at the amount of money
 
06:02:47.670 --> 06:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:51.030 --> 06:02:51.040 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah my thought Mr chairman you
 
06:02:55.670 --> 06:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
just asked about 26 30 and
 
06:02:58.190 --> 06:02:58.200 align:start position:0%
36 I think we should just recommend they
 
06:03:01.310 --> 06:03:01.320 align:start position:0%
stay at 41 41 and
 
06:03:04.830 --> 06:03:04.840 align:start position:0%
43.8 not their their suggestion what is
 
06:03:07.430 --> 06:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
that last one is it 4 2.8 represent elme
 
06:03:12.110 --> 06:03:12.120 align:start position:0%
the line 36 where where is line 36 page
 
06:03:17.190 --> 06:03:17.200 align:start position:0%
72 this thing line 36 oh what's in the
 
06:03:19.230 --> 06:03:19.240 align:start position:0%
going to the education trust fund right
 
06:03:21.350 --> 06:03:21.360 align:start position:0%
now yeah that's
 
06:03:26.430 --> 06:03:26.440 align:start position:0%
so is it 42.8 or what is it I thought
 
06:03:28.910 --> 06:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
that's what you suggested there
 
06:03:36.590 --> 06:03:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:45.190 --> 06:03:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:47.670 --> 06:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
now no but represent El me earlier you
 
06:03:51.110 --> 06:03:51.120 align:start position:0%
said 42.8 I thought maybe that was
 
06:04:05.990 --> 06:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:08.830 --> 06:04:08.840 align:start position:0%
mhm and I'm sorry the stamp sorry yes
 
06:04:11.670 --> 06:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
the stamp
 
06:04:11.680 --> 06:04:14.230 align:start position:0%
the stamp
yeah

06:04:14.230 --> 06:04:14.240 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:04:19.110 --> 06:04:19.120 align:start position:0%
yes what percent of all tobacco products
 
06:04:26.350 --> 06:04:26.360 align:start position:0%
goes to uh the PTO yeah
 
06:04:31.430 --> 06:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
now so only the stamp Revenue goes to
 
06:04:36.310 --> 06:04:36.320 align:start position:0%
the ETF currently none of the OT PP or
 
06:04:38.270 --> 06:04:38.280 align:start position:0%
ecigarette Revenue goes to the ETF
 
06:04:41.548 --> 06:04:41.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:41.558 --> 06:04:44.070 align:start position:0%
 
43.8

06:04:44.070 --> 06:04:44.080 align:start position:0%
43.8
 
06:04:47.030 --> 06:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
so if this were to
 
06:04:49.430 --> 06:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
pass we would then be
 
06:04:49.440 --> 06:04:53.110 align:start position:0%
pass we would then be
taxing

06:04:53.110 --> 06:04:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:56.708 --> 06:04:56.718 align:start position:0%
everything and 30 and 34% of everything
 
06:05:00.350 --> 06:05:00.360 align:start position:0%
we tax would be going to the
 
06:05:00.360 --> 06:05:01.868 align:start position:0%
we tax would be going to the
ETF

06:05:01.868 --> 06:05:01.878 align:start position:0%
ETF
 
06:05:04.990 --> 06:05:05.000 align:start position:0%
correct you have a different shift for
 
06:05:07.628 --> 06:05:07.638 align:start position:0%
the two types of products it's a
 
06:05:34.628 --> 06:05:34.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:37.990 --> 06:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
43.82720 revenue from
 
06:05:41.150 --> 06:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
cigarettes I think T the tobacco stamp
 
06:05:44.150 --> 06:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
right for cigarettes only that Revenue a
 
06:05:46.350 --> 06:05:46.360 align:start position:0%
portion of that gets distributed to the
 
06:05:50.070 --> 06:05:50.080 align:start position:0%
ETF yes the revenue from vaping
 
06:05:53.990 --> 06:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
from uh other tobacco products all goes
 
06:05:56.150 --> 06:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
directly into the general fund correct
 
06:05:57.708 --> 06:05:57.718 align:start position:0%
the 100% of that goes to the general
 
06:05:57.718 --> 06:05:59.990 align:start position:0%
the 100% of that goes to the general
fund

06:05:59.990 --> 06:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
fund
 
06:06:03.948 --> 06:06:03.958 align:start position:0%
yeah that then means that the
 
06:06:06.430 --> 06:06:06.440 align:start position:0%
department would have to figure out some
 
06:06:08.270 --> 06:06:08.280 align:start position:0%
way to
 
06:06:13.230 --> 06:06:13.240 align:start position:0%
tax affirmatively tax The Vape products
 
06:06:16.628 --> 06:06:16.638 align:start position:0%
we we do currently tax The Vape products
 
06:06:19.310 --> 06:06:19.320 align:start position:0%
we tax open and closed systems
 
06:06:21.468 --> 06:06:21.478 align:start position:0%
differently um one is a percentage of
 
06:06:23.310 --> 06:06:23.320 align:start position:0%
the wholesale price and the other is a
 
06:06:26.070 --> 06:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
price per milliliter those products are
 
06:06:29.350 --> 06:06:29.360 align:start position:0%
currently taxed none of the revenue from
 
06:06:32.230 --> 06:06:32.240 align:start position:0%
those products goes to the ETF currently
 
06:06:36.510 --> 06:06:36.520 align:start position:0%
the language in hb2 doesn't imp the rate
 
06:06:40.270 --> 06:06:40.280 align:start position:0%
of tax at all it only impacts how much
 
06:06:42.830 --> 06:06:42.840 align:start position:0%
is distributed to which of the
 
06:06:46.910 --> 06:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
funds okay so that's so yeah so that's
 
06:06:48.948 --> 06:06:48.958 align:start position:0%
increasing the rate of distribution into
 
06:06:52.590 --> 06:06:52.600 align:start position:0%
the TF front from other tobacco products
 
06:06:56.270 --> 06:06:56.280 align:start position:0%
correct yes but you're also
 
06:06:58.830 --> 06:06:58.840 align:start position:0%
cutting the rate of distribution from
 
06:07:01.390 --> 06:07:01.400 align:start position:0%
the tobacco from cigarettes so if you
 
06:07:04.628 --> 06:07:04.638 align:start position:0%
look at the sh at the chart from Dr if
 
06:07:07.070 --> 06:07:07.080 align:start position:0%
you look at the page page where is
 
06:07:11.230 --> 06:07:11.240 align:start position:0%
it if you look at at page three it's not
 
06:07:15.468 --> 06:07:15.478 align:start position:0%
numbered but if you look at page three
 
06:07:15.478 --> 06:07:17.468 align:start position:0%
numbered but if you look at page three
hb2

06:07:17.468 --> 06:07:17.478 align:start position:0%
hb2
 
06:07:17.478 --> 06:07:19.310 align:start position:0%
hb2
would

06:07:19.310 --> 06:07:19.320 align:start position:0%
would
 
06:07:24.190 --> 06:07:24.200 align:start position:0%
uh would cost the ETF distribution would
 
06:07:28.070 --> 06:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
would uh decrement the ETF distribution
 
06:07:31.110 --> 06:07:31.120 align:start position:0%
by $18 million based on current
 
06:07:34.830 --> 06:07:34.840 align:start position:0%
numbers but it would add because it
 
06:07:37.070 --> 06:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
would now have a distribution for vaping
 
06:07:39.310 --> 06:07:39.320 align:start position:0%
and for other tobacco products it would
 
06:07:39.320 --> 06:07:40.510 align:start position:0%
and for other tobacco products it would
add

06:07:40.510 --> 06:07:40.520 align:start position:0%
add
 
06:07:40.520 --> 06:07:42.670 align:start position:0%
add
9.9

06:07:42.670 --> 06:07:42.680 align:start position:0%
9.9
 
06:07:45.590 --> 06:07:45.600 align:start position:0%
million resulting in a
 
06:07:48.510 --> 06:07:48.520 align:start position:0%
total uh decrement to the education
 
06:07:51.830 --> 06:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
trust fund of 8.1 million is that am I
 
06:07:53.590 --> 06:07:53.600 align:start position:0%
reading your chart correctly you have it
 
06:07:58.548 --> 06:07:58.558 align:start position:0%
correct yes so in the end what hb2 is
 
06:08:01.590 --> 06:08:01.600 align:start position:0%
proposing with the tobacco tax with the
 
06:08:03.868 --> 06:08:03.878 align:start position:0%
other tobacco products tax with the
 
06:08:05.990 --> 06:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
business profits tax with the be
 
06:08:10.670 --> 06:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
with everything else is to cut education
 
06:08:14.390 --> 06:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund by n about $95
 
06:08:17.670 --> 06:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
million based on
 
06:08:21.670 --> 06:08:21.680 align:start position:0%
plan all four taxes combined assuming
 
06:08:23.750 --> 06:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
plan is the revenue base we use you're
 
06:08:25.868 --> 06:08:25.878 align:start position:0%
correct right if you go to the last page
 
06:08:28.310 --> 06:08:28.320 align:start position:0%
of that of that
 
06:08:31.030 --> 06:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
chart the education trust fund would
 
06:08:33.948 --> 06:08:33.958 align:start position:0%
under hb2 education trust fund would
 
06:08:36.670 --> 06:08:36.680 align:start position:0%
lose 61.7
 
06:08:40.670 --> 06:08:40.680 align:start position:0%
million uh from BPT based compared to
 
06:08:42.788 --> 06:08:42.798 align:start position:0%
the current law all right that would
 
06:08:46.590 --> 06:08:46.600 align:start position:0%
lose $26.5 million from the current you
 
06:08:48.708 --> 06:08:48.718 align:start position:0%
know based on the current law from
 
06:08:51.788 --> 06:08:51.798 align:start position:0%
BET and then it would lose about $8
 
06:08:54.110 --> 06:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
million from tobacco
 
06:08:57.230 --> 06:08:57.240 align:start position:0%
products no no no I total in other words
 
06:08:59.150 --> 06:08:59.160 align:start position:0%
it loses $18 million from the tobacco
 
06:09:02.310 --> 06:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
stamp from cigarettes but it gains
 
06:09:06.510 --> 06:09:06.520 align:start position:0%
9.9 by Distributing Revenue for vaping
 
06:09:10.670 --> 06:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
and for other tobacco products into ETF
 
06:09:14.468 --> 06:09:14.478 align:start position:0%
resulting in a net loss to ETF from all
 
06:09:17.750 --> 06:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
tobacco products vaping cigarettes
 
06:09:21.430 --> 06:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
everything of about 8.1
 
06:09:24.948 --> 06:09:24.958 align:start position:0%
million and then I guess it
 
06:09:28.310 --> 06:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
gains 1.4 million from a change in the
 
06:09:30.230 --> 06:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
real estate transfer tax and I didn't
 
06:09:32.510 --> 06:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
look at what the change is but at any
 
06:09:35.788 --> 06:09:35.798 align:start position:0%
rate it the the total is a net l loss to
 
06:09:38.030 --> 06:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund based on
 
06:09:40.510 --> 06:09:40.520 align:start position:0%
current law of
 
06:09:40.520 --> 06:09:42.190 align:start position:0%
current law of
94.9

06:09:42.190 --> 06:09:42.200 align:start position:0%
94.9
 
06:09:44.510 --> 06:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
million which in my view is going in
 
06:09:48.510 --> 06:09:48.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:50.868 --> 06:09:50.878 align:start position:0%
direction I'm wondering if that's a
 
06:09:53.230 --> 06:09:53.240 align:start position:0%
result and I have no idea whether that's
 
06:09:56.230 --> 06:09:56.240 align:start position:0%
a result of the fact that the as I've as
 
06:09:57.788 --> 06:09:57.798 align:start position:0%
I've heard the education trust fund is
 
06:10:00.190 --> 06:10:00.200 align:start position:0%
running at about close to 100 million
 
06:10:03.270 --> 06:10:03.280 align:start position:0%
ahead maybe that's why she's chosen to
 
06:10:08.150 --> 06:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
do this um I I don't know just a
 
06:10:10.628 --> 06:10:10.638 align:start position:0%
thought but given given where we are now
 
06:10:12.628 --> 06:10:12.638 align:start position:0%
I mean we need to wrap up we another
 
06:10:13.990 --> 06:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
couple people had to leave because of
 
06:10:17.990 --> 06:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
timing um I I unless someone has a
 
06:10:19.948 --> 06:10:19.958 align:start position:0%
concrete reason for changing this right
 
06:10:24.788 --> 06:10:24.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:26.948 --> 06:10:26.958 align:start position:0%
anything this is from the governor
 
06:10:28.628 --> 06:10:28.638 align:start position:0%
correct and it's we're sending it over
 
06:10:30.350 --> 06:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
to finance yeah it's going to get why
 
06:10:32.468 --> 06:10:32.478 align:start position:0%
don't we just let go back to the
 
06:10:35.628 --> 06:10:35.638 align:start position:0%
original numbers 4141 whatever and let
 
06:10:37.910 --> 06:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
Finance make that deter our
 
06:10:40.548 --> 06:10:40.558 align:start position:0%
recommendation be we stay at 41
 
06:10:43.910 --> 06:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
41 and whatever Susan has ranking member
 
06:10:47.110 --> 06:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
had said it was 43.8 whatever that was
 
06:10:52.030 --> 06:10:52.040 align:start position:0%
and just let Finance then take the
 
06:10:55.590 --> 06:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
H if they make a
 
06:11:02.548 --> 06:11:02.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:07.430 --> 06:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:09.230 --> 06:11:09.240 align:start position:0%
the recommendation on page 72 is to go
 
06:11:10.708 --> 06:11:10.718 align:start position:0%
back to the
 
06:11:14.070 --> 06:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
4141 43.8 I think is
 
06:11:17.350 --> 06:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
what okay great anything
 
06:11:17.360 --> 06:11:22.670 align:start position:0%
what okay great anything
else

06:11:22.670 --> 06:11:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:26.110 --> 06:11:26.120 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
06:11:28.510 --> 06:11:28.520 align:start position:0%
um even though on the last page Mr
 
06:11:29.910 --> 06:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
chairman I see they're going to charge
 
06:11:32.708 --> 06:11:32.718 align:start position:0%
the counties more in the long run I
 
06:11:36.670 --> 06:11:36.680 align:start position:0%
think on on line four on the page 7 3 it
 
06:11:40.670 --> 06:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
looks to me like the housing
 
06:11:43.070 --> 06:11:43.080 align:start position:0%
fund is no
 
06:11:43.080 --> 06:11:45.830 align:start position:0%
fund is no
longer

06:11:45.830 --> 06:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
longer
 
06:11:49.830 --> 06:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
funded which um I
 
06:11:51.868 --> 06:11:51.878 align:start position:0%
don't because that's that I mean I
 
06:11:53.830 --> 06:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
looked it up that's what that is RSA 78
 
06:11:56.670 --> 06:11:56.680 align:start position:0%
B13 is money going to the housing fund
 
06:11:58.070 --> 06:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
so it seems like the housing fund's
 
06:12:02.230 --> 06:12:02.240 align:start position:0%
going away um so maybe
 
06:12:05.708 --> 06:12:05.718 align:start position:0%
maybe am
 
06:12:09.070 --> 06:12:09.080 align:start position:0%
it's it's only five million yeah should
 
06:12:11.310 --> 06:12:11.320 align:start position:0%
we so do we want to recommend that we
 
06:12:14.150 --> 06:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
not do that yeah we might as well we
 
06:12:18.510 --> 06:12:18.520 align:start position:0%
don't care I mean we're Revenue they us
 
06:12:21.070 --> 06:12:21.080 align:start position:0%
not distribution that's a distribution
 
06:12:24.390 --> 06:12:24.400 align:start position:0%
argument yeah that's true that's true
 
06:12:26.150 --> 06:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
that's just the back half of that's
 
06:12:27.430 --> 06:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
that's a good point that's actually not
 
06:12:30.948 --> 06:12:30.958 align:start position:0%
our not our committee yeah okay um all
 
06:12:32.830 --> 06:12:32.840 align:start position:0%
right so I'm going to close the uh work
 
06:12:33.948 --> 06:12:33.958 align:start position:0%
session on
 
06:12:38.350 --> 06:12:38.360 align:start position:0%
hb2 and and uh so for next week for
 
06:12:39.548 --> 06:12:39.558 align:start position:0%
those of you wondering what we're doing
 
06:12:42.230 --> 06:12:42.240 align:start position:0%
next week representative
 
06:12:44.788 --> 06:12:44.798 align:start position:0%
SP okay next week we'll probably I'm
 
06:12:47.230 --> 06:12:47.240 align:start position:0%
probably scheduling Tuesday the 18th
 
06:12:49.430 --> 06:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
Tuesday Yeah Tuesday the 18th Tuesday
 
06:12:55.110 --> 06:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:57.868 --> 06:12:57.878 align:start position:0%
that yeah I didn't want to schedule
 
06:12:59.990 --> 06:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
today M today we had a problem with
 
06:13:01.830 --> 06:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
people being able to attend but this you
 
06:13:04.548 --> 06:13:04.558 align:start position:0%
know tomorrow's election day and the
 
06:13:06.030 --> 06:13:06.040 align:start position:0%
speaker asked us not to schedule
 
06:13:07.868 --> 06:13:07.878 align:start position:0%
meetings on Tuesday because ordinar I
 
06:13:11.150 --> 06:13:11.160 align:start position:0%
would have scheduled it tomorrow um so
 
06:13:14.070 --> 06:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
anyways that's uh yeah so I'll schedule
 
06:13:15.110 --> 06:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
I don't know what's going to be on the
 
06:13:17.390 --> 06:13:17.400 align:start position:0%
schedule yet other than there's I think
 
06:13:19.670 --> 06:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
there's two or three new bills we're
 
06:13:21.628 --> 06:13:21.638 align:start position:0%
going to have to have public hearings on
 
06:13:24.430 --> 06:13:24.440 align:start position:0%
so there'll be public hearings I
 
06:13:26.990 --> 06:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
think yeah well we we are debating is it
 
06:13:29.070 --> 06:13:29.080 align:start position:0%
three new ones or four and minus one I
 
06:13:31.628 --> 06:13:31.638 align:start position:0%
don't know so we're gonna have I think
 
06:13:33.270 --> 06:13:33.280 align:start position:0%
there's only two new bills we'll have
 
06:13:35.548 --> 06:13:35.558 align:start position:0%
public hearings on those
 
06:13:40.070 --> 06:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
we'll um I don't know what to do with uh
 
06:13:43.548 --> 06:13:43.558 align:start position:0%
728 um we could do a work session on
 
06:13:46.628 --> 06:13:46.638 align:start position:0%
that um the following week is the last
 
06:13:50.270 --> 06:13:50.280 align:start position:0%
week we have to get well yes all the
 
06:13:51.708 --> 06:13:51.718 align:start position:0%
I'll have to look at that if there's a
 
06:13:54.548 --> 06:13:54.558 align:start position:0%
bill that has to be out by uh the 20th
 
06:13:57.350 --> 06:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
then we have to exec that next week um
 
06:13:58.830 --> 06:13:58.840 align:start position:0%
and then there's a couple those second
 
06:14:00.788 --> 06:14:00.798 align:start position:0%
committee bills that we got we could
 
06:14:03.310 --> 06:14:03.320 align:start position:0%
actually exect those the following week
 
06:14:05.390 --> 06:14:05.400 align:start position:0%
I won't be here that following week the
 
06:14:09.830 --> 06:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
20 whatever it is 5th 6 26th Jordan will
 
06:14:11.548 --> 06:14:11.558 align:start position:0%
probably chair the meeting and it
 
06:14:14.788 --> 06:14:14.798 align:start position:0%
probably will just consist of executing
 
06:14:17.230 --> 06:14:17.240 align:start position:0%
one or two bills so I I it's probably a
 
06:14:20.310 --> 06:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
half a day meeting but anyways that's so
 
06:14:21.708 --> 06:14:21.718 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much a schedule as far as
 
06:14:23.230 --> 06:14:23.240 align:start position:0%
I can see right now probably Tuesday the
 
06:14:25.548 --> 06:14:25.558 align:start position:0%
18th and probably do you prefer Tuesday
 
06:14:31.390 --> 06:14:31.400 align:start position:0%
the 25th 10 o' yeah yeah
 
06:14:35.270 --> 06:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
and 25th uh is the Tuesday yeah yeah
 
06:14:37.948 --> 06:14:37.958 align:start position:0%
yeah so probably the Tuesday and Tuesday
 
06:14:40.030 --> 06:14:40.040 align:start position:0%
starting at 10 o'clock and I won't be
 
06:14:42.750 --> 06:14:42.760 align:start position:0%
here for the second Tuesday um but we'll
 
06:14:44.750 --> 06:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
still have a meeting we'll see how
 
06:14:44.760 --> 06:14:46.070 align:start position:0%
still have a meeting we'll see how

Jordan
 
06:14:49.190 --> 06:14:49.200 align:start position:0%
does he'll do he'll do
 
06:14:51.590 --> 06:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
fine whatever whatever you feel needs to
 
06:14:53.830 --> 06:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
be done no I preer
 
06:15:03.948 --> 06:15:03.958 align:start position:0%
