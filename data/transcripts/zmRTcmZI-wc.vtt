open up our
 
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:03.160 align:start position:0%
full committee work
 
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
session uh we've got two bills
 
00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:10.200 align:start position:0%
listed um House Bill 1273 FN and House
 
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.389 align:start position:0%
listed um House Bill 1273 FN and House
Bill

00:09:12.389 --> 00:09:12.399 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
1637 to try to make some some uh seating
 
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
available um it's been agreed basically
 
00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:23.560 align:start position:0%
we gave uh originally talked about an
 
00:09:25.389 --> 00:09:25.399 align:start position:0%
interim study on H Bill
 
00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:27.720 align:start position:0%
1273 uh we decided to give it a few more
 
00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:30.360 align:start position:0%
weeks and came up with more Road blocks
 
00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:32.600 align:start position:0%
so we are going to be moving forward the
 
00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:35.560 align:start position:0%
executive session with an interim study
 
00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:37.000 align:start position:0%
again so there's not really anything to
 
00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:39.880 align:start position:0%
talk about in the work session for
 
00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:44.360 align:start position:0%
1273 so um on 16 House Bill
 
00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
1637 relative to reducing requirements
 
00:09:48.949 --> 00:09:48.959 align:start position:0%
for vehicle inspections I'd like to
 
00:09:51.949 --> 00:09:51.959 align:start position:0%
reach out and thank representative sers
 
00:09:54.829 --> 00:09:54.839 align:start position:0%
for doing all the leg work um who did
 
00:09:57.949 --> 00:09:57.959 align:start position:0%
email out to the committee yesterday uh
 
00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
after talking um
 
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
actually several times on this uh this
 
00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
is a a draft a suggested draft U that uh
 
00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
we came up with and I think it takes out
 
00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:14.200 align:start position:0%
some of the onerous things uh in
 
00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:16.200 align:start position:0%
particular actually you know what I'll
 
00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:18.440 align:start position:0%
let representative sers explain this
 
00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
he's he's had his head into it more than
 
00:10:23.949 --> 00:10:23.959 align:start position:0%
I all right thank you Mr chair and
 
00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:25.720 align:start position:0%
instead of going back to the original
 
00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:27.560 align:start position:0%
yes it did take out uh one of the main
 
00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:29.560 align:start position:0%
things it took out is uh renewing your
 
00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:33.160 align:start position:0%
license uh on the day uh that uh excuse
 
00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
me renewing your inspection um maybe
 
00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:38.360 align:start position:0%
when you buy the car at that point
 
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
instead of on your your licensed birth
 
00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:42.920 align:start position:0%
month at that point so that's one of the
 
00:10:45.629 --> 00:10:45.639 align:start position:0%
big areas that was taken out uh another
 
00:10:48.269 --> 00:10:48.279 align:start position:0%
area was taken out which was on uh the
 
00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
very back but it had to do with um uh
 
00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:54.720 align:start position:0%
broken door latches you know at that
 
00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:56.440 align:start position:0%
point so because we want to make sure
 
00:10:57.829 --> 00:10:57.839 align:start position:0%
people can get in and out of their
 
00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
counter rank so let me just go over the
 
00:11:03.389 --> 00:11:03.399 align:start position:0%
uh first few things here the first
 
00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
section is new uh you know where the
 
00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:08.560 align:start position:0%
department shall not require an
 
00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
inspection station perform inspections
 
00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
within any uh minimum maximum amount of
 
00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
time I mean that that on number one is
 
00:11:19.829 --> 00:11:19.839 align:start position:0%
new uh section number two on line eight
 
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh amended and the amendment part here
 
00:11:25.629 --> 00:11:25.639 align:start position:0%
is going from either a 10day or a 20-day
 
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
and just going consistently with 30 days
 
00:11:31.269 --> 00:11:31.279 align:start position:0%
throughout it so on line
 
00:11:36.269 --> 00:11:36.279 align:start position:0%
12 and on line 18 this is on page one
 
00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:39.959 align:start position:0%
and also on line 20 all right so that's
 
00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
that's what's being changed there the
 
00:11:45.509 --> 00:11:45.519 align:start position:0%
third uh number three section here um is
 
00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:48.440 align:start position:0%
a change as well and again trying to be
 
00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
consistent with 30 days so this is a if
 
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:53.720 align:start position:0%
they uh have a failure here they have 30
 
00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
days to get it corrected and especially
 
00:11:58.509 --> 00:11:58.519 align:start position:0%
with the garages today it's stuff I'm
 
00:12:00.269 --> 00:12:00.279 align:start position:0%
finding it very difficult I have to
 
00:12:02.509 --> 00:12:02.519 align:start position:0%
schedule my car two weeks out and I'm
 
00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
saying I need to have a spare car just
 
00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
to have a car you know a vehicle to get
 
00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
around so we need this extra time and
 
00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
also for those folks that might not have
 
00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
the the actual means of just putting the
 
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
car in the shop and have to work on it
 
00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
themselves they need a little extra time
 
00:12:22.509 --> 00:12:22.519 align:start position:0%
to do that work as well especially where
 
00:12:24.509 --> 00:12:24.519 align:start position:0%
those are procrastinators and they wait
 
00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
until maybe the last day of inspection
 
00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:29.320 align:start position:0%
and they get it in there finally and and
 
00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:31.480 align:start position:0%
out it fails so that's that's some of
 
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
the reasons for those changes number
 
00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
four is a new section there again just
 
00:12:39.189 --> 00:12:39.199 align:start position:0%
aligning in this case the first one was
 
00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:41.720 align:start position:0%
departments this one is now it says new
 
00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officers shall uh shall
 
00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
require inspections within any it shall
 
00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
I wonder if that's a mistake but I'll
 
00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
check that out I thought I thought maybe
 
00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:51.720 align:start position:0%
it should be shall not require
 
00:12:53.389 --> 00:12:53.399 align:start position:0%
inspections with any minimum maximum
 
00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:55.880 align:start position:0%
amount of time so I'm going to just
 
00:12:59.670 --> 00:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
question on line three on page
 
00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
too um just to verify that that is
 
00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
should be shall or shall not all right
 
00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:11.000 align:start position:0%
uh on Section Five it's a change and the
 
00:13:15.389 --> 00:13:15.399 align:start position:0%
change is down on uh line 26 27 and
 
00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
possibly 28 the one thing it had in
 
00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:19.480 align:start position:0%
there is they had one word in there
 
00:13:21.949 --> 00:13:21.959 align:start position:0%
linear all right that word linear was
 
00:13:24.509 --> 00:13:24.519 align:start position:0%
taken out so it's just cracks all right
 
00:13:27.269 --> 00:13:27.279 align:start position:0%
because you could have you know a a a
 
00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:29.160 align:start position:0%
diagonal crack or whatever at that point
 
00:13:32.269 --> 00:13:32.279 align:start position:0%
Point yet the you know that's just the
 
00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
casing the directional still
 
00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
works um number six um or that was the
 
00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
headlamp section number six is the uh
 
00:13:46.069 --> 00:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
directionals uh same idea um looking at
 
00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
line 37 going on to the next
 
00:13:54.629 --> 00:13:54.639 align:start position:0%
page page three one two and three um all
 
00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:57.320 align:start position:0%
right so that is
 
00:13:59.550 --> 00:13:59.560 align:start position:0%
there and
 
00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:02.720 align:start position:0%
number seven is a change again they I
 
00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
took on on line seven uh it used to say
 
00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
linear cracks linear cracks no it just
 
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.269 align:start position:0%
linear cracks linear cracks no it just
says

00:14:10.269 --> 00:14:10.279 align:start position:0%
says
 
00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
cracks um
 
00:14:16.389 --> 00:14:16.399 align:start position:0%
section8 is new we've added uh 58b
 
00:14:16.399 --> 00:14:17.389 align:start position:0%
section8 is new we've added uh 58b
window

00:14:17.389 --> 00:14:17.399 align:start position:0%
window
 
00:14:20.629 --> 00:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
functions all right uh no vehicle shall
 
00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:23.000 align:start position:0%
fail inspection due to a inability of a
 
00:14:24.949 --> 00:14:24.959 align:start position:0%
window to open or
 
00:14:28.269 --> 00:14:28.279 align:start position:0%
close all right number nine uh this is
 
00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:29.680 align:start position:0%
under ruem
 
00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
or a change to that adding rule
 
00:14:36.509 --> 00:14:36.519 align:start position:0%
118 all right it says no rule
 
00:14:39.189 --> 00:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
shall uh require inspection failure when
 
00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:41.000 align:start position:0%
there are cracks in any of the
 
00:14:44.189 --> 00:14:44.199 align:start position:0%
functional headlamps or
 
00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:47.320 align:start position:0%
reflectors 10 uh has to do with the
 
00:14:50.069 --> 00:14:50.079 align:start position:0%
brakes um representative Walsh had a
 
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
separate Amendment he's going to do The
 
00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:53.560 align:start position:0%
Brak Po and I've added it all into this
 
00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
one amendment to make everything all all
 
00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
inclusive again looking at line
 
00:15:05.509 --> 00:15:05.519 align:start position:0%
24 uh through 36 here and I'm going to
 
00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
say most of this stuff came out of rules
 
00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:09.800 align:start position:0%
and and uh maybe representative Walsh
 
00:15:11.829 --> 00:15:11.839 align:start position:0%
can talk about some of that but the they
 
00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
definitely uh lines 25
 
00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
27 um I'm going to say all this stuff
 
00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:20.600 align:start position:0%
actually came out of rules unless
 
00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:22.040 align:start position:0%
representative was wants to add a little
 
00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:24.440 align:start position:0%
more to that and that goes on to the
 
00:15:27.189 --> 00:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
last page uh
 
00:15:31.629 --> 00:15:31.639 align:start position:0%
again at that point just uh
 
00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:35.800 align:start position:0%
changes uh page four 1 through
 
00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:38.720 align:start position:0%
7 and lastly it would take effect 60
 
00:15:40.389 --> 00:15:40.399 align:start position:0%
days after
 
00:15:43.309 --> 00:15:43.319 align:start position:0%
passage so hopefully I explained most of
 
00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:45.880 align:start position:0%
it and I'll I'll take some questions
 
00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:48.160 align:start position:0%
what I can
 
00:15:50.269 --> 00:15:50.279 align:start position:0%
answer thank you representative and
 
00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:52.360 align:start position:0%
before I go to questions I will
 
00:15:54.829 --> 00:15:54.839 align:start position:0%
reiterate sections line well line 24
 
00:15:57.870 --> 00:15:57.880 align:start position:0%
through 36 on page three and on the back
 
00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
page page four uh the majority of that
 
00:16:01.829 --> 00:16:01.839 align:start position:0%
is from Rules just putting into the
 
00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
statute uh the reason for the change I
 
00:16:07.309 --> 00:16:07.319 align:start position:0%
don't know about you but the I receive
 
00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:09.480 align:start position:0%
countless and countless and countless
 
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
complaints every year over the word rust
 
00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.110 align:start position:0%
complaints every year over the word rust
on

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
rotors and it was the way it's in rules
 
00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
it's just very subjective so we looked
 
00:16:20.509 --> 00:16:20.519 align:start position:0%
at it and I said well why don't we just
 
00:16:22.389 --> 00:16:22.399 align:start position:0%
remove the word rust because the the
 
00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:25.720 align:start position:0%
mirror presence of rust isn't good cause
 
00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
for failing pitting is and so and you
 
00:16:31.269 --> 00:16:31.279 align:start position:0%
you can't have pitting without rest so
 
00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
so we left the pitting and just took the
 
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
subjective word rest out essentially
 
00:16:37.069 --> 00:16:37.079 align:start position:0%
keeping everything else the same uh the
 
00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:38.440 align:start position:0%
first draft of the amendment I saw
 
00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:41.160 align:start position:0%
didn't look at the Linings or or or
 
00:16:43.749 --> 00:16:43.759 align:start position:0%
shoes or pads but this one does and
 
00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
it'll all um be included in RSA 26628
 
00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:49.880 align:start position:0%
which already does have a break section
 
00:16:52.269 --> 00:16:52.279 align:start position:0%
on it so that was the reason for it just
 
00:16:54.189 --> 00:16:54.199 align:start position:0%
to remove some of the subjectivity
 
00:16:56.629 --> 00:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
because you can buy a brand new vehicle
 
00:16:57.990 --> 00:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
and just because it's got a little
 
00:16:59.629 --> 00:16:59.639 align:start position:0%
orange on the road doesn't mean there's
 
00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
anything wrong with it the only time
 
00:17:02.829 --> 00:17:02.839 align:start position:0%
there's a problem from what we can see
 
00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:05.079 align:start position:0%
is if it's cracked or if it really does
 
00:17:06.949 --> 00:17:06.959 align:start position:0%
diminish stopping power if there's
 
00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
issues with the friction surface
 
00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
itself um so with that being said go
 
00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:15.160 align:start position:0%
ribs and sellers yeah I just have one
 
00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
more add here on page to actually on
 
00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:19.710 align:start position:0%
more add here on page to actually on
line

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:19.720 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:22.240 align:start position:0%
26 uh since uh the chair mentioned
 
00:17:25.309 --> 00:17:25.319 align:start position:0%
roster we we did uh cross off rust there
 
00:17:27.830 --> 00:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
so just want to point that
 
00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
out thank you sir representative
 
00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
Hill thank you Mr chairman um I have a
 
00:17:37.789 --> 00:17:37.799 align:start position:0%
question about uh L uh page one I guess
 
00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
line five through 7 and what does that
 
00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:46.120 align:start position:0%
do that page two line 3 through five
 
00:17:56.029 --> 00:17:56.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:58.350 --> 00:17:58.360 align:start position:0%
thing could I ask you to repeat that I
 
00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:01.320 align:start position:0%
didn't hear the the last part um L page
 
00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
two 3 through
 
00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:09.240 align:start position:0%
five and page one line 5 through 7 I
 
00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:11.320 align:start position:0%
think I thought it looks to me like
 
00:18:13.909 --> 00:18:13.919 align:start position:0%
they're doing the same thing yeah one
 
00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:16.120 align:start position:0%
one is departments the key word there is
 
00:18:17.669 --> 00:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
departments the other one is law
 
00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement and and again on page two I
 
00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
had Circle the uh where it says law
 
00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:27.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer shall require I'm
 
00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
wondering if that's supposed to say
 
00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
shall not require as on page
 
00:18:35.669 --> 00:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
one on line five it says departments
 
00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:40.840 align:start position:0%
require once once's law enforcement
 
00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:42.750 align:start position:0%
require once once's law enforcement
once's

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:42.760 align:start position:0%
once's
 
00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
department we need both I don't
 
00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
know um that those both came from the
 
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
original bill so I guess it's up to us
 
00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:53.240 align:start position:0%
whether we think we need both or if they
 
00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
could be both mentioned in the same
 
00:18:58.430 --> 00:18:58.440 align:start position:0%
paragraph um or if they're needed at all
 
00:18:59.789 --> 00:18:59.799 align:start position:0%
that's that's why we're having this
 
00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
exercise now so
 
00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
um I think though if we do decide to
 
00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:06.520 align:start position:0%
leave it the way it is I do agree that
 
00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
the knot should be added for the page
 
00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:13.400 align:start position:0%
two lines three through five but just my
 
00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:16.600 align:start position:0%
take on it at this point any other
 
00:19:18.909 --> 00:19:18.919 align:start position:0%
thoughts representative Jack uh thank
 
00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
you I'm going to push back a little bit
 
00:19:23.669 --> 00:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
on the page two because the difference
 
00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:25.960 align:start position:0%
is that on page on line three it starts
 
00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:27.720 align:start position:0%
out with the word
 
00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:31.669 align:start position:0%
out with the word
no

00:19:31.669 --> 00:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:38.360 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I'm wondering if if I may
 
00:19:40.149 --> 00:19:40.159 align:start position:0%
yeah go ahead um I wondering if we
 
00:19:42.029 --> 00:19:42.039 align:start position:0%
should actually just add the law
 
00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
enforcement part to page one line five
 
00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
department and law enforcement and just
 
00:19:48.669 --> 00:19:48.679 align:start position:0%
get rid
 
00:19:52.029 --> 00:19:52.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:52.039 --> 00:19:53.549 align:start position:0%
 
two

00:19:53.549 --> 00:19:53.559 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
um that actually number four alog
 
00:19:59.390 --> 00:19:59.400 align:start position:0%
together that section
 
00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
well if we are okay with the intent
 
00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:08.120 align:start position:0%
of paragraph Roman three on page two and
 
00:20:12.669 --> 00:20:12.679 align:start position:0%
the intent of Roman 8 I mean 13 that's
 
00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:14.600 align:start position:0%
not going to require another amendment
 
00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:16.559 align:start position:0%
if we leave it the way it is if we want
 
00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
to move it and just add law enforcement
 
00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:21.880 align:start position:0%
to line five then we'll have to go back
 
00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
to OS but again it's all what it's this
 
00:20:26.789 --> 00:20:26.799 align:start position:0%
is what we as a committee think we
 
00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:28.799 align:start position:0%
should be doing that's just my opinion
 
00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
representative C I just noticed that
 
00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:32.720 align:start position:0%
both of these are listed as new
 
00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
paragraphs so they are not in
 
00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:38.840 align:start position:0%
existing uh law so we would have to
 
00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
decide whether to correct that or not or
 
00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:44.840 align:start position:0%
to merge them because we can't just
 
00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:49.230 align:start position:0%
to merge them because we can't just
ignore

00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:49.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:53.000 align:start position:0%
it section one and section four are both
 
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:53.909 align:start position:0%
it section one and section four are both
new

00:20:53.909 --> 00:20:53.919 align:start position:0%
new
 
00:20:57.789 --> 00:20:57.799 align:start position:0%
paragraphs yeah but that's okay so long
 
00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
as they so as long as they're written
 
00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.549 align:start position:0%
as they so as long as they're written
correctly

00:21:02.549 --> 00:21:02.559 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
00:21:04.789 --> 00:21:04.799 align:start position:0%
any we'll take a look at it though we'll
 
00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:08.440 align:start position:0%
continue to I I did notice that uh page
 
00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
one that part one that goes in U uh RSA
 
00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:15.269 align:start position:0%
one that part one that goes in U uh RSA
266

00:21:15.269 --> 00:21:15.279 align:start position:0%
266
 
00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
colon I guess that's a one it says
 
00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:23.720 align:start position:0%
I uh whereas um the other one is in a
 
00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:25.029 align:start position:0%
I uh whereas um the other one is in a
different

00:21:25.029 --> 00:21:25.039 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:34.120 align:start position:0%
61a and that may be an error on the
 
00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
first one have showing a Roman eye
 
00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:36.909 align:start position:0%
first one have showing a Roman eye
instead

00:21:36.909 --> 00:21:36.919 align:start position:0%
instead
 
00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
of the number
 
00:21:41.549 --> 00:21:41.559 align:start position:0%
one we'll confirm that in a minute may
 
00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
not it may or may not be any other
 
00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:48.640 align:start position:0%
thoughts of yeah go ahead y
 
00:21:52.029 --> 00:21:52.039 align:start position:0%
um I don't recall but maybe I'm just not
 
00:21:56.029 --> 00:21:56.039 align:start position:0%
recalling do we normally require the
 
00:21:58.870 --> 00:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
department not to do something and law
 
00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
enforcement not to do something or do we
 
00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
just assume that if the department says
 
00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
don't do it law enforcement follows the
 
00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
Department or vice versa is is it normal
 
00:22:14.029 --> 00:22:14.039 align:start position:0%
to have both items that's a great
 
00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
question beats me oh we can look into
 
00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
it how about our resident expert over
 
00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:33.750 align:start position:0%
 
it

00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:35.149 --> 00:22:35.159 align:start position:0%
did you have something
 
00:22:35.159 --> 00:22:37.830 align:start position:0%
did you have something
represent

00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:22:41.149 --> 00:22:41.159 align:start position:0%
go okay um my question is on the term
 
00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
cracks in the two sections uh is there a
 
00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
point where a crack can
 
00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
become to the point where it needs
 
00:22:50.789 --> 00:22:50.799 align:start position:0%
to be a factor in the inspection because
 
00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
this kind of like eliminates all cracks
 
00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
can a crack become significant enough
 
00:22:57.070 --> 00:22:57.080 align:start position:0%
that should this be limited to
 
00:22:59.789 --> 00:22:59.799 align:start position:0%
insignificant or minor crack
 
00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh is a spider crack that like makes the
 
00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:04.240 align:start position:0%
life flare and blind
 
00:23:08.549 --> 00:23:08.559 align:start position:0%
everybody a potential problem or I'm not
 
00:23:10.669 --> 00:23:10.679 align:start position:0%
sure I I think for me the reason this
 
00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
was put in the original Bill and and
 
00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
I'll ask repon sellers about the word
 
00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
lineal in a
 
00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
minute should the mere fact there's a
 
00:23:20.669 --> 00:23:20.679 align:start position:0%
crack there I don't think is an issue
 
00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:22.240 align:start position:0%
myself when a crack becomes so bad that
 
00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
it starts letting water in naturally the
 
00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:27.720 align:start position:0%
bulb is going to fail on its own um you
 
00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:29.480 align:start position:0%
can't a bulb will stay lit if it keeps
 
00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
getting wet um and I know it was put in
 
00:23:33.549 --> 00:23:33.559 align:start position:0%
just because of the sheer cost of these
 
00:23:36.269 --> 00:23:36.279 align:start position:0%
things with insignificant cracks however
 
00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
if we do put in a an adjective we're
 
00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
getting back to subjectivity again right
 
00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:42.950 align:start position:0%
getting back to subjectivity again right
so

00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
representes yeah thank you Mr chairman I
 
00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
I actually was hoping that we could ask
 
00:23:51.149 --> 00:23:51.159 align:start position:0%
someone in the audience about this
 
00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
because I I totally get that we don't
 
00:23:56.669 --> 00:23:56.679 align:start position:0%
want the water to get in and affect the
 
00:24:00.909 --> 00:24:00.919 align:start position:0%
headlights operation but not being a
 
00:24:06.149 --> 00:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
lighting expert I'm concerned that um if
 
00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:11.480 align:start position:0%
there's a crack does it change the
 
00:24:14.029 --> 00:24:14.039 align:start position:0%
directional way that the light projects
 
00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
out in front of the vehicle do you
 
00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:17.720 align:start position:0%
follow do you follow my question so I
 
00:24:19.149 --> 00:24:19.159 align:start position:0%
don't have the answer for that but I was
 
00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
hoping somebody might I'll invite
 
00:24:23.149 --> 00:24:23.159 align:start position:0%
anybody from the Department of Safety
 
00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
that's familiar with inspections if
 
00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:27.200 align:start position:0%
they'd like to ask a couple of questions
 
00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:44.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:45.230 align:start position:0%
 
good

00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:45.240 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:46.750 align:start position:0%
good
morning

00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:46.760 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:24:50.029 --> 00:24:50.039 align:start position:0%
um if I understand I still need you to
 
00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:52.360 align:start position:0%
introduce yourself I'm sorry I'm Carl
 
00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:54.360 align:start position:0%
holiston I'm a Staff Sergeant with State
 
00:24:58.710 --> 00:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
Police Troop G um we we oversee um
 
00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
inspection stations cardi I'm also in
 
00:25:03.909 --> 00:25:03.919 align:start position:0%
the motor carrier side of things as well
 
00:25:06.669 --> 00:25:06.679 align:start position:0%
so if I understand the question
 
00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:11.080 align:start position:0%
is about the statement that inhibit the
 
00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
ability for a light to project as
 
00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
prescribed in the section is that what
 
00:25:17.549 --> 00:25:17.559 align:start position:0%
we're asking I'm
 
00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:20.120 align:start position:0%
sorry I'll let represent SES re ask the
 
00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:22.640 align:start position:0%
question yeah so so what I'm trying to
 
00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:23.870 align:start position:0%
question yeah so so what I'm trying to
determine

00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
determine
 
00:25:26.669 --> 00:25:26.679 align:start position:0%
is obviously the whole point of
 
00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:29.200 align:start position:0%
headlights Beyond being a able to see
 
00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:32.600 align:start position:0%
more it part of the inspectional
 
00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:34.760 align:start position:0%
criteria I believe is that how they line
 
00:25:37.549 --> 00:25:37.559 align:start position:0%
up and and where they're directed The
 
00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:40.600 align:start position:0%
Beam is directed correct my concern is
 
00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:45.440 align:start position:0%
or question is does a crack in the lens
 
00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
then affect the way the beam projects
 
00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
and if it does then I'm a little
 
00:25:53.389 --> 00:25:53.399 align:start position:0%
concerned about this language so to
 
00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:56.440 align:start position:0%
answer your question both yes and
 
00:25:59.950 --> 00:25:59.960 align:start position:0%
no and and again that's the thing and I
 
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
I know you had talked about some a term
 
00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
or terms being subjective this would be
 
00:26:08.029 --> 00:26:08.039 align:start position:0%
one of them if it's in the dead center
 
00:26:11.909 --> 00:26:11.919 align:start position:0%
of it potentially no if it's on the edge
 
00:26:14.669 --> 00:26:14.679 align:start position:0%
potentially yes depending on where it is
 
00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
to drill down to the point where you
 
00:26:23.149 --> 00:26:23.159 align:start position:0%
define in
 
00:26:25.909 --> 00:26:25.919 align:start position:0%
this this one is acceptable this one is
 
00:26:29.789 --> 00:26:29.799 align:start position:0%
not would be extremely hard to do um but
 
00:26:32.149 --> 00:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
I I think the the term that you have in
 
00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
here which is um cracks in the headlamp
 
00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
or reflecting surface shall not cause
 
00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:41.480 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry um that inhibit the ability
 
00:26:44.549 --> 00:26:44.559 align:start position:0%
for light to project as described in the
 
00:26:47.149 --> 00:26:47.159 align:start position:0%
section that sort of clarifies a little
 
00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
bit but it's still subjective to the
 
00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
person that's actually conducting the
 
00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
inspection um and I agree some of these
 
00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:56.840 align:start position:0%
headlight assemblies are extremely
 
00:26:59.830 --> 00:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
expensive and just because it has a a
 
00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:04.120 align:start position:0%
crack in one area of it that is down to
 
00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
the left or something like that would
 
00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:08.720 align:start position:0%
not affect the safety of it Mr chairman
 
00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
may I have uh may I follow up with
 
00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:15.080 align:start position:0%
another sure um question of the the
 
00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
expert thank you um on page three on
 
00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:19.710 align:start position:0%
expert thank you um on page three on
line

00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:19.720 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:27:23.029 --> 00:27:23.039 align:start position:0%
34 I I understand why we're we're going
 
00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
to pitting but I'm worried about again
 
00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:30.200 align:start position:0%
the subjectiveness of what what is
 
00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:32.480 align:start position:0%
extensive and I don't know if that's an
 
00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:36.320 align:start position:0%
issue as well you know how do how would
 
00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:46.149 --> 00:27:46.159 align:start position:0%
that page line uh page three line 34 I
 
00:27:48.149 --> 00:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
believe it it talks about regarding uh
 
00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:50.200 align:start position:0%
breake drums and disc brake shell fail
 
00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
inspection only where the discs discs or
 
00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
drums show excessive mechanical damage
 
00:27:58.269 --> 00:27:58.279 align:start position:0%
other than wear and show evidence of
 
00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:01.320 align:start position:0%
elimination or excessive pitting on the
 
00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:03.320 align:start position:0%
friction surfaces
 
00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:06.640 align:start position:0%
surface such that it would either affect
 
00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
the proper brake operation except that
 
00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:10.720 align:start position:0%
Rush shall not be a reason for
 
00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:13.149 align:start position:0%
Rush shall not be a reason for
inspection

00:28:13.149 --> 00:28:13.159 align:start position:0%
inspection
 
00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:16.840 align:start position:0%
so extensive pitting you're right um
 
00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:26.120 align:start position:0%
and the the issue becomes um that would
 
00:28:28.909 --> 00:28:28.919 align:start position:0%
affect the proper brake operation again
 
00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
that's that's subjective as
 
00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:34.440 align:start position:0%
well so there is
 
00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:40.350 align:start position:0%
well so there is
not

00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:40.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:43.269 --> 00:28:43.279 align:start position:0%
um to describe it in
 
00:28:48.269 --> 00:28:48.279 align:start position:0%
writing um again would be hard to do and
 
00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:50.320 align:start position:0%
you're still relying on whoever is
 
00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
performing the inspection to make a
 
00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:53.880 align:start position:0%
judgment call as to whether or not it's
 
00:28:57.029 --> 00:28:57.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:57.039 --> 00:29:02.590 align:start position:0%
 
not

00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:02.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
so you know we I struggled with OS on
 
00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
that one line too whether or not the
 
00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:11.000 align:start position:0%
even word extensive needs to be there um
 
00:29:13.669 --> 00:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
I could live with it or without it so
 
00:29:15.669 --> 00:29:15.679 align:start position:0%
you know we can talk about that further
 
00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
I do see some other questions
 
00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:19.830 align:start position:0%
I do see some other questions
representative

00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:23.149 --> 00:29:23.159 align:start position:0%
D my concern is this is very
 
00:29:27.389 --> 00:29:27.399 align:start position:0%
subjective and if if I were a dealer I
 
00:29:31.029 --> 00:29:31.039 align:start position:0%
would I would uh try to utilize the
 
00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:34.840 align:start position:0%
language to increase my business I can
 
00:29:37.389 --> 00:29:37.399 align:start position:0%
certainly assum that would happen it
 
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
could happen that's right and and I have
 
00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
a real concern with that so that the
 
00:29:45.389 --> 00:29:45.399 align:start position:0%
language is clear enough so that it's
 
00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
not subjective if you know what I'm
 
00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:50.600 align:start position:0%
saying somehow that's what we're seeking
 
00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
to do but okay but again when you're
 
00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:54.640 align:start position:0%
looking at automotive parts and uh how
 
00:29:56.909 --> 00:29:56.919 align:start position:0%
many inspection stations do we have
 
00:29:58.710 --> 00:29:58.720 align:start position:0%
that's the challenge we have
 
00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:01.000 align:start position:0%
uh I see and I apologize I sorry hand up
 
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.389 align:start position:0%
uh I see and I apologize I sorry hand up
representa

00:30:02.389 --> 00:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
representa
 
00:30:05.549 --> 00:30:05.559 align:start position:0%
pondon thank you Mr chair um on the
 
00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:09.480 align:start position:0%
crack lens issue uh my concern is
 
00:30:12.509 --> 00:30:12.519 align:start position:0%
nowadays we've got the LED bulbs and any
 
00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
crack particularly particularly on brake
 
00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
lights can be blinding to the vehicles
 
00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
behind and most of these lenses also
 
00:30:25.269 --> 00:30:25.279 align:start position:0%
have their the rear uh backup lights um
 
00:30:28.389 --> 00:30:28.399 align:start position:0%
and furthermore where you can
 
00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
inexpensively buy a specific lens tape
 
00:30:36.509 --> 00:30:36.519 align:start position:0%
to cover the crack thus covering the the
 
00:30:40.149 --> 00:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
the blinding uh especially LED light
 
00:30:40.159 --> 00:30:41.029 align:start position:0%
the blinding uh especially LED light
bulb

00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:41.039 align:start position:0%
bulb
 
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
issues I I just don't support this part
 
00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:46.440 align:start position:0%
of the legislation and if I could do you
 
00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:49.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chair ask the uh the sergeant uh his
 
00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
viewpoint on uh that lens tape repair so
 
00:30:56.149 --> 00:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
you don't have to replace the whole
 
00:30:58.950 --> 00:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
assembly I shall I don't know where tail
 
00:31:00.509 --> 00:31:00.519 align:start position:0%
lights are even mentioned here but I
 
00:31:03.029 --> 00:31:03.039 align:start position:0%
might be wrong this deals with headlamps
 
00:31:06.269 --> 00:31:06.279 align:start position:0%
yes and as far as I know even tape on a
 
00:31:09.029 --> 00:31:09.039 align:start position:0%
headlamp is not currently legal but I'll
 
00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
I'll let safety respond to
 
00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
that so to answer your question
 
00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:21.269 align:start position:0%
that so to answer your question
um

00:31:21.269 --> 00:31:21.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:24.200 align:start position:0%
I looking at page
 
00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:34.029 --> 00:31:34.039 align:start position:0%
reflectors it talks about uh crack shall
 
00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
not cause inspection
 
00:31:39.269 --> 00:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
failure and if I'm correct so you're
 
00:31:41.029 --> 00:31:41.039 align:start position:0%
referring specifically to brake lights
 
00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:44.600 align:start position:0%
or tail lights right if I could line six
 
00:31:47.269 --> 00:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
either part of tail lamps or or
 
00:31:50.629 --> 00:31:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:50.639 --> 00:31:55.190 align:start position:0%
 
reflectors

00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:57.909 --> 00:31:57.919 align:start position:0%
okay so you are correct they they do
 
00:32:01.029 --> 00:32:01.039 align:start position:0%
make tape to to cover these things and
 
00:32:04.389 --> 00:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge of the um 3200
 
00:32:04.399 --> 00:32:05.669 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge of the um 3200
administrative

00:32:05.669 --> 00:32:05.679 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
00:32:08.389 --> 00:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
rules that deal with um vehicle
 
00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
inspection I don't recall seeing a
 
00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:14.200 align:start position:0%
Prohibition on putting tape on a tail
 
00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:16.269 align:start position:0%
Prohibition on putting tape on a tail
lenss

00:32:16.269 --> 00:32:16.279 align:start position:0%
lenss
 
00:32:18.509 --> 00:32:18.519 align:start position:0%
I I I I don't think I've ever looked
 
00:32:20.389 --> 00:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
specifically for that but I don't I
 
00:32:21.789 --> 00:32:21.799 align:start position:0%
don't remember seeing a Prohibition
 
00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:25.320 align:start position:0%
against it thank you and again Mr CH
 
00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:26.840 align:start position:0%
that's my point I think it's an inex
 
00:32:29.549 --> 00:32:29.559 align:start position:0%
inexpensive solution
 
00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
to uh dare I call it a blinding problem
 
00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of these LED lights are extremely
 
00:32:39.669 --> 00:32:39.679 align:start position:0%
bright a crack or especially a hole and
 
00:32:41.789 --> 00:32:41.799 align:start position:0%
this tape you can get at any automotive
 
00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
repair or Walmart whatever and it's
 
00:32:48.029 --> 00:32:48.039 align:start position:0%
specifically for lenses thank you Mr
 
00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:50.440 align:start position:0%
chair yeah well to as a solution would
 
00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:52.440 align:start position:0%
you be okay adding language to make sure
 
00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
that the tape is applied to the rear
 
00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
lights or anything red in the rear on
 
00:32:59.750 --> 00:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
only because all it says is that a
 
00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:02.120 align:start position:0%
cracked one won't be caused for
 
00:33:05.629 --> 00:33:05.639 align:start position:0%
inspection so for failure of inspection
 
00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
so if we can agree on that knowing that
 
00:33:11.669 --> 00:33:11.679 align:start position:0%
the tape is allowed we could mention
 
00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
that it would need to be used uh that's
 
00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:16.720 align:start position:0%
that's an option okay something to think
 
00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
about for a
 
00:33:20.110 --> 00:33:20.120 align:start position:0%
minute don't we love work sessions
 
00:33:23.230 --> 00:33:23.240 align:start position:0%
representative Fox thank you Mr chair
 
00:33:26.350 --> 00:33:26.360 align:start position:0%
and um I specifically from personal
 
00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
experience would prefer the language for
 
00:33:34.549 --> 00:33:34.559 align:start position:0%
the tape to be included um uh a a
 
00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
failure in $700 later um and we had the
 
00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
tape and and it was it was uh our
 
00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
inspection was denied um another may I
 
00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
ask another question Mr
 
00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:50.600 align:start position:0%
chair um considering the cracks and and
 
00:33:55.909 --> 00:33:55.919 align:start position:0%
the um the possibility of the
 
00:33:58.710 --> 00:33:58.720 align:start position:0%
projection and knowing that
 
00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
subjected the way it's worded in the the
 
00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:04.840 align:start position:0%
language here um what about the
 
00:34:08.629 --> 00:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
projection of a tail light with a
 
00:34:11.950 --> 00:34:11.960 align:start position:0%
crack does it diminish either does it
 
00:34:15.389 --> 00:34:15.399 align:start position:0%
diminish the um the
 
00:34:18.069 --> 00:34:18.079 align:start position:0%
lightness in the headlight or the tail
 
00:34:21.149 --> 00:34:21.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
question trying to be
 
00:34:31.109 --> 00:34:31.119 align:start position:0%
allinclusive um I think would be very
 
00:34:34.669 --> 00:34:34.679 align:start position:0%
hard uh a minor crack that's an inch or
 
00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
less um probably wouldn't cause any
 
00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:40.280 align:start position:0%
problem whatsoever I'm and I'm just
 
00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:42.560 align:start position:0%
speculating um knowing what I know about
 
00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:45.560 align:start position:0%
headlights and tail lights however
 
00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:48.760 align:start position:0%
depending on where it actually is either
 
00:34:52.069 --> 00:34:52.079 align:start position:0%
in the head lamp or in the tail lamp uh
 
00:34:52.079 --> 00:34:53.950 align:start position:0%
in the head lamp or in the tail lamp uh
could

00:34:53.950 --> 00:34:53.960 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:57.720 align:start position:0%
um cause the alteration of the project
 
00:34:59.550 --> 00:34:59.560 align:start position:0%
ction of the light as far as a tail
 
00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
light goes or a stop
 
00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:05.800 align:start position:0%
lamp I obviously I've seen cracks in
 
00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:10.040 align:start position:0%
them or actually holes in them and they
 
00:35:12.790 --> 00:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
emit a little more white light than they
 
00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
would if they were whole but I don't
 
00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
think on a tail light anyways having a
 
00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
crack on it diminishes the the amount of
 
00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:23.200 align:start position:0%
light that comes out of it um as far as
 
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
the headlight goes and again um H having
 
00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:30.280 align:start position:0%
read this again there are
 
00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:32.750 align:start position:0%
read this again there are
still

00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
still
 
00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
um it's still
 
00:35:40.109 --> 00:35:40.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
that somebody's going to have to make
 
00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:46.240 align:start position:0%
the determination whether it um affects
 
00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
the ability to perform as it was
 
00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:53.480 align:start position:0%
designed to that that's where
 
00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
um somebody's going to have to make that
 
00:35:56.640 --> 00:36:00.309 align:start position:0%
um somebody's going to have to make that
determination

00:36:00.309 --> 00:36:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:02.589 --> 00:36:02.599 align:start position:0%
I thank you for the answer on the tail
 
00:36:04.349 --> 00:36:04.359 align:start position:0%
lights are are you good with that on
 
00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
that back to the headlights though
 
00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:10.200 align:start position:0%
um what if we were to spell out the
 
00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:12.760 align:start position:0%
difference between a sealed beam which I
 
00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:14.680 align:start position:0%
believe the glass actually does have
 
00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
something to do with the trajectory as
 
00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:19.960 align:start position:0%
opposed to one of it's just a a plastic
 
00:36:21.790 --> 00:36:21.800 align:start position:0%
cover now because most of the the
 
00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:24.760 align:start position:0%
trajectory is created by the reflection
 
00:36:27.069 --> 00:36:27.079 align:start position:0%
tub in the back of the light yes sir
 
00:36:29.109 --> 00:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
that is correct and that's actually a
 
00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:33.200 align:start position:0%
great uh way to to try to clarify this
 
00:36:35.150 --> 00:36:35.160 align:start position:0%
even more correct sealed beam if a
 
00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
sealed beam is cracked it's going to
 
00:36:39.309 --> 00:36:39.319 align:start position:0%
fail right uh that's that's that's a
 
00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
given that a matter of time so that
 
00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:44.920 align:start position:0%
would be one distinction that you would
 
00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
that you could make is that you know any
 
00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
crack in a sealed beam would be you know
 
00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
reason for
 
00:36:55.630 --> 00:36:55.640 align:start position:0%
failure because obviously eventually it
 
00:36:59.030 --> 00:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
would fail and as far as
 
00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:01.480 align:start position:0%
a either
 
00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:03.480 align:start position:0%
projection I guess the best term would
 
00:37:04.829 --> 00:37:04.839 align:start position:0%
be projection headlight because that
 
00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:08.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be inclusive of incandescent
 
00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
hallogen and
 
00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
led um the projection uh style headlight
 
00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
any crack in the
 
00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:19.870 align:start position:0%
any crack in the
reflective

00:37:19.870 --> 00:37:19.880 align:start position:0%
reflective
 
00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
um part which is typically behind the
 
00:37:29.069 --> 00:37:29.079 align:start position:0%
bulb that would probably be a lot more
 
00:37:33.069 --> 00:37:33.079 align:start position:0%
specific as far as a crack on the lens
 
00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:35.200 align:start position:0%
in front of the
 
00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
bulb as long as it
 
00:37:42.589 --> 00:37:42.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
in and again affect the projection of it
 
00:37:47.829 --> 00:37:47.839 align:start position:0%
that that would be fine but I I'd still
 
00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:51.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
with inhibiting the ability to project
 
00:37:58.069 --> 00:37:58.079 align:start position:0%
light as prescribed you know by this
 
00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:00.520 align:start position:0%
which typically would mean by the by the
 
00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:02.960 align:start position:0%
manufacturer so you can do away with one
 
00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
part of it with the um sealed beam but
 
00:38:14.309 --> 00:38:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
as I think you would have
 
00:38:20.069 --> 00:38:20.079 align:start position:0%
to the projection style lights again I'm
 
00:38:21.550 --> 00:38:21.560 align:start position:0%
just thinking out loud here I would
 
00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
think you would have to say that cracks
 
00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
that don't allow moisture to enter would
 
00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
not cause uh failure of inspection if
 
00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:35.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
properly there you
 
00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:43.480 align:start position:0%
go so yes I think that probably would
 
00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:52.390 align:start position:0%
 
better

00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
better
 
00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:55.400 align:start position:0%
I yeah I saw somebody over here was that
 
00:38:58.550 --> 00:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
you represent rbo yes I this maybe this
 
00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:00.520 align:start position:0%
last line of discussion May supersede
 
00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
this but I guess in line 26 where we
 
00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
have that you know that new talized
 
00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:06.640 align:start position:0%
language that inhibit the ability for
 
00:39:08.589 --> 00:39:08.599 align:start position:0%
light to project as described in this
 
00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:10.160 align:start position:0%
section it's not in the next sentence
 
00:39:12.430 --> 00:39:12.440 align:start position:0%
and I was thinking ini if we add so say
 
00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:14.680 align:start position:0%
cracks and a headlamp tail light
 
00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:16.640 align:start position:0%
reflecting surface that inhibit the
 
00:39:18.349 --> 00:39:18.359 align:start position:0%
ability etc etc shall not cause
 
00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
inspection failure it sounds like
 
00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:21.400 align:start position:0%
Sergeant saying that's still too vague
 
00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
based on you know what the manufacturer
 
00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:25.720 align:start position:0%
expectations would be I my My overall
 
00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
concern is now in trying get everything
 
00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:29.560 align:start position:0%
you know we're trying to not be too big
 
00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:30.920 align:start position:0%
and now we're trying to get everything
 
00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:32.440 align:start position:0%
in there and I it seems really
 
00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
challenging and I you know I think we
 
00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
can just keep going that's that's my
 
00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:41.200 align:start position:0%
concern um and I and I want to have a
 
00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:42.800 align:start position:0%
better understanding why where the rules
 
00:39:44.349 --> 00:39:44.359 align:start position:0%
function I guess as opposed to the
 
00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
statute for for covering some of this or
 
00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:47.880 align:start position:0%
if there's if it all needs to be in
 
00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
statute or all should be in
 
00:39:54.069 --> 00:39:54.079 align:start position:0%
statute well we we we decided to do this
 
00:39:57.430 --> 00:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
with rust a few years ago because and
 
00:39:59.510 --> 00:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
there's no way for us who receive all
 
00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
the phone calls and complaints for us to
 
00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:04.160 align:start position:0%
really have a legitimate way to change
 
00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:06.720 align:start position:0%
the rules so when we identified things
 
00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:08.680 align:start position:0%
in rules that we just looked as too
 
00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
subjective that's when we started moving
 
00:40:13.109 --> 00:40:13.119 align:start position:0%
things into statute which supersede and
 
00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
that's all we're trying to do here is to
 
00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:16.640 align:start position:0%
continue the conversation that we've had
 
00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
for the last few years on trying to make
 
00:40:22.349 --> 00:40:22.359 align:start position:0%
people hate this program less and so I
 
00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:23.720 align:start position:0%
didn't never said it was going to be
 
00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:28.240 align:start position:0%
easy uh but um and and then we could
 
00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
certainly even do more uh but I think
 
00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:32.440 align:start position:0%
these are just ones that are really the
 
00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:34.040 align:start position:0%
ones people are complaining about the
 
00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
most especially when you start looking
 
00:40:38.069 --> 00:40:38.079 align:start position:0%
at the plastic lenses on the front of
 
00:40:39.950 --> 00:40:39.960 align:start position:0%
vehicles it can be hundreds and hundreds
 
00:40:41.870 --> 00:40:41.880 align:start position:0%
I mean I had a plastic lens on the front
 
00:40:43.950 --> 00:40:43.960 align:start position:0%
of my Dodge pickup on a fog light was
 
00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
$300 I mean it's it's crazy stuff and I
 
00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:48.920 align:start position:0%
don't need a fog light but the
 
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
inspection rule said if it came from the
 
00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:53.640 align:start position:0%
factory it's got to work so any these
 
00:40:55.430 --> 00:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
are the things that we're trying to look
 
00:40:57.910 --> 00:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
at representative Hill
 
00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
thank you um I'm looking at line two on
 
00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:03.960 align:start position:0%
page three and and it talks about
 
00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:07.480 align:start position:0%
projection um lower a minimum light
 
00:41:10.829 --> 00:41:10.839 align:start position:0%
output lower than the original equipment
 
00:41:13.069 --> 00:41:13.079 align:start position:0%
to me there is and maybe it's just my
 
00:41:17.150 --> 00:41:17.160 align:start position:0%
age but to me there is a huge range in
 
00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
the brightness of some some of this the
 
00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
light uh replacement socket than others
 
00:41:28.349 --> 00:41:28.359 align:start position:0%
uh or like whatever they call them um so
 
00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
it would seem to me I don't know how you
 
00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:34.680 align:start position:0%
ever say that it's lower or higher than
 
00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
and that's where the complaints for me
 
00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
come um people complaining that they
 
00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
can't see with oncoming traffic so
 
00:41:47.309 --> 00:41:47.319 align:start position:0%
rather than the amount of of um candle
 
00:41:49.710 --> 00:41:49.720 align:start position:0%
power that comes at me maybe that shows
 
00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
my age too I don't know um lumens I
 
00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
guess it is now right um but um it is uh
 
00:41:59.470 --> 00:41:59.480 align:start position:0%
it would seem to me that that's there's
 
00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
a there's a wide range we're trying to
 
00:42:04.990 --> 00:42:05.000 align:start position:0%
narrow down here that is almost
 
00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
impossible given The Replacements that
 
00:42:10.630 --> 00:42:10.640 align:start position:0%
are out there but if I can but the bill
 
00:42:12.109 --> 00:42:12.119 align:start position:0%
just talks about making sure it can't be
 
00:42:14.430 --> 00:42:14.440 align:start position:0%
lower than Vehicles original equipment I
 
00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:16.160 align:start position:0%
agree with you some of the aftermarket
 
00:42:18.109 --> 00:42:18.119 align:start position:0%
ones are too bright they're actually
 
00:42:20.589 --> 00:42:20.599 align:start position:0%
trying to be regulated currently even in
 
00:42:22.069 --> 00:42:22.079 align:start position:0%
another build that we have going before
 
00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:24.640 align:start position:0%
the Senate so okay and with the
 
00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
different colors too so I agree with you
 
00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:29.400 align:start position:0%
but this do just says it shouldn't be
 
00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
lower and I don't think that's a problem
 
00:42:35.950 --> 00:42:35.960 align:start position:0%
okay um and I'm sure everybody in the
 
00:42:37.549 --> 00:42:37.559 align:start position:0%
process has been making all kinds of
 
00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
copious notes so that when we're done
 
00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
with this it's going to be very quick
 
00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
for somebody to go over to ol and say we
 
00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:45.200 align:start position:0%
need to make a change here and a change
 
00:42:46.990 --> 00:42:47.000 align:start position:0%
here and a change there I'm sure this is
 
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:47.910 align:start position:0%
here and a change there I'm sure this is
being

00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:42:51.309 --> 00:42:51.319 align:start position:0%
done not by me representative
 
00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
c u this is u a question for the Sergent
 
00:42:58.790 --> 00:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
is uh I've seen a lot lot of cars uh
 
00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:02.480 align:start position:0%
that the headlights get hazy on the
 
00:43:06.910 --> 00:43:06.920 align:start position:0%
front and does anything in here allow
 
00:43:10.589 --> 00:43:10.599 align:start position:0%
for requiring uh that to be repaired I
 
00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
know you get polishing kits but seems
 
00:43:16.630 --> 00:43:16.640 align:start position:0%
like some of the U older Volvos were the
 
00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:18.640 align:start position:0%
worst on
 
00:43:23.790 --> 00:43:23.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:26.109 --> 00:43:26.119 align:start position:0%
two line
 
00:43:29.589 --> 00:43:29.599 align:start position:0%
24 and reading down from there says
 
00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:31.640 align:start position:0%
every this talks about reflector which
 
00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
is used as part of a headlight shall
 
00:43:35.710 --> 00:43:35.720 align:start position:0%
have reflecting surface approved by the
 
00:43:38.069 --> 00:43:38.079 align:start position:0%
director after satisfactory tests have
 
00:43:39.910 --> 00:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
been made and every reflecting surface
 
00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
shall be free of dents and other
 
00:43:43.750 --> 00:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
imperfections all that talks about the
 
00:43:47.150 --> 00:43:47.160 align:start position:0%
actual reflection reflective service but
 
00:43:50.069 --> 00:43:50.079 align:start position:0%
yes um as time goes on with a lot of
 
00:43:53.230 --> 00:43:53.240 align:start position:0%
these um lights that have a
 
00:43:55.950 --> 00:43:55.960 align:start position:0%
plastic cover or or the front of the
 
00:43:58.430 --> 00:43:58.440 align:start position:0%
light itself is PL plastic and it
 
00:44:01.069 --> 00:44:01.079 align:start position:0%
fades there is
 
00:44:01.079 --> 00:44:03.150 align:start position:0%
fades there is
nothing

00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:03.160 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
00:44:07.069 --> 00:44:07.079 align:start position:0%
currently in here that
 
00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
would that specifically talks
 
00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:19.390 align:start position:0%
 
condition

00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:19.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:23.190 --> 00:44:23.200 align:start position:0%
um yeah there is there is nothing in in
 
00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:26.440 align:start position:0%
here anyways that talks about that now
 
00:44:30.309 --> 00:44:30.319 align:start position:0%
you could I guess construe U
 
00:44:32.109 --> 00:44:32.119 align:start position:0%
that to
 
00:44:32.119 --> 00:44:34.270 align:start position:0%
that to
be

00:44:34.270 --> 00:44:34.280 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
defective um but again we get back to
 
00:44:38.309 --> 00:44:38.319 align:start position:0%
the sub
 
00:44:40.870 --> 00:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
subjectivity if that's the right word of
 
00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:42.520 align:start position:0%
all of us so somebody's going to have to
 
00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
make a a judgment call as to whether
 
00:44:48.549 --> 00:44:48.559 align:start position:0%
they feel it's prohibits the proper
 
00:44:50.109 --> 00:44:50.119 align:start position:0%
operation of it or
 
00:44:50.119 --> 00:44:52.030 align:start position:0%
operation of it or
not

00:44:52.030 --> 00:44:52.040 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:44:54.349 --> 00:44:54.359 align:start position:0%
followup yeah go ahead followup is there
 
00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
anything in current rules that would uh
 
00:44:59.109 --> 00:44:59.119 align:start position:0%
deal with that because this isn't this
 
00:45:01.870 --> 00:45:01.880 align:start position:0%
isn't a uh reflective surface the
 
00:45:04.030 --> 00:45:04.040 align:start position:0%
reflective surface is on the inside
 
00:45:07.349 --> 00:45:07.359 align:start position:0%
correct this is the protective outside
 
00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:10.440 align:start position:0%
surface but it also internally usually
 
00:45:14.510 --> 00:45:14.520 align:start position:0%
has some lens element molded into
 
00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:20.720 align:start position:0%
it so yeah the looking at this um on
 
00:45:22.510 --> 00:45:22.520 align:start position:0%
page two
 
00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:25.960 align:start position:0%
again it talks about a
 
00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:43.390 align:start position:0%
again it talks about a
motorcycle

00:45:43.390 --> 00:45:43.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:45.829 --> 00:45:45.839 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in here that speaks to
 
00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
that at all
 
00:45:52.150 --> 00:45:52.160 align:start position:0%
and to my knowledge of the 3200 rules
 
00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
which are the inspection rules
 
00:45:59.069 --> 00:45:59.079 align:start position:0%
um my recollection it just says it has
 
00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
to properly
 
00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:06.870 align:start position:0%
to properly
function

00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:09.549 --> 00:46:09.559 align:start position:0%
and having somebody make the the
 
00:46:11.230 --> 00:46:11.240 align:start position:0%
Judgment call that it was defective
 
00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
because it
 
00:46:15.630 --> 00:46:15.640 align:start position:0%
didn't allow enough light come out to
 
00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:20.240 align:start position:0%
come out would would be again subjective
 
00:46:21.630 --> 00:46:21.640 align:start position:0%
to the to the inspector that's
 
00:46:24.829 --> 00:46:24.839 align:start position:0%
performing the inspection so it's
 
00:46:26.589 --> 00:46:26.599 align:start position:0%
unfortunately as we get further and
 
00:46:28.630 --> 00:46:28.640 align:start position:0%
further along in a lot of the newer
 
00:46:30.109 --> 00:46:30.119 align:start position:0%
technology there's a lot of things that
 
00:46:32.549 --> 00:46:32.559 align:start position:0%
come up that are just not addressed and
 
00:46:34.750 --> 00:46:34.760 align:start position:0%
that would be one of
 
00:46:37.510 --> 00:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
them thank
 
00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
00:46:42.750 --> 00:46:42.760 align:start position:0%
SES thank you Mr chairman I I want to
 
00:46:46.069 --> 00:46:46.079 align:start position:0%
actually jump into a slightly different
 
00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:50.800 align:start position:0%
question so the language about um
 
00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:53.200 align:start position:0%
vehicle shall not fail inspection if the
 
00:46:56.109 --> 00:46:56.119 align:start position:0%
windows won't open begs the question for
 
00:46:56.119 --> 00:46:59.069 align:start position:0%
windows won't open begs the question for
me

00:46:59.069 --> 00:46:59.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:01.950 --> 00:47:01.960 align:start position:0%
of if there were some type of event
 
00:47:07.309 --> 00:47:07.319 align:start position:0%
whether it be an accident or uh ending
 
00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
up on its side so the doors didn't work
 
00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm just I am a little concerned
 
00:47:17.470 --> 00:47:17.480 align:start position:0%
about rescue possibilities if the
 
00:47:21.190 --> 00:47:21.200 align:start position:0%
windows don't work and I understand that
 
00:47:23.950 --> 00:47:23.960 align:start position:0%
initially obviously when police or fire
 
00:47:26.069 --> 00:47:26.079 align:start position:0%
arrive they have ways to get the windows
 
00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:29.160 align:start position:0%
open you using certain tools but what
 
00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
about the person in the car who needs to
 
00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
get out and I'm I'm just I I wondered if
 
00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
you had an opinion about that or and I
 
00:47:38.910 --> 00:47:38.920 align:start position:0%
and I would ask my colleagues to think
 
00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
about that
 
00:47:43.390 --> 00:47:43.400 align:start position:0%
too thank you for the questions sir yes
 
00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
I I actually was quite surprised to see
 
00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
that in here um as a first responder I I
 
00:47:53.549 --> 00:47:53.559 align:start position:0%
do have a a big issue with that
 
00:47:57.270 --> 00:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
um I don't know of any specific event in
 
00:48:00.190 --> 00:48:00.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um there was one recently
 
00:48:02.309 --> 00:48:02.319 align:start position:0%
with a Tesla that went into the water
 
00:48:03.390 --> 00:48:03.400 align:start position:0%
that ended
 
00:48:06.750 --> 00:48:06.760 align:start position:0%
up um the driver not surviving someplace
 
00:48:08.510 --> 00:48:08.520 align:start position:0%
out on the west coast because I couldn't
 
00:48:11.349 --> 00:48:11.359 align:start position:0%
get a window down
 
00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:14.240 align:start position:0%
um I don't know the exact circumstance
 
00:48:16.910 --> 00:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
but that was within the last month so as
 
00:48:18.829 --> 00:48:18.839 align:start position:0%
far as a first respond goes yeah that
 
00:48:22.829 --> 00:48:22.839 align:start position:0%
that's a that's an issue that I I think
 
00:48:26.069 --> 00:48:26.079 align:start position:0%
in my opinion as you asked that's that's
 
00:48:27.790 --> 00:48:27.800 align:start position:0%
not a that's not something that I would
 
00:48:29.390 --> 00:48:29.400 align:start position:0%
be in favor
 
00:48:32.309 --> 00:48:32.319 align:start position:0%
of well from from from what if I can
 
00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:34.760 align:start position:0%
reply to that for the electric vehicles
 
00:48:36.069 --> 00:48:36.079 align:start position:0%
that's a problem that's been part of the
 
00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:38.240 align:start position:0%
conversation is that when the 12vt
 
00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
system shuts down as part of an issue
 
00:48:43.390 --> 00:48:43.400 align:start position:0%
with the main batteries that none of the
 
00:48:46.190 --> 00:48:46.200 align:start position:0%
windows work corre so that's by Design
 
00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
that's by manufacturer um that's that
 
00:48:50.549 --> 00:48:50.559 align:start position:0%
particular thing is a problem that we
 
00:48:52.829 --> 00:48:52.839 align:start position:0%
should be talking to them about yeah um
 
00:48:55.390 --> 00:48:55.400 align:start position:0%
but in terms of rules right now um I do
 
00:48:57.109 --> 00:48:57.119 align:start position:0%
understand what the First Responders am
 
00:48:59.109 --> 00:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
I correct in saying that if a window
 
00:49:02.430 --> 00:49:02.440 align:start position:0%
won't go up you can get a sticker but if
 
00:49:04.589 --> 00:49:04.599 align:start position:0%
it won't go down you
 
00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
can't that's currently currently yes I
 
00:49:12.109 --> 00:49:12.119 align:start position:0%
think it again thinking back on the 3200
 
00:49:14.750 --> 00:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
rules I think it says it has to properly
 
00:49:17.789 --> 00:49:17.799 align:start position:0%
function I don't think it spells out one
 
00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
way or the other I think it just says it
 
00:49:22.109 --> 00:49:22.119 align:start position:0%
has to properly function okay thank you
 
00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
anybody else representative Sellers and
 
00:49:24.910 --> 00:49:24.920 align:start position:0%
we're only going to do this for a little
 
00:49:26.430 --> 00:49:26.440 align:start position:0%
bit longer then we're going to make a
 
00:49:27.710 --> 00:49:27.720 align:start position:0%
decision decision what we want to do
 
00:49:30.430 --> 00:49:30.440 align:start position:0%
with this bill as a whole um whether
 
00:49:32.349 --> 00:49:32.359 align:start position:0%
we're going to continue to amend or if
 
00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a different love the
 
00:49:36.870 --> 00:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
transportation metaphors a different
 
00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:38.240 align:start position:0%
route to
 
00:49:41.950 --> 00:49:41.960 align:start position:0%
take representa sers thank you Mr thank
 
00:49:46.069 --> 00:49:46.079 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um a few things uh going
 
00:49:50.510 --> 00:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
back to page three for a second on lines
 
00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
uh I guess what is it
 
00:49:56.430 --> 00:49:56.440 align:start position:0%
34 where it said extensive didn't that
 
00:49:58.829 --> 00:49:58.839 align:start position:0%
come lot of rules didn't rules have that
 
00:50:01.510 --> 00:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
in there or is that something that maybe
 
00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
you uh created on that one issue I'm
 
00:50:06.829 --> 00:50:06.839 align:start position:0%
just trying to understand because a lot
 
00:50:08.109 --> 00:50:08.119 align:start position:0%
of this stuff for the breaks I thought
 
00:50:11.230 --> 00:50:11.240 align:start position:0%
came out of rules and or most all of
 
00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
it I don't believe that word came out of
 
00:50:17.630 --> 00:50:17.640 align:start position:0%
rules because the rules actually
 
00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:20.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned rust as well any rust and it
 
00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
didn't say how much I mean it could have
 
00:50:24.589 --> 00:50:24.599 align:start position:0%
been a orange Sheen and somebody could
 
00:50:25.630 --> 00:50:25.640 align:start position:0%
have failed
 
00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:27.150 align:start position:0%
have failed
it

00:50:27.150 --> 00:50:27.160 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:50:28.750 --> 00:50:28.760 align:start position:0%
which is what started us on this
 
00:50:30.309 --> 00:50:30.319 align:start position:0%
conversation to begin with that's just
 
00:50:34.349 --> 00:50:34.359 align:start position:0%
not fair or right thank you the my
 
00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
my I'm sorry one other question go ahead
 
00:50:40.750 --> 00:50:40.760 align:start position:0%
follow thanks um I'm just
 
00:50:43.870 --> 00:50:43.880 align:start position:0%
saying a lot of the stuff is is is Right
 
00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
some of it's definitely sub subjective
 
00:50:50.109 --> 00:50:50.119 align:start position:0%
but going back to the window pod itself
 
00:50:52.270 --> 00:50:52.280 align:start position:0%
and what what the chair said I mean your
 
00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
electric your Electric System it fails
 
00:50:56.870 --> 00:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
everybody has electric windows this day
 
00:51:00.789 --> 00:51:00.799 align:start position:0%
so if they fail I mean um you go in
 
00:51:02.670 --> 00:51:02.680 align:start position:0%
water the 12vt system fails the window
 
00:51:05.150 --> 00:51:05.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't go up or down anyway so to me
 
00:51:06.910 --> 00:51:06.920 align:start position:0%
that's just I don't know we're just
 
00:51:08.549 --> 00:51:08.559 align:start position:0%
trying to get the little Gat out of this
 
00:51:10.030 --> 00:51:10.040 align:start position:0%
bill and I'm saying we're trying to help
 
00:51:12.349 --> 00:51:12.359 align:start position:0%
the people that really need help because
 
00:51:15.589 --> 00:51:15.599 align:start position:0%
they can't afford a three or $400 head
 
00:51:18.750 --> 00:51:18.760 align:start position:0%
lamp or or $200 tail lamp because it's
 
00:51:21.870 --> 00:51:21.880 align:start position:0%
cracked yeah it might diffuse the the uh
 
00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:23.640 align:start position:0%
the beam a little bit but I don't know
 
00:51:25.829 --> 00:51:25.839 align:start position:0%
how many times that actually happens and
 
00:51:28.109 --> 00:51:28.119 align:start position:0%
unless we have a out and and we know
 
00:51:31.349 --> 00:51:31.359 align:start position:0%
that hey this is a problem then I think
 
00:51:32.549 --> 00:51:32.559 align:start position:0%
we should at least try to help the
 
00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:35.200 align:start position:0%
people some uh it no bill is not going
 
00:51:37.870 --> 00:51:37.880 align:start position:0%
to be 100% right no matter what we do
 
00:51:40.990 --> 00:51:41.000 align:start position:0%
unless we list every single thing on
 
00:51:43.470 --> 00:51:43.480 align:start position:0%
there so I'm just very concerned to me
 
00:51:45.230 --> 00:51:45.240 align:start position:0%
it's starting to get uh overwhelming
 
00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
with maybe all the changes that are
 
00:51:48.750 --> 00:51:48.760 align:start position:0%
going to need to be done and we're going
 
00:51:50.990 --> 00:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
to end up throwing a a bill that might
 
00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
be helpful just throwing the whole thing
 
00:51:56.950 --> 00:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
away thank you sir I sawar down here
 
00:51:59.750 --> 00:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
representative belber welcome welome to
 
00:52:01.309 --> 00:52:01.319 align:start position:0%
Transportation thank you it's a pleasure
 
00:52:04.789 --> 00:52:04.799 align:start position:0%
to be here I'm always happy to learn um
 
00:52:06.990 --> 00:52:07.000 align:start position:0%
I grew up in Manhattan and my parents
 
00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
were very strict about when you're
 
00:52:11.349 --> 00:52:11.359 align:start position:0%
driving you follow the rules so when I
 
00:52:14.549 --> 00:52:14.559 align:start position:0%
was a kid and we would pass a No Parking
 
00:52:17.069 --> 00:52:17.079 align:start position:0%
Zone and there was a car parked in it I
 
00:52:19.589 --> 00:52:19.599 align:start position:0%
would say to my father or my mom why is
 
00:52:22.230 --> 00:52:22.240 align:start position:0%
there a car there and my dad would half
 
00:52:24.630 --> 00:52:24.640 align:start position:0%
jokingly say because it doesn't say
 
00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:33.910 --> 00:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
at then so I'm wondering in uh on page
 
00:52:35.829 --> 00:52:35.839 align:start position:0%
two on line
 
00:52:39.069 --> 00:52:39.079 align:start position:0%
27 um cracks in a headlamp shall not
 
00:52:41.589 --> 00:52:41.599 align:start position:0%
cause inspection
 
00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
failure people I know will try to get
 
00:52:46.910 --> 00:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
away with things if they
 
00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
can and even though it is repetitive I
 
00:52:54.349 --> 00:52:54.359 align:start position:0%
wonder if adding there and then again on
 
00:52:58.510 --> 00:52:58.520 align:start position:0%
uh line eight on page three repeating
 
00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
what it says just before that along the
 
00:53:02.910 --> 00:53:02.920 align:start position:0%
lines of shall not cause inspection
 
00:53:06.150 --> 00:53:06.160 align:start position:0%
failure unless they inhibit the ability
 
00:53:08.710 --> 00:53:08.720 align:start position:0%
for the light to blah blah blah and just
 
00:53:11.109 --> 00:53:11.119 align:start position:0%
even though it's repetitive it's really
 
00:53:13.870 --> 00:53:13.880 align:start position:0%
clear so if you go to get your car
 
00:53:15.309 --> 00:53:15.319 align:start position:0%
inspected and there's a crack and you
 
00:53:18.270 --> 00:53:18.280 align:start position:0%
get a failure notice somebody say but it
 
00:53:21.789 --> 00:53:21.799 align:start position:0%
says it doesn't matter say yeah except
 
00:53:26.789 --> 00:53:26.799 align:start position:0%
it inhibits the ability for you to uh to
 
00:53:29.349 --> 00:53:29.359 align:start position:0%
get proper light coming out of your car
 
00:53:33.549 --> 00:53:33.559 align:start position:0%
and then if I may uh a question for you
 
00:53:37.549 --> 00:53:37.559 align:start position:0%
is there any a manual whether paper or
 
00:53:40.030 --> 00:53:40.040 align:start position:0%
electronic that's sent to inspection
 
00:53:43.030 --> 00:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
stations so that
 
00:53:47.829 --> 00:53:47.839 align:start position:0%
they see what the difference between a
 
00:53:51.630 --> 00:53:51.640 align:start position:0%
well this really is okay and that really
 
00:53:53.990 --> 00:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
isn't so to answer your question thank
 
00:53:56.950 --> 00:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
you for the question um no
 
00:53:59.789 --> 00:53:59.799 align:start position:0%
there is no guidance given it's
 
00:54:01.910 --> 00:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
basically just whatever is in rule or
 
00:54:06.670 --> 00:54:06.680 align:start position:0%
law and again it becomes very subjective
 
00:54:09.750 --> 00:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
um you that's one thing you can't teach
 
00:54:12.549 --> 00:54:12.559 align:start position:0%
is I guess by experience somebody can
 
00:54:15.230 --> 00:54:15.240 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not something would
 
00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
interfere but without uh having
 
00:54:21.190 --> 00:54:21.200 align:start position:0%
something specifically written or
 
00:54:24.750 --> 00:54:24.760 align:start position:0%
pictures which are not included in that
 
00:54:27.349 --> 00:54:27.359 align:start position:0%
um no
 
00:54:30.069 --> 00:54:30.079 align:start position:0%
so the anybody that does inspections in
 
00:54:33.430 --> 00:54:33.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has the in-host machine um
 
00:54:36.109 --> 00:54:36.119 align:start position:0%
other than a a fleet inspection
 
00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:38.640 align:start position:0%
sometimes um it has all of this
 
00:54:40.789 --> 00:54:40.799 align:start position:0%
information in it but it doesn't have
 
00:54:43.190 --> 00:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
pictures that go along with it
 
00:54:46.109 --> 00:54:46.119 align:start position:0%
no I I just wonder if was there follow
 
00:54:50.270 --> 00:54:50.280 align:start position:0%
up I'm sorry yes I just wonder
 
00:54:53.150 --> 00:54:53.160 align:start position:0%
if in some if the directionals don't
 
00:54:54.710 --> 00:54:54.720 align:start position:0%
work they don't work they they don't
 
00:54:57.309 --> 00:54:57.319 align:start position:0%
sort of work correct either they do or
 
00:54:59.710 --> 00:54:59.720 align:start position:0%
they don't but for something where there
 
00:55:03.390 --> 00:55:03.400 align:start position:0%
is subjectiveness involved I wonder if
 
00:55:05.950 --> 00:55:05.960 align:start position:0%
it might be worth posting on a the
 
00:55:08.589 --> 00:55:08.599 align:start position:0%
website or something like that this is
 
00:55:12.109 --> 00:55:12.119 align:start position:0%
what we mean by this is rust and this is
 
00:55:16.549 --> 00:55:16.559 align:start position:0%
pitting or the equivalent thank you Mr
 
00:55:19.630 --> 00:55:19.640 align:start position:0%
chair very good point thank you yeah
 
00:55:22.990 --> 00:55:23.000 align:start position:0%
that's a another challenge that we have
 
00:55:24.750 --> 00:55:24.760 align:start position:0%
because we contract to a company called
 
00:55:27.270 --> 00:55:27.280 align:start position:0%
Gordon Derby so any decisions to either
 
00:55:29.549 --> 00:55:29.559 align:start position:0%
we make or come out of Jael car then
 
00:55:31.150 --> 00:55:31.160 align:start position:0%
have to get transmitted to the company
 
00:55:32.670 --> 00:55:32.680 align:start position:0%
that actually runs the machines and it's
 
00:55:34.309 --> 00:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
got to get on their software which can
 
00:55:35.950 --> 00:55:35.960 align:start position:0%
get get transmitt it to all the
 
00:55:37.990 --> 00:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
inspection stations that's that's a
 
00:55:40.589 --> 00:55:40.599 align:start position:0%
whole another conversation but last
 
00:55:42.829 --> 00:55:42.839 align:start position:0%
question in terms of well I see I'm GNA
 
00:55:45.109 --> 00:55:45.119 align:start position:0%
have to give I'm gonna have to give one
 
00:55:47.829 --> 00:55:47.839 align:start position:0%
shot for those that haven't on
 
00:55:50.670 --> 00:55:50.680 align:start position:0%
dissecting this any further
 
00:55:53.069 --> 00:55:53.079 align:start position:0%
repres thank you Mr chairman uh thank
 
00:55:55.589 --> 00:55:55.599 align:start position:0%
you Steph s taking my question in terms
 
00:55:57.470 --> 00:55:57.480 align:start position:0%
of the cracked
 
00:55:59.470 --> 00:55:59.480 align:start position:0%
headlights I know I'm going to show my
 
00:56:02.549 --> 00:56:02.559 align:start position:0%
age that many years ago when I used to
 
00:56:03.990 --> 00:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
get my car
 
00:56:07.510 --> 00:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
inspected um there used to be like
 
00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:10.160 align:start position:0%
something on the wall so that when they
 
00:56:13.109 --> 00:56:13.119 align:start position:0%
turned my headlights on the headlights
 
00:56:16.549 --> 00:56:16.559 align:start position:0%
had to hit a certain area you know on
 
00:56:21.390 --> 00:56:21.400 align:start position:0%
this wall area which allowed me to pass
 
00:56:25.230 --> 00:56:25.240 align:start position:0%
inspection with the cracked headlights
 
00:56:28.230 --> 00:56:28.240 align:start position:0%
um not being added in inspection station
 
00:56:31.430 --> 00:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
when they turn them on is there do they
 
00:56:34.309 --> 00:56:34.319 align:start position:0%
test it like that or do they just turn
 
00:56:36.190 --> 00:56:36.200 align:start position:0%
them on and just see
 
00:56:39.390 --> 00:56:39.400 align:start position:0%
that that they're working I mean is
 
00:56:41.470 --> 00:56:41.480 align:start position:0%
there a I guess what I'm asking is is
 
00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:42.670 align:start position:0%
there a I guess what I'm asking is is
there

00:56:42.670 --> 00:56:42.680 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:56:46.510 --> 00:56:46.520 align:start position:0%
a thing that they test to say yep it hit
 
00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:47.349 align:start position:0%
a thing that they test to say yep it hit
this

00:56:47.349 --> 00:56:47.359 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:56:51.270 --> 00:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
particular perimeter viewing for it to
 
00:56:54.109 --> 00:56:54.119 align:start position:0%
pass thank you for the question yes
 
00:56:56.750 --> 00:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
there is so uh yes
 
00:56:58.670 --> 00:56:58.680 align:start position:0%
um going back a number of years I won't
 
00:57:02.190 --> 00:57:02.200 align:start position:0%
say how many um we used the wall the
 
00:57:04.430 --> 00:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
thing on the wall yeah um nowadays we
 
00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
have this fancy little machine that
 
00:57:08.630 --> 00:57:08.640 align:start position:0%
rolls up right up against the headlight
 
00:57:11.109 --> 00:57:11.119 align:start position:0%
it's a headlight aimer that every
 
00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
inspection station in the Hamp is
 
00:57:16.029 --> 00:57:16.039 align:start position:0%
supposed to have and use um that
 
00:57:18.910 --> 00:57:18.920 align:start position:0%
determines whether or not it actually is
 
00:57:21.670 --> 00:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
aimed properly so yes uh to your
 
00:57:24.309 --> 00:57:24.319 align:start position:0%
question there are two ways the screen
 
00:57:25.870 --> 00:57:25.880 align:start position:0%
that's on the wall which requires a
 
00:57:28.750 --> 00:57:28.760 align:start position:0%
certain distance y um from the front of
 
00:57:32.109 --> 00:57:32.119 align:start position:0%
the vehicle to the wall or the headlight
 
00:57:34.029 --> 00:57:34.039 align:start position:0%
aimer machine that actually rolls right
 
00:57:37.950 --> 00:57:37.960 align:start position:0%
up against the the vehicle itself so yes
 
00:57:41.349 --> 00:57:41.359 align:start position:0%
those two methods um one or the other
 
00:57:45.190 --> 00:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
has to be used and yes um if for some
 
00:57:48.630 --> 00:57:48.640 align:start position:0%
reason the headlight was damaged and did
 
00:57:50.589 --> 00:57:50.599 align:start position:0%
not project properly it would show up
 
00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
when they tested it if that makes sense
 
00:57:57.029 --> 00:57:57.039 align:start position:0%
to you can follow follow
 
00:57:59.789 --> 00:57:59.799 align:start position:0%
so if you mentioned that when there's a
 
00:58:02.349 --> 00:58:02.359 align:start position:0%
crack on the sides the the light can be
 
00:58:04.589 --> 00:58:04.599 align:start position:0%
distorted a little bit so in this in
 
00:58:07.870 --> 00:58:07.880 align:start position:0%
these tests would it pick that up that
 
00:58:10.829 --> 00:58:10.839 align:start position:0%
it gets distorted
 
00:58:13.510 --> 00:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
incorrectly it would it would pick it up
 
00:58:17.349 --> 00:58:17.359 align:start position:0%
if it affected the actual projection of
 
00:58:19.910 --> 00:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
it so it wasn't projected properly yes
 
00:58:22.430 --> 00:58:22.440 align:start position:0%
but as far as light for the lack of
 
00:58:24.270 --> 00:58:24.280 align:start position:0%
better term escaping someplace else it
 
00:58:27.990 --> 00:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
would not thank you
 
00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:30.190 align:start position:0%
would not thank you
representative

00:58:30.190 --> 00:58:30.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:58:33.190 --> 00:58:33.200 align:start position:0%
Jones Thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:58:36.109 --> 00:58:36.119 align:start position:0%
step for being here
 
00:58:38.510 --> 00:58:38.520 align:start position:0%
um mine's an easy question I just want
 
00:58:41.910 --> 00:58:41.920 align:start position:0%
to ask if the two sections on uh in one
 
00:58:44.029 --> 00:58:44.039 align:start position:0%
on page two one on page three one about
 
00:58:46.309 --> 00:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
head head lamps and tail lamps we were
 
00:58:50.670 --> 00:58:50.680 align:start position:0%
talking about tape which isn't in there
 
00:58:53.390 --> 00:58:53.400 align:start position:0%
but the word tape is very generalized
 
00:58:56.069 --> 00:58:56.079 align:start position:0%
should it be if we do put tape in there
 
00:58:58.109 --> 00:58:58.119 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be like color matching
 
00:59:00.990 --> 00:59:01.000 align:start position:0%
translucent tape we don't want duct tape
 
00:59:03.430 --> 00:59:03.440 align:start position:0%
over a a
 
00:59:05.829 --> 00:59:05.839 align:start position:0%
lens thank you for the question that's
 
00:59:07.950 --> 00:59:07.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct sir that would be the
 
00:59:09.630 --> 00:59:09.640 align:start position:0%
language that the suggested language
 
00:59:11.190 --> 00:59:11.200 align:start position:0%
that would be in there so it would
 
00:59:12.950 --> 00:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
clarify correct you can't put black
 
00:59:19.069 --> 00:59:19.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:24.190 --> 00:59:24.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:27.750 --> 00:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
fun some things never SE to amaz all
 
00:59:30.910 --> 00:59:30.920 align:start position:0%
right um I'm not even sure how to do
 
00:59:34.270 --> 00:59:34.280 align:start position:0%
this yeah
 
00:59:37.029 --> 00:59:37.039 align:start position:0%
absolutely do we want to attempt well
 
00:59:38.710 --> 00:59:38.720 align:start position:0%
first of all I think everybody in the
 
00:59:41.710 --> 00:59:41.720 align:start position:0%
room wants to do
 
00:59:44.230 --> 00:59:44.240 align:start position:0%
something so the next question would be
 
00:59:45.670 --> 00:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
because we have options on how this
 
00:59:48.510 --> 00:59:48.520 align:start position:0%
plans out today we could
 
00:59:50.589 --> 00:59:50.599 align:start position:0%
theoretically take the some of the
 
00:59:52.510 --> 00:59:52.520 align:start position:0%
highlighted issues that we had today and
 
00:59:55.150 --> 00:59:55.160 align:start position:0%
get it re amended we have all day I can
 
00:59:57.349 --> 00:59:57.359 align:start position:0%
recess our EX excutive session and take
 
00:59:59.990 --> 01:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
it up even after our public hearings
 
01:00:03.029 --> 01:00:03.039 align:start position:0%
this afternoon if we want to do
 
01:00:07.230 --> 01:00:07.240 align:start position:0%
something um we could pass it the way it
 
01:00:10.910 --> 01:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
is or we could itl
 
01:00:16.069 --> 01:00:16.079 align:start position:0%
it um end of the day this is kind of
 
01:00:18.589 --> 01:00:18.599 align:start position:0%
frustrating only because if I'm a firm
 
01:00:20.549 --> 01:00:20.559 align:start position:0%
believer if we don't do something in
 
01:00:22.789 --> 01:00:22.799 align:start position:0%
terms of people are not hating this as
 
01:00:25.029 --> 01:00:25.039 align:start position:0%
much as they do the solution that we're
 
01:00:26.309 --> 01:00:26.319 align:start position:0%
looking for is going to mean we don't
 
01:00:27.990 --> 01:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
have the program at all it's one of
 
01:00:30.670 --> 01:00:30.680 align:start position:0%
these days it's going to happen so I'll
 
01:00:33.349 --> 01:00:33.359 align:start position:0%
leave it at that um let me speak with
 
01:00:35.150 --> 01:00:35.160 align:start position:0%
the ranking member for a moment we'll
 
01:00:37.230 --> 01:00:37.240 align:start position:0%
probably go into a caucus to
 
01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:40.480 align:start position:0%
decide um to which which which direction
 
01:00:54.910 --> 01:00:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:54.920 --> 01:01:18.710 align:start position:0%
 
minute

01:01:18.710 --> 01:01:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:20.390 --> 01:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
okay so we are going to caucus can we
 
01:01:23.270 --> 01:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
meet in your office or is that a problem
 
01:01:24.630 --> 01:01:24.640 align:start position:0%
we are going to caucus so if I can have
 
01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
the Republican stay in this room

01:37:29.870 --> 01:37:29.880 align:start position:0%
19 oh 19 that's right no because no Ste
 
01:37:32.590 --> 01:37:32.600 align:start position:0%
19 to zero uh so our recommendation of
 
01:37:37.910 --> 01:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
interim study is adopted 19 to zero um
 
01:37:39.750 --> 01:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor did ask if we could
 
01:37:42.910 --> 01:37:42.920 align:start position:0%
put this on on regular calendar just so
 
01:37:44.310 --> 01:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
we could make State make a few
 
01:37:46.109 --> 01:37:46.119 align:start position:0%
statements about it I did let him know
 
01:37:48.270 --> 01:37:48.280 align:start position:0%
that it was um going to be interum
 
01:37:49.950 --> 01:37:49.960 align:start position:0%
studied and he said that's fine but if
 
01:37:51.270 --> 01:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
he just asked if we could leave it on
 
01:37:53.709 --> 01:37:53.719 align:start position:0%
the calendar so if that's okay with
 
01:37:55.669 --> 01:37:55.679 align:start position:0%
everybody we will do that saves him from
 
01:37:58.030 --> 01:37:58.040 align:start position:0%
pulling it uh so I'll close the
 
01:38:02.310 --> 01:38:02.320 align:start position:0%
executive session on House Bill
 
01:38:22.430 --> 01:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:33.070 align:start position:0%
 
please

01:38:33.070 --> 01:38:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:35.669 --> 01:38:35.679 align:start position:0%
okay well now I'm going to open up the
 
01:38:38.470 --> 01:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
executive session on House Bill
 
01:38:41.470 --> 01:38:41.480 align:start position:0%
1637 relative to reducing requirements
 
01:38:42.830 --> 01:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
for vehicle
 
01:38:46.310 --> 01:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
inspections uh in talks with uh all of
 
01:38:49.070 --> 01:38:49.080 align:start position:0%
my colleagues in the ranking member it
 
01:38:50.510 --> 01:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
does look like we might be able to come
 
01:38:52.550 --> 01:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
to some consensus with a few Corrections
 
01:38:55.189 --> 01:38:55.199 align:start position:0%
based on our work session this morning
 
01:38:58.030 --> 01:38:58.040 align:start position:0%
so to accomplish that I'm going to
 
01:39:02.189 --> 01:39:02.199 align:start position:0%
recess the executive session until after
 
01:39:05.550 --> 01:39:05.560 align:start position:0%
our public hearings this afternoon so as
 
01:39:07.550 --> 01:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
soon as our hearings are done uh we'll
 
01:39:09.669 --> 01:39:09.679 align:start position:0%
go back into executive session the
 
01:39:11.709 --> 01:39:11.719 align:start position:0%
changes are slight so I'm hopeful we'll
 
01:39:13.589 --> 01:39:13.599 align:start position:0%
be able to get the amendment back by
 
01:39:16.390 --> 01:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
from OS by then so again I'm going to
 
01:39:17.990 --> 01:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
recess the executive session on House
 
01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:22.350 align:start position:0%

towns um I'm honored to address you
 
03:06:15.070 --> 03:06:15.080 align:start position:0%
today in support of Senate Bill
 
03:06:18.910 --> 03:06:18.920 align:start position:0%
429 concerning Governor's coun plates
 
03:06:21.950 --> 03:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 429 would allow executive
 
03:06:24.510 --> 03:06:24.520 align:start position:0%
Council plates to be printed with blue
 
03:06:27.910 --> 03:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
numbers and letters on white background
 
03:06:30.670 --> 03:06:30.680 align:start position:0%
exclusively as it has been previously in
 
03:06:33.550 --> 03:06:33.560 align:start position:0%
the case for many many years however
 
03:06:35.830 --> 03:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
during the legislative plate production
 
03:06:38.990 --> 03:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
and issuance that occurred in 2023 the
 
03:06:41.710 --> 03:06:41.720 align:start position:0%
Division of Motor Vehicles followed the
 
03:06:44.510 --> 03:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
state law RSA
 
03:06:49.190 --> 03:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
261 semicolon 90 which requires all the
 
03:06:51.229 --> 03:06:51.239 align:start position:0%
legislative plates to be printed with
 
03:06:54.349 --> 03:06:54.359 align:start position:0%
green or red numbers and letters which
 
03:06:57.349 --> 03:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
should alternate every B anyia this bill
 
03:06:59.710 --> 03:06:59.720 align:start position:0%
seeks to bring consistency back to the
 
03:07:02.429 --> 03:07:02.439 align:start position:0%
issuance of the executive Council plates
 
03:07:04.190 --> 03:07:04.200 align:start position:0%
by allowing them to be printed
 
03:07:06.670 --> 03:07:06.680 align:start position:0%
exclusively with blue numbers and
 
03:07:09.070 --> 03:07:09.080 align:start position:0%
letters on a white background as has
 
03:07:11.790 --> 03:07:11.800 align:start position:0%
been the case for many years by aligning
 
03:07:14.950 --> 03:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
with historical practice Senate Bill 429
 
03:07:17.630 --> 03:07:17.640 align:start position:0%
ensures uniformity in the design of
 
03:07:19.710 --> 03:07:19.720 align:start position:0%
these plates and eliminates confusion
 
03:07:21.590 --> 03:07:21.600 align:start position:0%
among motorists and law enforcement
 
03:07:25.469 --> 03:07:25.479 align:start position:0%
agencies in conclusion Senate Bill 429
 
03:07:27.590 --> 03:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
is a common sense measure that will
 
03:07:29.790 --> 03:07:29.800 align:start position:0%
address an oversight in the plate
 
03:07:31.269 --> 03:07:31.279 align:start position:0%
production while upholding the
 
03:07:33.870 --> 03:07:33.880 align:start position:0%
historical and symbolic significance of
 
03:07:37.469 --> 03:07:37.479 align:start position:0%
the executive Council plates I ask the
 
03:07:39.110 --> 03:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
members of this committee to please
 
03:07:41.790 --> 03:07:41.800 align:start position:0%
support the bill and ensure its passage
 
03:07:43.830 --> 03:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
for the benefit of our state and thank
 
03:07:46.110 --> 03:07:46.120 align:start position:0%
you for your attention in this matter if
 
03:07:47.670 --> 03:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
you have any questions I'd be have happy
 
03:07:48.870 --> 03:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
to answer
 
03:07:51.070 --> 03:07:51.080 align:start position:0%
them okay thank you so much any
 
03:07:53.190 --> 03:07:53.200 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
03:07:55.510 --> 03:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
03:07:58.229 --> 03:07:58.239 align:start position:0%
sellers thank you Mr chair uh thanks for
 
03:08:01.110 --> 03:08:01.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question I don't see a cost on
 
03:08:03.269 --> 03:08:03.279 align:start position:0%
this is there any additional cost and
 
03:08:05.309 --> 03:08:05.319 align:start position:0%
and we we're only talking five plates
 
03:08:08.269 --> 03:08:08.279 align:start position:0%
right yes any additional cost are you
 
03:08:11.830 --> 03:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:11.840 --> 03:08:15.110 align:start position:0%
 
no

03:08:15.110 --> 03:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:17.790 --> 03:08:17.800 align:start position:0%
any no I believe there's no additional
 
03:08:20.030 --> 03:08:20.040 align:start position:0%
cost there's not I just wanted to
 
03:08:23.030 --> 03:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
confirm that um it just was an oversight
 
03:08:25.510 --> 03:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
and the executive Council was used to
 
03:08:28.229 --> 03:08:28.239 align:start position:0%
having that same plate but then you know
 
03:08:30.510 --> 03:08:30.520 align:start position:0%
being rule followers that we are we we
 
03:08:34.190 --> 03:08:34.200 align:start position:0%
realized that in the RSA so um look at
 
03:08:38.389 --> 03:08:38.399 align:start position:0%
it this way makes our executive Council
 
03:08:40.309 --> 03:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
happy any other questions from the
 
03:08:42.990 --> 03:08:43.000 align:start position:0%
committee representative sellers yeah
 
03:08:45.910 --> 03:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
thank you again um do they have a plate
 
03:08:49.030 --> 03:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
now yes but it's just not a certain
 
03:08:52.070 --> 03:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
color well they wanted to stay the way
 
03:08:54.710 --> 03:08:54.720 align:start position:0%
it always was which was the blue and the
 
03:08:58.590 --> 03:08:58.600 align:start position:0%
white and now they have been due to this
 
03:09:01.710 --> 03:09:01.720 align:start position:0%
RSA had to go to what we all have which
 
03:09:04.349 --> 03:09:04.359 align:start position:0%
is you know alternating the red and the
 
03:09:06.269 --> 03:09:06.279 align:start position:0%
green and they just want to remain the
 
03:09:09.269 --> 03:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:12.389 --> 03:09:12.399 align:start position:0%

03:09:14.950 --> 03:09:14.960 align:start position:0%

counselor Dave wheeler uh who supports
 
03:09:31.590 --> 03:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:34.070 --> 03:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you Mr chairman and and
 
03:09:37.190 --> 03:09:37.200 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um good
 
03:09:39.950 --> 03:09:39.960 align:start position:0%
afternoon and uh I guess I'll stop by
 
03:09:42.550 --> 03:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
answering the representative's question
 
03:09:43.830 --> 03:09:43.840 align:start position:0%
you can see in
 
03:09:46.429 --> 03:09:46.439 align:start position:0%
2021 uh we had the traditional Blue
 
03:09:49.469 --> 03:09:49.479 align:start position:0%
Plate and the director became aware of
 
03:09:52.429 --> 03:09:52.439 align:start position:0%
the statute for this term and realized
 
03:09:54.070 --> 03:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
that our plates should be green like
 
03:09:57.150 --> 03:09:57.160 align:start position:0%
yours uh under the law so this term we
 
03:10:00.110 --> 03:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
have green plates but for the last
 
03:10:02.830 --> 03:10:02.840 align:start position:0%
decades here's my here's my license
 
03:10:05.910 --> 03:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
plate from 2002 uh and you can see that
 
03:10:09.269 --> 03:10:09.279 align:start position:0%
they're blue and we've been blue as long
 
03:10:12.070 --> 03:10:12.080 align:start position:0%
as I can remember uh previous counselors
 
03:10:14.830 --> 03:10:14.840 align:start position:0%
before me so we we're simply asking if
 
03:10:17.349 --> 03:10:17.359 align:start position:0%
you could uh correct the law so we can
 
03:10:20.070 --> 03:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
continue our long-standing uh tradition
 
03:10:23.670 --> 03:10:23.680 align:start position:0%
of having uh the blue plates somehow
 
03:10:27.469 --> 03:10:27.479 align:start position:0%
along the line um we were we didn't stay
 
03:10:29.309 --> 03:10:29.319 align:start position:0%
aligned with the statute but we'd like
 
03:10:32.349 --> 03:10:32.359 align:start position:0%
to get that corrected and um ask that
 
03:10:33.630 --> 03:10:33.640 align:start position:0%
you pass this
 
03:10:36.469 --> 03:10:36.479 align:start position:0%

03:10:50.349 --> 03:10:50.359 align:start position:0%

sir thank you Mr chair members of the
 
03:11:03.309 --> 03:11:03.319 align:start position:0%
committee uh John morasco director of
 
03:11:06.229 --> 03:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
the DMV um just I would Echo everything
 
03:11:08.349 --> 03:11:08.359 align:start position:0%
that Senator richardi has testified to
 
03:11:10.469 --> 03:11:10.479 align:start position:0%
and councel Wheeler like to thank uh
 
03:11:11.990 --> 03:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
senator richardi for bringing this bill
 
03:11:14.990 --> 03:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
forth and for councelor wheeler for um
 
03:11:16.950 --> 03:11:16.960 align:start position:0%
uh having the conversation to get to
 
03:11:19.309 --> 03:11:19.319 align:start position:0%
this Point um we support the bill there
 
03:11:21.190 --> 03:11:21.200 align:start position:0%
is uh we did check with the plate room
 
03:11:23.150 --> 03:11:23.160 align:start position:0%
at the state prison there's no increased
 
03:11:25.950 --> 03:11:25.960 align:start position:0%
cost by doing this and um as both the
 
03:11:27.990 --> 03:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
senator and the counselor spoke to we
 
03:11:29.670 --> 03:11:29.680 align:start position:0%
did follow RSA
 
03:11:33.110 --> 03:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
26190 which um you know does identify
 
03:11:34.510 --> 03:11:34.520 align:start position:0%
the fact that every two years the plate
 
03:11:37.070 --> 03:11:37.080 align:start position:0%
should change from green to red and and
 
03:11:39.190 --> 03:11:39.200 align:start position:0%
that way um so we followed the law but
 
03:11:41.309 --> 03:11:41.319 align:start position:0%
in doing that that um did have a little
 
03:11:43.030 --> 03:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
bit of a a wrinkle here with this
 
03:11:45.030 --> 03:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
particular plate so we fully support the
 
03:11:46.750 --> 03:11:46.760 align:start position:0%
change and I'm happy to take any
 
03:11:46.760 --> 03:11:49.070 align:start position:0%
change and I'm happy to take any
questions

03:11:49.070 --> 03:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:11:55.469 --> 03:11:55.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:55.479 --> 03:11:57.309 align:start position:0%
 
committee

03:11:57.309 --> 03:11:57.319 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:11:59.229 --> 03:11:59.239 align:start position:0%
representative thank you I'm not sure if
 
03:12:02.630 --> 03:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
the question is for you or for you
 
03:12:04.950 --> 03:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
um I'm guessing and I just like
 
03:12:06.469 --> 03:12:06.479 align:start position:0%
confirmation that the reason that the
 
03:12:09.349 --> 03:12:09.359 align:start position:0%
legislator's plates change is to make it
 
03:12:13.429 --> 03:12:13.439 align:start position:0%
easy for say people at the garage to say
 
03:12:15.910 --> 03:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
you were not you were last term you're
 
03:12:18.190 --> 03:12:18.200 align:start position:0%
not this term is that that
 
03:12:20.269 --> 03:12:20.279 align:start position:0%
correct you know that's a great question
 
03:12:21.950 --> 03:12:21.960 align:start position:0%
I don't know the answer to it I can I
 
03:12:23.750 --> 03:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
can get you an answer to that I I know
 
03:12:26.070 --> 03:12:26.080 align:start position:0%
what the RSA reads and the fact that
 
03:12:28.190 --> 03:12:28.200 align:start position:0%
those changes have to take place but let
 
03:12:30.670 --> 03:12:30.680 align:start position:0%
me let me look into that I'm not sure I
 
03:12:32.229 --> 03:12:32.239 align:start position:0%
there there are dates on those plates
 
03:12:33.990 --> 03:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
aren't there
 
03:12:38.469 --> 03:12:38.479 align:start position:0%
yes so um I I'm just wondering why
 
03:12:40.389 --> 03:12:40.399 align:start position:0%
anybody needs to change the color of the
 
03:12:42.550 --> 03:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
plates if the dates are on them already
 
03:12:42.560 --> 03:12:46.110 align:start position:0%
plates if the dates are on them already
thank

03:12:46.110 --> 03:12:46.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:48.349 --> 03:12:48.359 align:start position:0%
you someone wants to answer this the
 
03:12:48.359 --> 03:12:49.870 align:start position:0%
you someone wants to answer this the
representative

03:12:49.870 --> 03:12:49.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:12:49.880 --> 03:12:51.750 align:start position:0%
representative
question

03:12:51.750 --> 03:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:12:57.469 --> 03:12:57.479 align:start position:0%
present as I recall um and George May or
 
03:12:59.510 --> 03:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
representative syes may have a bet I
 
03:13:02.710 --> 03:13:02.720 align:start position:0%
think it had to do with the ability to
 
03:13:06.110 --> 03:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
get into the parks and the boat Ducks
 
03:13:08.389 --> 03:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
and the other and and so the colors
 
03:13:11.190 --> 03:13:11.200 align:start position:0%
mattered from year to year so someone
 
03:13:15.150 --> 03:13:15.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't just have um a red plate and
 
03:13:18.830 --> 03:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
think that they could um have their Bo
 
03:13:20.670 --> 03:13:20.680 align:start position:0%
they were current no one was looking at
 
03:13:23.030 --> 03:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
the actual date of the plate that was my

about an unrelated matter and that is
 
03:13:47.110 --> 03:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
when the sentence about the blue was uh

03:23:30.510 --> 03:23:30.520 align:start position:0%
London um I am here today in introducing
 
03:23:33.189 --> 03:23:33.199 align:start position:0%
this bill um because I have a vested
 
03:23:36.870 --> 03:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
interest in preventing injuries in New
 
03:23:39.229 --> 03:23:39.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire preventing injuries that cause
 
03:23:41.590 --> 03:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
disabilities impacting quality of life
 
03:23:43.550 --> 03:23:43.560 align:start position:0%
as well as death and although this is a
 
03:23:45.510 --> 03:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
transportation committee I'm just going
 
03:23:46.950 --> 03:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
to talk to you a little bit about injury
 
03:23:48.870 --> 03:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
and why it's such a problem and then
 
03:23:50.790 --> 03:23:50.800 align:start position:0%
take you to why this could be one
 
03:23:52.429 --> 03:23:52.439 align:start position:0%
solution that could help us actually
 
03:23:55.550 --> 03:23:55.560 align:start position:0%
expand our programs outside of the tight
 
03:23:57.349 --> 03:23:57.359 align:start position:0%
braided funding that already comes to
 
03:23:59.469 --> 03:23:59.479 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire so some of
 
03:24:00.950 --> 03:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
you might know but some of you that
 
03:24:02.429 --> 03:24:02.439 align:start position:0%
don't by way of background I'm a
 
03:24:04.189 --> 03:24:04.199 align:start position:0%
paramedic and I've worked in the
 
03:24:06.189 --> 03:24:06.199 align:start position:0%
development and implementation of
 
03:24:08.309 --> 03:24:08.319 align:start position:0%
systems of care specifically trauma
 
03:24:10.790 --> 03:24:10.800 align:start position:0%
systems since
 
03:24:14.510 --> 03:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
1999 um so these systems of care take
 
03:24:17.110 --> 03:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
into account a continuum so that makes
 
03:24:19.830 --> 03:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
up that's um parts that make up a whole
 
03:24:23.030 --> 03:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
from preventing injuries to empowering
 
03:24:24.750 --> 03:24:24.760 align:start position:0%
the survivors and the road to
 
03:24:26.389 --> 03:24:26.399 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation not just physical
 
03:24:29.030 --> 03:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation but healing the emotional
 
03:24:31.309 --> 03:24:31.319 align:start position:0%
wounds from injury on the other side and
 
03:24:32.870 --> 03:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
everything in between which are
 
03:24:35.349 --> 03:24:35.359 align:start position:0%
ambulances helicopters Trauma Center
 
03:24:38.630 --> 03:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
Care this is these are systems of care
 
03:24:41.510 --> 03:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
um that we support and preventing
 
03:24:44.030 --> 03:24:44.040 align:start position:0%
injuries means two things one we can
 
03:24:46.630 --> 03:24:46.640 align:start position:0%
save lives and two the folks that are
 
03:24:50.070 --> 03:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
injured and do survive we can actually
 
03:24:52.469 --> 03:24:52.479 align:start position:0%
cut down their cost related to their
 
03:24:54.870 --> 03:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
care and ultimately cost it could be Rel
 
03:24:58.670 --> 03:24:58.680 align:start position:0%
that can be associated with with Society
 
03:25:00.590 --> 03:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
so let's talk a little bit more about
 
03:25:04.790 --> 03:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
this um but before I start I do want to
 
03:25:07.469 --> 03:25:07.479 align:start position:0%
take a moment to honor somebody that you
 
03:25:09.910 --> 03:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
all um that you some of you might know
 
03:25:11.389 --> 03:25:11.399 align:start position:0%
some of you might not know her name is
 
03:25:14.229 --> 03:25:14.239 align:start position:0%
Elaine Frank Elaine Frank was the
 
03:25:16.030 --> 03:25:16.040 align:start position:0%
director of the injury prevention center
 
03:25:19.389 --> 03:25:19.399 align:start position:0%
at Dartmouth for
 
03:25:22.269 --> 03:25:22.279 align:start position:0%
oh in since the 90s and I actually got
 
03:25:24.469 --> 03:25:24.479 align:start position:0%
to know her in 1992 when I worked on a
 
03:25:27.510 --> 03:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
project at the medical school and we
 
03:25:29.790 --> 03:25:29.800 align:start position:0%
were friends up until the day of her
 
03:25:31.269 --> 03:25:31.279 align:start position:0%
passing in
 
03:25:34.269 --> 03:25:34.279 align:start position:0%
2023 she sat in this chair many times
 
03:25:37.269 --> 03:25:37.279 align:start position:0%
and in other chairs throughout the lob
 
03:25:39.550 --> 03:25:39.560 align:start position:0%
and the State House advocating on behalf
 
03:25:42.030 --> 03:25:42.040 align:start position:0%
of programs that would you know save
 
03:25:44.830 --> 03:25:44.840 align:start position:0%
lives and that would reduce injuries I
 
03:25:46.510 --> 03:25:46.520 align:start position:0%
worked with her and watched her effort
 
03:25:48.670 --> 03:25:48.680 align:start position:0%
to improve the lives of granite Staters
 
03:25:51.469 --> 03:25:51.479 align:start position:0%
through her prevention work never tiring
 
03:25:55.790 --> 03:25:55.800 align:start position:0%
she was the best listener planner and
 
03:25:55.800 --> 03:25:57.389 align:start position:0%
she was the best listener planner and
ultimately

03:25:57.389 --> 03:25:57.399 align:start position:0%
ultimately
 
03:25:59.590 --> 03:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
collaborator she knew how to bring
 
03:26:01.590 --> 03:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
people together around prevention and
 
03:26:03.269 --> 03:26:03.279 align:start position:0%
I'm honored to have known her and to
 
03:26:06.510 --> 03:26:06.520 align:start position:0%
call her my friend and I dedicate this
 
03:26:09.910 --> 03:26:09.920 align:start position:0%
work to a lame Frank with that being
 
03:26:12.910 --> 03:26:12.920 align:start position:0%
said uh we are what we would like to see
 
03:26:15.590 --> 03:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
pass is the Authority for us to issue a
 
03:26:19.429 --> 03:26:19.439 align:start position:0%
decal plate that would be the funds that
 
03:26:21.030 --> 03:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
the revenue that was associated with
 
03:26:24.309 --> 03:26:24.319 align:start position:0%
that would become would be would go to
 
03:26:25.670 --> 03:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
the injury prevention center at
 
03:26:27.910 --> 03:26:27.920 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth so they could expand their
 
03:26:29.870 --> 03:26:29.880 align:start position:0%
current programming which I have some
 
03:26:31.349 --> 03:26:31.359 align:start position:0%
information on the Department of Health
 
03:26:32.990 --> 03:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
and Human Service Health and Human
 
03:26:35.910 --> 03:26:35.920 align:start position:0%
Services has some information on as well
 
03:26:39.550 --> 03:26:39.560 align:start position:0%
so the again this is about preventing
 
03:26:42.070 --> 03:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
injuries supporting programs Statewide
 
03:26:44.189 --> 03:26:44.199 align:start position:0%
and ultim through the injury prevention
 
03:26:46.229 --> 03:26:46.239 align:start position:0%
center this should be a dedicated sour
 
03:26:47.990 --> 03:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
source to build out current and future
 
03:26:49.990 --> 03:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
efforts and we actually have a 5-year
 
03:26:52.910 --> 03:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
injury prevention plan so every 5 years
 
03:26:55.429 --> 03:26:55.439 align:start position:0%
we issue a new plan 20125 the current
 
03:26:58.070 --> 03:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
plan will be up the current plan which
 
03:27:00.830 --> 03:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
you can access on the HHS website says
 
03:27:02.510 --> 03:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
injuries whether intentional or
 
03:27:04.790 --> 03:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
unintentional make a substantial
 
03:27:07.510 --> 03:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
physical emotional and economic impacts
 
03:27:10.030 --> 03:27:10.040 align:start position:0%
on society that can have lasting
 
03:27:13.830 --> 03:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
consequences in 2018 there were
 
03:27:16.189 --> 03:27:16.199 align:start position:0%
1277 injury related death in New
 
03:27:19.150 --> 03:27:19.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire affecting families schools and
 
03:27:21.830 --> 03:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
workplaces and communities the Fatal
 
03:27:24.870 --> 03:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
injuries cost over 1 billion in a
 
03:27:27.269 --> 03:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
lifetime of medical expenses and work
 
03:27:30.030 --> 03:27:30.040 align:start position:0%
lost which translates into
 
03:27:33.950 --> 03:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
$771 per capita in New Hampshire so in
 
03:27:35.990 --> 03:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
2025 we'll have an updated report and
 
03:27:38.550 --> 03:27:38.560 align:start position:0%
we'll see those numbers be updated U and
 
03:27:40.550 --> 03:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
I think what we know when from watching
 
03:27:42.790 --> 03:27:42.800 align:start position:0%
the news is that the one thing which is
 
03:27:44.590 --> 03:27:44.600 align:start position:0%
you know motor vehicle crashes
 
03:27:46.510 --> 03:27:46.520 align:start position:0%
motorcycle crashes and now we even have
 
03:27:48.469 --> 03:27:48.479 align:start position:0%
the introduction of you know some of the
 
03:27:50.750 --> 03:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
electronic devices scooters and such
 
03:27:53.469 --> 03:27:53.479 align:start position:0%
we're still seeing injuries and death
 
03:27:56.269 --> 03:27:56.279 align:start position:0%
not level off but actually um take a
 
03:27:59.030 --> 03:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
rise I pull the majority of my data
 
03:28:01.110 --> 03:28:01.120 align:start position:0%
besides what I just shared with you from
 
03:28:03.510 --> 03:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
DHHS from the Centers for Disease
 
03:28:05.469 --> 03:28:05.479 align:start position:0%
Control specifically their whiskers
 
03:28:07.870 --> 03:28:07.880 align:start position:0%
database this is publicly available you
 
03:28:12.469 --> 03:28:12.479 align:start position:0%
can um you can actually change the ages
 
03:28:13.790 --> 03:28:13.800 align:start position:0%
and the types of things that you're
 
03:28:16.349 --> 03:28:16.359 align:start position:0%
looking for so you can like more qualify
 
03:28:18.950 --> 03:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
and specify your data so here's what the
 
03:28:21.550 --> 03:28:21.560 align:start position:0%
CDC says about New Hampshire injury
 
03:28:24.550 --> 03:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
Remains the leading cause of death
 
03:28:27.349 --> 03:28:27.359 align:start position:0%
between the ages of 1 and 44 in New
 
03:28:29.469 --> 03:28:29.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire occupies High rates of
 
03:28:32.070 --> 03:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations in beds more often than
 
03:28:34.950 --> 03:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
cancer heart disease and AIDS combined
 
03:28:37.870 --> 03:28:37.880 align:start position:0%
the costs to individuals their families
 
03:28:40.550 --> 03:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
and back to society are staggering and
 
03:28:43.269 --> 03:28:43.279 align:start position:0%
yet this is
 
03:28:45.389 --> 03:28:45.399 align:start position:0%
preventable you know I've been in my
 
03:28:47.830 --> 03:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
work I've been thinking about this for
 
03:28:49.910 --> 03:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
years and we know that the burden of
 
03:28:52.590 --> 03:28:52.600 align:start position:0%
injury it's not often talked about and I
 
03:28:54.070 --> 03:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
feel like sometimes it's a little bit of
 
03:28:56.269 --> 03:28:56.279 align:start position:0%
Groundhog Day and I wish Dr Patterson
 
03:28:57.590 --> 03:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
Lisa Patterson who's the head of the
 
03:28:59.870 --> 03:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
trauma program at conquered hospital was
 
03:29:02.469 --> 03:29:02.479 align:start position:0%
able to join us today uh because she
 
03:29:05.189 --> 03:29:05.199 align:start position:0%
points out um something that I've always
 
03:29:07.189 --> 03:29:07.199 align:start position:0%
carried with me is that I can I have
 
03:29:09.630 --> 03:29:09.640 align:start position:0%
this conversation about how this is a
 
03:29:12.110 --> 03:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
leading cause of death for really the
 
03:29:16.070 --> 03:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
young okay and that it is it goes Rel
 
03:29:19.750 --> 03:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
Rel atively unnoticed until we have
 
03:29:21.950 --> 03:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
these kinds of conversations it's not
 
03:29:25.150 --> 03:29:25.160 align:start position:0%
for lack of trying but it's so episodic
 
03:29:26.990 --> 03:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
you don't leave your house
 
03:29:29.870 --> 03:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
expecting to unfortunately be in a crash
 
03:29:32.070 --> 03:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
you don't leave your house expecting to
 
03:29:35.070 --> 03:29:35.080 align:start position:0%
take a fall like things happen but we
 
03:29:37.189 --> 03:29:37.199 align:start position:0%
have mechanisms we can put in place that
 
03:29:39.229 --> 03:29:39.239 align:start position:0%
can prevent some of these things from
 
03:29:41.950 --> 03:29:41.960 align:start position:0%
happening and I actually want to point
 
03:29:44.309 --> 03:29:44.319 align:start position:0%
over to my colleague from Lebanon U just
 
03:29:45.469 --> 03:29:45.479 align:start position:0%
for a moment talk a little bit about
 
03:29:47.670 --> 03:29:47.680 align:start position:0%
fire prevention vention that if we've
 
03:29:49.670 --> 03:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
learned anything we've learned from the
 
03:29:53.309 --> 03:29:53.319 align:start position:0%
fire prevention community that we have
 
03:29:54.950 --> 03:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
pushed down the numbers we've dropped
 
03:29:57.550 --> 03:29:57.560 align:start position:0%
the numbers of building fires because of
 
03:30:00.150 --> 03:30:00.160 align:start position:0%
the focus on fire prevention and the
 
03:30:01.790 --> 03:30:01.800 align:start position:0%
fire departments for the building fires
 
03:30:03.990 --> 03:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
that they have they do an incredible job
 
03:30:05.870 --> 03:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
but many of them and they proudly will
 
03:30:07.990 --> 03:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
say it are providing Emergency Medical
 
03:30:09.710 --> 03:30:09.720 align:start position:0%
Services because people are still
 
03:30:12.790 --> 03:30:12.800 align:start position:0%
getting hurt and people are still sick
 
03:30:15.110 --> 03:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
so we can follow in the footsteps of the
 
03:30:17.150 --> 03:30:17.160 align:start position:0%
great work of Fire prevention in doing
 
03:30:19.510 --> 03:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
our injury prevention work on this side
 
03:30:21.389 --> 03:30:21.399 align:start position:0%
as well and this is something that has
 
03:30:24.870 --> 03:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
happened Nationwide so this proposed
 
03:30:27.830 --> 03:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
Bill brings forward a new um new but not
 
03:30:30.189 --> 03:30:30.199 align:start position:0%
new to injury source of funding and by
 
03:30:31.950 --> 03:30:31.960 align:start position:0%
choice for our Granite Staters so they
 
03:30:34.710 --> 03:30:34.720 align:start position:0%
would choose that they want to purchase
 
03:30:37.349 --> 03:30:37.359 align:start position:0%
a decal plate and they want to choose
 
03:30:39.950 --> 03:30:39.960 align:start position:0%
and the injury prevention decal in
 
03:30:41.670 --> 03:30:41.680 align:start position:0%
particular it will raise a level of
 
03:30:43.750 --> 03:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
awareness around injury and again it
 
03:30:46.389 --> 03:30:46.399 align:start position:0%
will provide some well-needed Revenue
 
03:30:49.349 --> 03:30:49.359 align:start position:0%
that we can actually expand the numbers
 
03:30:52.030 --> 03:30:52.040 align:start position:0%
and types of programs that are made
 
03:30:55.750 --> 03:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
available um so with that um I have Abby
 
03:30:57.950 --> 03:30:57.960 align:start position:0%
Rogers from DHHS here because I can talk
 
03:31:00.550 --> 03:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
about the way that funding is structured
 
03:31:02.670 --> 03:31:02.680 align:start position:0%
right now unfortunately Dr Patterson
 
03:31:05.070 --> 03:31:05.080 align:start position:0%
could not join us today but she would
 
03:31:07.349 --> 03:31:07.359 align:start position:0%
say um and it's in the Senate hearing
 
03:31:09.590 --> 03:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
report she would talk about just what I
 
03:31:11.469 --> 03:31:11.479 align:start position:0%
did in terms of how many lives are lost
 
03:31:13.950 --> 03:31:13.960 align:start position:0%
to this the age groups of them and that
 
03:31:17.110 --> 03:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
this is just it's relatively it comes
 
03:31:19.990 --> 03:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's relatively silent until it is
 
03:31:22.349 --> 03:31:22.359 align:start position:0%
literally on your doorstep and we know
 
03:31:24.830 --> 03:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
that we can prevent injuries I will wrap
 
03:31:27.030 --> 03:31:27.040 align:start position:0%
up here I'm certainly um happy to take
 
03:31:29.590 --> 03:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
any questions that you might have but I
 
03:31:31.990 --> 03:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
I want to point out that in all of the
 
03:31:35.229 --> 03:31:35.239 align:start position:0%
AED boxes around these buil in the lob
 
03:31:38.870 --> 03:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
we have uh boxes for automatic external
 
03:31:40.590 --> 03:31:40.600 align:start position:0%
defibrillators we have them over in the
 
03:31:42.389 --> 03:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
state house and now we actually passed a
 
03:31:45.309 --> 03:31:45.319 align:start position:0%
law last year that puts these that puts
 
03:31:48.150 --> 03:31:48.160 align:start position:0%
turnic kits which are now in those boxes
 
03:31:51.590 --> 03:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
in hight TR state buildings that there's
 
03:31:53.189 --> 03:31:53.199 align:start position:0%
a pro you don't have to be trained to
 
03:31:54.830 --> 03:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
use those but if you wanted to learn
 
03:31:56.790 --> 03:31:56.800 align:start position:0%
more you could take a stop the bleed
 
03:31:59.389 --> 03:31:59.399 align:start position:0%
program okay and this would help do that
 
03:32:02.269 --> 03:32:02.279 align:start position:0%
so we are taking steps as a legislature
 
03:32:04.710 --> 03:32:04.720 align:start position:0%
and you know very deliberatively to try
 
03:32:07.910 --> 03:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
to reduce injuries and death related to
 
03:32:10.389 --> 03:32:10.399 align:start position:0%
injuries by putting tourniquets in with
 
03:32:12.750 --> 03:32:12.760 align:start position:0%
our aeds and making them available so I
 
03:32:14.950 --> 03:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
will wrap with that and do my best to
 
03:32:16.710 --> 03:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that you might have
 
03:32:18.670 --> 03:32:18.680 align:start position:0%
and I do
 
03:32:21.469 --> 03:32:21.479 align:start position:0%
appreciate um your time today and I have
 
03:32:24.710 --> 03:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
a I've been given a a prop to you know
 
03:32:26.389 --> 03:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
to show I think you're all familiar with
 
03:32:30.070 --> 03:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
these so Mr chair thank you and I'll let
 
03:32:32.510 --> 03:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
you direct question then thank you so
 
03:32:34.189 --> 03:32:34.199 align:start position:0%
much Senator any questions from the
 
03:32:37.590 --> 03:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:39.990 --> 03:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
Hill thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
03:32:42.469 --> 03:32:42.479 align:start position:0%
senator for coming and visiting us today
 
03:32:44.429 --> 03:32:44.439 align:start position:0%
um I just have one question luckily I'm
 
03:32:46.630 --> 03:32:46.640 align:start position:0%
outside that 1 to 44 four range so I
 
03:32:49.070 --> 03:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
don't have to worry about injury but um
 
03:32:52.550 --> 03:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
too I I was uh aside from Charlie I
 
03:32:57.590 --> 03:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
think we're all set um uh the I'm I'm
 
03:32:59.429 --> 03:32:59.439 align:start position:0%
curious about the fact that the funding
 
03:33:02.990 --> 03:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
would only go to Dartmouth um is that
 
03:33:04.830 --> 03:33:04.840 align:start position:0%
did I hear that correctly and why would
 
03:33:07.750 --> 03:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
that be thank you for your question um
 
03:33:10.389 --> 03:33:10.399 align:start position:0%
so the way it is structured and I'm
 
03:33:12.030 --> 03:33:12.040 align:start position:0%
going to have Abby talk to this is there
 
03:33:13.469 --> 03:33:13.479 align:start position:0%
are funds that come into the state of
 
03:33:14.830 --> 03:33:14.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that support injury
 
03:33:14.840 --> 03:33:16.469 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that support injury
prevention

03:33:16.469 --> 03:33:16.479 align:start position:0%
prevention
 
03:33:18.550 --> 03:33:18.560 align:start position:0%
and then those funds through a
 
03:33:22.229 --> 03:33:22.239 align:start position:0%
competitive RFP process okay are set
 
03:33:24.429 --> 03:33:24.439 align:start position:0%
aside and they search for an injury
 
03:33:25.870 --> 03:33:25.880 align:start position:0%
prevention center and I remember
 
03:33:26.870 --> 03:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
actually when I worked in state
 
03:33:28.750 --> 03:33:28.760 align:start position:0%
government I was on the Review Committee
 
03:33:30.510 --> 03:33:30.520 align:start position:0%
for the injury prevention center so
 
03:33:32.910 --> 03:33:32.920 align:start position:0%
these are awarded to Dartmouth like they
 
03:33:35.150 --> 03:33:35.160 align:start position:0%
could be awarded to anybody that
 
03:33:36.910 --> 03:33:36.920 align:start position:0%
actually met the requirements that were
 
03:33:40.229 --> 03:33:40.239 align:start position:0%
put forward so that's why it goes there
 
03:33:42.750 --> 03:33:42.760 align:start position:0%
okay so it is not that we are supporting
 
03:33:44.389 --> 03:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth directly they are the
 
03:33:47.229 --> 03:33:47.239 align:start position:0%
deliverer of injury prevention programs
 
03:33:49.510 --> 03:33:49.520 align:start position:0%
by way of a contract that is funded
 
03:33:53.229 --> 03:33:53.239 align:start position:0%
through HHS a competitive process you're
 
03:33:55.269 --> 03:33:55.279 align:start position:0%
welcome representative
 
03:33:59.790 --> 03:33:59.800 align:start position:0%
Sykes thank you Mr chairman so um I was
 
03:34:01.550 --> 03:34:01.560 align:start position:0%
pleased to hear you talk about Elaine
 
03:34:04.910 --> 03:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
Frank um she also was a friend of mine
 
03:34:07.830 --> 03:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
we we uh had a long history together of
 
03:34:09.750 --> 03:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
trying to make a difference in the world
 
03:34:12.429 --> 03:34:12.439 align:start position:0%
starting with um for my colleagues
 
03:34:15.750 --> 03:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
benefit something called uh slip stps
 
03:34:19.189 --> 03:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
and Falls avoid them all kind of program
 
03:34:20.790 --> 03:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
we did that at Rogers house together
 
03:34:22.429 --> 03:34:22.439 align:start position:0%
yeah we did that at Rogers house which
 
03:34:24.349 --> 03:34:24.359 align:start position:0%
was an elderly housing facility and it
 
03:34:25.790 --> 03:34:25.800 align:start position:0%
made a difference and it actually
 
03:34:27.830 --> 03:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
continued to make a difference what I
 
03:34:30.429 --> 03:34:30.439 align:start position:0%
what I think one of the messages I would
 
03:34:33.469 --> 03:34:33.479 align:start position:0%
like the committee to hear about is that
 
03:34:35.910 --> 03:34:35.920 align:start position:0%
these little steps that don't seem all
 
03:34:39.070 --> 03:34:39.080 align:start position:0%
that significant um they have a way of
 
03:34:42.110 --> 03:34:42.120 align:start position:0%
morphing into bigger and better ways to
 
03:34:44.630 --> 03:34:44.640 align:start position:0%
deal with common problems and that's why
 
03:34:47.389 --> 03:34:47.399 align:start position:0%
now uh Progressive fire departments are
 
03:34:50.710 --> 03:34:50.720 align:start position:0%
doing uh Community nursing programs
 
03:34:53.189 --> 03:34:53.199 align:start position:0%
they're doing uh they're getting they're
 
03:34:55.469 --> 03:34:55.479 align:start position:0%
having paramedics who go into the home
 
03:34:59.510 --> 03:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
to try and um help people with avoiding
 
03:35:01.870 --> 03:35:01.880 align:start position:0%
or working on their health issues uh
 
03:35:03.990 --> 03:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
something that I'm very familiar with
 
03:35:07.229 --> 03:35:07.239 align:start position:0%
recently so I think anything that this
 
03:35:10.950 --> 03:35:10.960 align:start position:0%
legislature could do I I my question is
 
03:35:13.110 --> 03:35:13.120 align:start position:0%
I assume that you would be in support of
 
03:35:15.269 --> 03:35:15.279 align:start position:0%
getting this message out as much as
 
03:35:15.279 --> 03:35:17.750 align:start position:0%
getting this message out as much as
possible

03:35:17.750 --> 03:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:20.990 --> 03:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the comment and our
 
03:35:24.429 --> 03:35:24.439 align:start position:0%
shared love of Elaine Frank um and I and
 
03:35:26.309 --> 03:35:26.319 align:start position:0%
your the answer to your question is
 
03:35:27.990 --> 03:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
anything we can do and I believe I said
 
03:35:29.990 --> 03:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
this in the in the very early part of my
 
03:35:32.710 --> 03:35:32.720 align:start position:0%
introduction is it would provide a
 
03:35:34.469 --> 03:35:34.479 align:start position:0%
revenue Source a dedicated Revenue
 
03:35:37.990 --> 03:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
Source by choice okay so if somebody
 
03:35:40.710 --> 03:35:40.720 align:start position:0%
wants to make this purchase they can but
 
03:35:43.990 --> 03:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
I also think the benefit of this is
 
03:35:46.950 --> 03:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
raising the level of the conversation
 
03:35:50.030 --> 03:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
around how important preventing injury
 
03:35:52.469 --> 03:35:52.479 align:start position:0%
is and how prevalent injury is in our
 
03:35:55.389 --> 03:35:55.399 align:start position:0%
society and although I focused in on the
 
03:35:56.429 --> 03:35:56.439 align:start position:0%
one through
 
03:36:00.110 --> 03:36:00.120 align:start position:0%
44 let's you know I can't leave this
 
03:36:01.710 --> 03:36:01.720 align:start position:0%
table without saying that when you start
 
03:36:05.670 --> 03:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
to qualify the data on over
 
03:36:08.710 --> 03:36:08.720 align:start position:0%
55 what we find so the 1 through 44 is a
 
03:36:11.189 --> 03:36:11.199 align:start position:0%
lot of Motor Vehicle crashes or
 
03:36:14.189 --> 03:36:14.199 align:start position:0%
motorcycle crashes you know pedestrian
 
03:36:16.110 --> 03:36:16.120 align:start position:0%
but when we start to talk about Falls
 
03:36:18.070 --> 03:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
anything we can do to prevent Falls over
 
03:36:20.870 --> 03:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
55 we can actually save a life within a
 
03:36:23.070 --> 03:36:23.080 align:start position:0%
year greater than the age of 55 with
 
03:36:26.030 --> 03:36:26.040 align:start position:0%
even one medical condition and a fall
 
03:36:29.030 --> 03:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
which may seem simple could morph itself
 
03:36:32.030 --> 03:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
into something that becomes you know
 
03:36:35.030 --> 03:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
ultimately deadly so I focused in on the
 
03:36:37.550 --> 03:36:37.560 align:start position:0%
youth well that you know uh but this
 
03:36:38.910 --> 03:36:38.920 align:start position:0%
really impacts
 
03:36:41.510 --> 03:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
everybody thank you any other questions
 
03:36:43.429 --> 03:36:43.439 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative
 
03:36:45.630 --> 03:36:45.640 align:start position:0%
pemon thank you Mr chair thank you
 
03:36:47.950 --> 03:36:47.960 align:start position:0%
Senator my question is on the example of
 
03:36:50.229 --> 03:36:50.239 align:start position:0%
the plate the sticker plate um what
 
03:36:52.429 --> 03:36:52.439 align:start position:0%
would we would we be looking at a blue
 
03:36:54.229 --> 03:36:54.239 align:start position:0%
sticker or will it be something that
 
03:36:57.870 --> 03:36:57.880 align:start position:0%
says drive safely avoid slips and Falls
 
03:37:01.070 --> 03:37:01.080 align:start position:0%
would it be something of the message on
 
03:37:03.790 --> 03:37:03.800 align:start position:0%
the plate so thank you representative
 
03:37:05.710 --> 03:37:05.720 align:start position:0%
and thank you for the question so it
 
03:37:07.070 --> 03:37:07.080 align:start position:0%
will be ultimately up to the
 
03:37:08.710 --> 03:37:08.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of Safety
 
03:37:12.309 --> 03:37:12.319 align:start position:0%
to take the input and design what would
 
03:37:14.189 --> 03:37:14.199 align:start position:0%
fit in a small space that could then
 
03:37:16.870 --> 03:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
become universally recognized ized
 
03:37:20.950 --> 03:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
so injury prevention covers
 
03:37:20.960 --> 03:37:22.670 align:start position:0%
so injury prevention covers
crashes

03:37:22.670 --> 03:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
crashes
 
03:37:25.670 --> 03:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
Falls um it actually can cover acts of
 
03:37:28.510 --> 03:37:28.520 align:start position:0%
violence as well so I'm not I don't know
 
03:37:30.189 --> 03:37:30.199 align:start position:0%
what it will be but I trust that the
 
03:37:32.349 --> 03:37:32.359 align:start position:0%
commissioner like commissioners before
 
03:37:35.269 --> 03:37:35.279 align:start position:0%
them have worked to come up with designs
 
03:37:38.070 --> 03:37:38.080 align:start position:0%
that can fit here and make a statement
 
03:37:39.550 --> 03:37:39.560 align:start position:0%
um and would obviously we would
 
03:37:43.349 --> 03:37:43.359 align:start position:0%
cooperate and uh be cheerleaders in
 
03:37:46.990 --> 03:37:47.000 align:start position:0%
that any other questions from the
 
03:37:48.990 --> 03:37:49.000 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you Senator thank

death and disability from injury the
 
03:39:02.229 --> 03:39:02.239 align:start position:0%
dphs injury prevention program works
 
03:39:03.429 --> 03:39:03.439 align:start position:0%
with Community Partners such as
 
03:39:04.830 --> 03:39:04.840 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Health injury prevention
 
03:39:07.150 --> 03:39:07.160 align:start position:0%
center to reduce these preventable
 
03:39:09.510 --> 03:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
deaths and disabilities currently the
 
03:39:11.630 --> 03:39:11.640 align:start position:0%
funding for DHHS which Senator appren
 
03:39:12.870 --> 03:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
just referenced injury prevention
 
03:39:15.030 --> 03:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
programs contract is with Dartmouth
 
03:39:16.950 --> 03:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
health injury prevention center and it
 
03:39:18.630 --> 03:39:18.640 align:start position:0%
comes primarily through the source of
 
03:39:20.429 --> 03:39:20.439 align:start position:0%
federal funds Health Resources and
 
03:39:20.439 --> 03:39:21.550 align:start position:0%

block grants um these Federal resources
 
03:39:37.830 --> 03:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
are super important to support support
 
03:39:40.389 --> 03:39:40.399 align:start position:0%
our data collection analysis and
 
03:39:42.710 --> 03:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
Community Based prevention strategies at
 
03:39:44.110 --> 03:39:44.120 align:start position:0%
uh that that are done through Dartmouth
 
03:39:46.590 --> 03:39:46.600 align:start position:0%
Health uh injury convention center and
 
03:39:49.070 --> 03:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
all of the efforts that DHHS works on in
 
03:39:50.550 --> 03:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
coordination with other partners are
 
03:39:52.189 --> 03:39:52.199 align:start position:0%
designed to provote effective Public
 
03:39:54.309 --> 03:39:54.319 align:start position:0%
Health uh solutions to injury and
 
03:39:56.429 --> 03:39:56.439 align:start position:0%
prevent harm in the first place um
 
03:39:58.630 --> 03:39:58.640 align:start position:0%
contractual activities to support the
 
03:40:00.830 --> 03:40:00.840 align:start position:0%
program follow the New Hampshire
 
03:40:02.950 --> 03:40:02.960 align:start position:0%
violence and injury prevention state
 
03:40:05.630 --> 03:40:05.640 align:start position:0%
plan which is 2020 through 2025 so a
 
03:40:07.950 --> 03:40:07.960 align:start position:0%
five-year block grant um and just
 
03:40:09.630 --> 03:40:09.640 align:start position:0%
basically we're here to say that if if
 
03:40:11.469 --> 03:40:11.479 align:start position:0%
the bill was enacted we would this would
 
03:40:13.189 --> 03:40:13.199 align:start position:0%
enable the injury prevention center to
 
03:40:15.309 --> 03:40:15.319 align:start position:0%
increase its capacity for implementing
 
03:40:16.990 --> 03:40:17.000 align:start position:0%
important community- based interventions
 
03:40:19.790 --> 03:40:19.800 align:start position:0%
to uh prevent injury so that's my
 
03:40:21.630 --> 03:40:21.640 align:start position:0%
testimony and we again thank Senator
 
03:40:23.309 --> 03:40:23.319 align:start position:0%
Apprentice for bringing the bill
 
03:40:25.750 --> 03:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
forward thank you so much any questions
 
03:40:27.990 --> 03:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative
 
03:40:30.030 --> 03:40:30.040 align:start position:0%
Hill uh thank you and thank you for
 
03:40:33.229 --> 03:40:33.239 align:start position:0%
taking my question um who is going to
 
03:40:37.870 --> 03:40:37.880 align:start position:0%
pay the uh the cost of this upfront um
 
03:40:40.030 --> 03:40:40.040 align:start position:0%
the there is a typical I think it's
 
03:40:42.630 --> 03:40:42.640 align:start position:0%
actually even on the bill a $10,000 cost
 
03:40:45.830 --> 03:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
for the initial um
 
03:40:48.670 --> 03:40:48.680 align:start position:0%
outlay the outlay I'm not I'm not sure I
 
03:40:50.950 --> 03:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's our department
 
03:40:53.870 --> 03:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
um okay yeah sorry it's not the HHS and
 
03:40:54.910 --> 03:40:54.920 align:start position:0%
I don't believe it comes out of our
 
03:40:57.910 --> 03:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
block grant okay thank you sure
 
03:41:00.429 --> 03:41:00.439 align:start position:0%
representative sers thank you Mr
 
03:41:04.269 --> 03:41:04.279 align:start position:0%
chair um is this program fully funded
 
03:41:08.189 --> 03:41:08.199 align:start position:0%
now and is this the the decal is only
 
03:41:10.990 --> 03:41:11.000 align:start position:0%
for getting more people to aware or is
 
03:41:13.510 --> 03:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
it are you trying to raise money to help
 
03:41:16.389 --> 03:41:16.399 align:start position:0%
fund this program so my understanding is
 
03:41:19.189 --> 03:41:19.199 align:start position:0%
the decal serves two purposes as other
 
03:41:20.990 --> 03:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
um organizations that are in the decal
 
03:41:23.189 --> 03:41:23.199 align:start position:0%
program right to raise awareness of an
 
03:41:24.469 --> 03:41:24.479 align:start position:0%
important cause and certainly this is a
 
03:41:26.189 --> 03:41:26.199 align:start position:0%
very important cause preventing injury
 
03:41:28.830 --> 03:41:28.840 align:start position:0%
prevention um and I'm sorry what was the
 
03:41:30.750 --> 03:41:30.760 align:start position:0%
second part of your
 
03:41:33.110 --> 03:41:33.120 align:start position:0%
question is it is the program fully
 
03:41:35.389 --> 03:41:35.399 align:start position:0%
funded now oh fully funded well so we
 
03:41:36.830 --> 03:41:36.840 align:start position:0%
work with the we we have Federal
 
03:41:38.790 --> 03:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
resources that come in that we contract
 
03:41:40.510 --> 03:41:40.520 align:start position:0%
with dart meth this would be additional
 
03:41:43.189 --> 03:41:43.199 align:start position:0%
Revenue which would be put toward um
 
03:41:44.550 --> 03:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
injury prevention programs and
 
03:41:44.560 --> 03:41:47.910 align:start position:0%
injury prevention programs and
activities

03:41:47.910 --> 03:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:49.870 --> 03:41:49.880 align:start position:0%
followup yeah thank
 
03:41:51.830 --> 03:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
you could you list some of those
 
03:41:53.309 --> 03:41:53.319 align:start position:0%
activities so I get an idea what you're
 
03:41:54.830 --> 03:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
trying to use the money
 
03:41:57.309 --> 03:41:57.319 align:start position:0%
for sure I can ask Senator Apprentice to
 
03:41:59.189 --> 03:41:59.199 align:start position:0%
join me
 
03:42:03.429 --> 03:42:03.439 align:start position:0%
may I have a I have a list here
 
03:42:06.710 --> 03:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
um so and this would be to expand they
 
03:42:08.189 --> 03:42:08.199 align:start position:0%
are limited on the programs that they
 
03:42:10.149 --> 03:42:10.159 align:start position:0%
can deliver because there's only so much
 
03:42:11.710 --> 03:42:11.720 align:start position:0%
money that comes through these Grant
 
03:42:14.429 --> 03:42:14.439 align:start position:0%
programs that is available so helmet and
 
03:42:17.070 --> 03:42:17.080 align:start position:0%
bike and pedest and safety program stop
 
03:42:19.670 --> 03:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
the bleed programs bicycle lights which
 
03:42:22.110 --> 03:42:22.120 align:start position:0%
is also a you know bicycle safety
 
03:42:24.910 --> 03:42:24.920 align:start position:0%
program for children um it would support
 
03:42:26.870 --> 03:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
safe kit so there's Safe kitss program
 
03:42:29.349 --> 03:42:29.359 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire which does work again
 
03:42:32.030 --> 03:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
around motor vehicles around bicycles
 
03:42:34.309 --> 03:42:34.319 align:start position:0%
and around pedestrian related activities
 
03:42:37.309 --> 03:42:37.319 align:start position:0%
there's a life jacket loner program that
 
03:42:40.149 --> 03:42:40.159 align:start position:0%
right now 21 communities have adopted
 
03:42:41.510 --> 03:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
but they could expand the number of
 
03:42:43.670 --> 03:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
communities to prevent drowning by
 
03:42:45.910 --> 03:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
having these looners available so they
 
03:42:49.469 --> 03:42:49.479 align:start position:0%
have them in 200 they only have 207 that
 
03:42:51.630 --> 03:42:51.640 align:start position:0%
are loaned out to these 21 communities
 
03:42:53.510 --> 03:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
that could be expanded the youth
 
03:42:57.149 --> 03:42:57.159 align:start position:0%
operator program contracted by The
 
03:43:00.269 --> 03:43:00.279 align:start position:0%
Matrix save the life tour that sponsors
 
03:43:02.670 --> 03:43:02.680 align:start position:0%
simulation events in high schools really
 
03:43:04.510 --> 03:43:04.520 align:start position:0%
around thinking fast when operating
 
03:43:06.910 --> 03:43:06.920 align:start position:0%
motor vehicles and enhancing the
 
03:43:08.590 --> 03:43:08.600 align:start position:0%
continued work of the child passenger
 
03:43:10.510 --> 03:43:10.520 align:start position:0%
safety program so making sure that the
 
03:43:14.670 --> 03:43:14.680 align:start position:0%
child seats that we the child seats that
 
03:43:14.680 --> 03:43:15.670 align:start position:0%
child seats that we the child seats that
infants

03:43:15.670 --> 03:43:15.680 align:start position:0%
infants
 
03:43:17.550 --> 03:43:17.560 align:start position:0%
toddlers are put in are installed
 
03:43:19.670 --> 03:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
correctly by training the technicians
 
03:43:21.710 --> 03:43:21.720 align:start position:0%
and often times we see that um not just
 
03:43:23.309 --> 03:43:23.319 align:start position:0%
out see them at local fire departments
 
03:43:24.910 --> 03:43:24.920 align:start position:0%
will become trained to do this so they
 
03:43:26.149 --> 03:43:26.159 align:start position:0%
can do it in their communities but we
 
03:43:28.910 --> 03:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
see nurses and folks that work at Birth
 
03:43:30.309 --> 03:43:30.319 align:start position:0%
at maternity units of birth and Care
 
03:43:32.750 --> 03:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
Centers so those are just some of the
 
03:43:35.870 --> 03:43:35.880 align:start position:0%
programs uh that are have limited
 
03:43:37.790 --> 03:43:37.800 align:start position:0%
funding but are doing a great job right
 
03:43:39.590 --> 03:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
now we could actually help them by
 
03:43:42.870 --> 03:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:44.830 --> 03:43:44.840 align:start position:0%
available any other questions for the
 
03:43:47.910 --> 03:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
Comm representative pemon thank you Mr
 
03:43:51.870 --> 03:43:51.880 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you to both of you um if
 
03:43:54.229 --> 03:43:54.239 align:start position:0%
this reference is black grant money so
 
03:43:55.910 --> 03:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
how were these funds applied for are
 
03:43:58.910 --> 03:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
they applied uh by municipalities for
 
03:44:01.110 --> 03:44:01.120 align:start position:0%
these funds or through medical
 
03:44:03.070 --> 03:44:03.080 align:start position:0%
facilities how are they allocated uh
 
03:44:04.510 --> 03:44:04.520 align:start position:0%
sure so our block grant is something
 
03:44:05.990 --> 03:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
that it's a federal block grant and the
 
03:44:08.469 --> 03:44:08.479 align:start position:0%
department submits um you know
 
03:44:10.309 --> 03:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
information through Grant applications
 
03:44:11.630 --> 03:44:11.640 align:start position:0%
to receive the funds to the federal
 
03:44:13.030 --> 03:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
government based on our priorities and
 
03:44:14.630 --> 03:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
what we see a need is here in New
 
03:44:17.550 --> 03:44:17.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for those funds okay how if I
 
03:44:20.030 --> 03:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
could continue follow up how are they uh
 
03:44:21.750 --> 03:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
allocated throughout New Hampshire
 
03:44:23.830 --> 03:44:23.840 align:start position:0%
specifically who is it the
 
03:44:25.710 --> 03:44:25.720 align:start position:0%
municipalities that would reach out to
 
03:44:28.870 --> 03:44:28.880 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth to say we've got a lifesaver
 
03:44:31.110 --> 03:44:31.120 align:start position:0%
program or life jacket program for
 
03:44:33.149 --> 03:44:33.159 align:start position:0%
rental how how are they allocated right
 
03:44:34.550 --> 03:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
so the department receives money from
 
03:44:35.870 --> 03:44:35.880 align:start position:0%
the federal government for injury
 
03:44:37.070 --> 03:44:37.080 align:start position:0%
prevention and the department would
 
03:44:38.750 --> 03:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
allocate some of those Grant funds based
 
03:44:41.149 --> 03:44:41.159 align:start position:0%
on needs in the community and those and
 
03:44:42.550 --> 03:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
those programs that are that are
 
03:44:45.670 --> 03:44:45.680 align:start position:0%
identified as needing funds
 
03:44:48.469 --> 03:44:48.479 align:start position:0%
okay I'm just trying to get an answer
 
03:44:51.030 --> 03:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
additional follow so in other words if I
 
03:44:53.349 --> 03:44:53.359 align:start position:0%
understand you correctly the M the
 
03:44:55.510 --> 03:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities would be let say the city
 
03:44:58.469 --> 03:44:58.479 align:start position:0%
of nashor would reach out to you they
 
03:45:00.070 --> 03:45:00.080 align:start position:0%
could and that that's and then they
 
03:45:01.910 --> 03:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
would be allocated Accord to there and
 
03:45:03.469 --> 03:45:03.479 align:start position:0%
then I don't know if that the senator
 
03:45:05.630 --> 03:45:05.640 align:start position:0%
knows that the question that was asked
 
03:45:08.469 --> 03:45:08.479 align:start position:0%
earlier about the fiscal impact of the
 
03:45:12.590 --> 03:45:12.600 align:start position:0%
$10,000 where that's coming from
 
03:45:15.550 --> 03:45:15.560 align:start position:0%
so how of Senate Finance we pass
 
03:45:17.510 --> 03:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
and there was no fiscal note there was a
 
03:45:20.750 --> 03:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
discussion of $10,000 but then there was
 
03:45:22.229 --> 03:45:22.239 align:start position:0%
discussion about there being no fiscal
 
03:45:23.950 --> 03:45:23.960 align:start position:0%
note I believe that that would I'd have
 
03:45:27.309 --> 03:45:27.319 align:start position:0%
to turn to director morasco on that okay
 
03:45:29.349 --> 03:45:29.359 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr and he has he has
 
03:45:30.830 --> 03:45:30.840 align:start position:0%
he'll be coming up to testify in a
 
03:45:32.990 --> 03:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
moment thank you I had an additional
 
03:45:35.070 --> 03:45:35.080 align:start position:0%
comment if I could so um Senator
 
03:45:36.670 --> 03:45:36.680 align:start position:0%
Apprentice mentioned the life jacket
 
03:45:38.830 --> 03:45:38.840 align:start position:0%
laner stations that would be available
 
03:45:40.510 --> 03:45:40.520 align:start position:0%
to be funded through this and I do want
 
03:45:41.990 --> 03:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
to make the commit do want to make the
 
03:45:43.309 --> 03:45:43.319 align:start position:0%
committee aware that there was a life
 
03:45:45.630 --> 03:45:45.640 align:start position:0%
jaer laner bill that was heard in
 
03:45:47.830 --> 03:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
Recreation and resources to set up a
 
03:45:49.710 --> 03:45:49.720 align:start position:0%
life jacket loader station along the
 
03:45:51.389 --> 03:45:51.399 align:start position:0%
marac River due to the increased amount
 
03:45:54.990 --> 03:45:55.000 align:start position:0%
of drownings um that bill was not found
 
03:45:57.429 --> 03:45:57.439 align:start position:0%
uh would did not pass due to logistical
 
03:45:59.070 --> 03:45:59.080 align:start position:0%
issues but just did want to share that
 
03:46:01.830 --> 03:46:01.840 align:start position:0%
that was life jackets and drownings were
 
03:46:03.590 --> 03:46:03.600 align:start position:0%
um specifically mentioned in the child
 
03:46:05.950 --> 03:46:05.960 align:start position:0%
fatality review report that the
 
03:46:07.870 --> 03:46:07.880 align:start position:0%
department does on child like untimely
 
03:46:10.590 --> 03:46:10.600 align:start position:0%
child deaths and so this is a priority
 
03:46:12.389 --> 03:46:12.399 align:start position:0%
uh that this funds would go to some like
 
03:46:14.110 --> 03:46:14.120 align:start position:0%
something like that which is identified
 
03:46:15.750 --> 03:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
as an issue so so just wanted to share
 
03:46:17.269 --> 03:46:17.279 align:start position:0%

03:47:44.229 --> 03:47:44.239 align:start position:0%
she was trying to do with the bill and
 
03:47:46.990 --> 03:47:47.000 align:start position:0%
uh for the injury pres prevention center
 
03:47:49.790 --> 03:47:49.800 align:start position:0%
um and as far as the fiscal portion of
 
03:47:52.189 --> 03:47:52.199 align:start position:0%
it goes so uh as far as the DMV is
 
03:47:54.469 --> 03:47:54.479 align:start position:0%
concerned it's it's $8 for a pair of
 
03:47:57.550 --> 03:47:57.560 align:start position:0%
plates um that's what our role is when a
 
03:48:00.189 --> 03:48:00.199 align:start position:0%
decal is created and it comes to the DMV
 
03:48:02.389 --> 03:48:02.399 align:start position:0%
after approved by the legislature uh we
 
03:48:05.110 --> 03:48:05.120 align:start position:0%
do look at the decal U to make sure that
 
03:48:08.389 --> 03:48:08.399 align:start position:0%
the reflectivity is appropriate um that
 
03:48:10.750 --> 03:48:10.760 align:start position:0%
the sizing is correct um but as far as
 
03:48:12.870 --> 03:48:12.880 align:start position:0%
what that decal is going to look like um
 
03:48:14.110 --> 03:48:14.120 align:start position:0%
that's something that the nonprofit
 
03:48:15.950 --> 03:48:15.960 align:start position:0%
would work on and then deliver it to us
 
03:48:18.070 --> 03:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
so that's our role in it our role is
 
03:48:19.149 --> 03:48:19.159 align:start position:0%
really to
 
03:48:22.469 --> 03:48:22.479 align:start position:0%
produce this um with a perforated box
 
03:48:24.189 --> 03:48:24.199 align:start position:0%
here for where the legislatively
 
03:48:27.469 --> 03:48:27.479 align:start position:0%
approved decal will go um and just to uh
 
03:48:28.750 --> 03:48:28.760 align:start position:0%
look at the decals before they're
 
03:48:30.349 --> 03:48:30.359 align:start position:0%
actually put into motion by the
 
03:48:33.429 --> 03:48:33.439 align:start position:0%
nonprofit so for us there's no fiscal
 
03:48:34.790 --> 03:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
impact we produce these plates we're
 
03:48:36.229 --> 03:48:36.239 align:start position:0%
going to continue to produce them with
 
03:48:38.269 --> 03:48:38.279 align:start position:0%
the perforated box and it's up to the
 
03:48:41.229 --> 03:48:41.239 align:start position:0%
nonprofit to come up with the the decal
 
03:48:43.389 --> 03:48:43.399 align:start position:0%
make sure that it meets the proper specs
 
03:48:44.870 --> 03:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
and then the money that goes back into
 
03:48:47.309 --> 03:48:47.319 align:start position:0%
forth um to issue the decal and the
 
03:48:49.149 --> 03:48:49.159 align:start position:0%
money that comes in um through the
 
03:48:52.110 --> 03:48:52.120 align:start position:0%
consumer we don't get involved with that
 
03:48:54.550 --> 03:48:54.560 align:start position:0%
part thank you any questions from the
 
03:48:56.870 --> 03:48:56.880 align:start position:0%

stclair thank you Mr chair and thank you

than $10,000 so the $10,000 I'm trying
 
03:49:08.990 --> 03:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
to get an answer on I don't know exactly
 
03:49:12.229 --> 03:49:12.239 align:start position:0%
how the $110,000 fits in with the DMV I
 
03:49:14.349 --> 03:49:14.359 align:start position:0%
from supervisors and registration it's
 
03:49:16.830 --> 03:49:16.840 align:start position:0%
the $8 to produce the plate that the
 
03:49:18.429 --> 03:49:18.439 align:start position:0%
prison already produces for us with the
 
03:49:20.510 --> 03:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
perforated box so I'm not quite sure
 
03:49:22.950 --> 03:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
where the 8ou the $10,000 comes in I
 
03:49:26.550 --> 03:49:26.560 align:start position:0%

uh for being late I was in the wrong
 
03:50:20.149 --> 03:50:20.159 align:start position:0%
location I'm Angela Duke I'm the manager
 
03:50:22.189 --> 03:50:22.199 align:start position:0%
of the injury prevention center at
 
03:50:24.950 --> 03:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth health located in Lebanon and
 
03:50:26.710 --> 03:50:26.720 align:start position:0%
I understand that Senator Apprentice had
 
03:50:28.590 --> 03:50:28.600 align:start position:0%
already given testimony so I definitely
 
03:50:31.990 --> 03:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
don't need five minutes um but I'm here
 
03:50:35.590 --> 03:50:35.600 align:start position:0%
just in support of SB um
 
03:50:38.590 --> 03:50:38.600 align:start position:0%
467 and available to answer any
 
03:50:41.469 --> 03:50:41.479 align:start position:0%
questions this uh additional funding
 
03:50:43.469 --> 03:50:43.479 align:start position:0%
from the license plate would definitely
 
03:50:45.990 --> 03:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
supplement and and allow us to expand
 
03:50:49.750 --> 03:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
our programs currently we have um
 
03:50:52.110 --> 03:50:52.120 align:start position:0%
reduced funding this particular fiscal
 
03:50:54.670 --> 03:50:54.680 align:start position:0%
year for our community programs so for
 
03:50:57.110 --> 03:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
example we've been able to
 
03:51:00.830 --> 03:51:00.840 align:start position:0%
um in the last couple of years fund 40
 
03:51:03.550 --> 03:51:03.560 align:start position:0%
to 60 New Hampshire communities with
 
03:51:05.590 --> 03:51:05.600 align:start position:0%
bike helmets and bike and pedestrian
 
03:51:07.389 --> 03:51:07.399 align:start position:0%
pedestrian safety information
 
03:51:09.790 --> 03:51:09.800 align:start position:0%
information and education um
 
03:51:12.070 --> 03:51:12.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunately this year with reduced
 
03:51:14.030 --> 03:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
funding with some supplemental from
 
03:51:15.229 --> 03:51:15.239 align:start position:0%
dmouth Heth
 
03:51:17.229 --> 03:51:17.239 align:start position:0%
we're now down to just um being able to
 
03:51:20.550 --> 03:51:20.560 align:start position:0%
award 30 communities so this would allow
 
03:51:23.070 --> 03:51:23.080 align:start position:0%
us to uh continue to grow that program
 
03:51:25.630 --> 03:51:25.640 align:start position:0%
and we do prioritize new communities and
 
03:51:28.189 --> 03:51:28.199 align:start position:0%
try to honor um previously awarded
 
03:51:30.189 --> 03:51:30.199 align:start position:0%
communities as much as possible and the
 
03:51:33.149 --> 03:51:33.159 align:start position:0%
bik helments go along with um not just
 
03:51:36.510 --> 03:51:36.520 align:start position:0%
the education but um municipalities
 
03:51:39.429 --> 03:51:39.439 align:start position:0%
police departments other Town um
 
03:51:43.110 --> 03:51:43.120 align:start position:0%
organizations will uh set up bike rodeos
 
03:51:45.309 --> 03:51:45.319 align:start position:0%
um where they will hand out disseminate
 
03:51:47.550 --> 03:51:47.560 align:start position:0%
the the helmets and the information and
 
03:51:49.950 --> 03:51:49.960 align:start position:0%
they do helmet fitting so it really is a
 
03:51:52.830 --> 03:51:52.840 align:start position:0%
pretty expansive opportunity um we have
 
03:51:55.429 --> 03:51:55.439 align:start position:0%
recently been able to address the life
 
03:51:58.030 --> 03:51:58.040 align:start position:0%
jacket laner program um and each year we
 
03:51:59.469 --> 03:51:59.479 align:start position:0%
try to increase the number of
 
03:52:02.229 --> 03:52:02.239 align:start position:0%
communities served um there was an
 
03:52:04.630 --> 03:52:04.640 align:start position:0%
increase in drownings last year and so
 
03:52:06.349 --> 03:52:06.359 align:start position:0%
we are trying to increase our life
 
03:52:08.790 --> 03:52:08.800 align:start position:0%
jacket loaner program this year we'll be
 
03:52:11.990 --> 03:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
able to fund um 20 additional
 
03:52:14.070 --> 03:52:14.080 align:start position:0%
communities but we're not sure where the
 
03:52:15.590 --> 03:52:15.600 align:start position:0%
funding will will come from for the next
 
03:52:17.429 --> 03:52:17.439 align:start position:0%
couple of years so this is an
 
03:52:20.950 --> 03:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity to ensure that we can um
 
03:52:22.790 --> 03:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
continue these really important programs
 
03:52:27.229 --> 03:52:27.239 align:start position:0%
and continue to reduce injury across the
 
03:52:30.710 --> 03:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
state thank you any questions from the
 
03:52:32.910 --> 03:52:32.920 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
03:52:35.670 --> 03:52:35.680 align:start position:0%
Fox thank you Mr chairman who do you
 
03:52:38.870 --> 03:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
anticipate would purchase these decal
 
03:52:41.229 --> 03:52:41.239 align:start position:0%
and and how much do you
 
03:52:46.070 --> 03:52:46.080 align:start position:0%
anticipate um um you will you will
 
03:52:49.510 --> 03:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
benefit um we have a pretty vast
 
03:52:53.630 --> 03:52:53.640 align:start position:0%
Statewide network of um both um
 
03:52:56.870 --> 03:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
nonprofit organizations but um education
 
03:52:58.550 --> 03:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
we know we have some stakeholders that
 
03:53:00.830 --> 03:53:00.840 align:start position:0%
would definitely invest in this so we
 
03:53:03.030 --> 03:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
trust um that would go far and wide
 
03:53:04.550 --> 03:53:04.560 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of injury prevention
 
03:53:07.750 --> 03:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
Professionals in the state um and
 
03:53:09.630 --> 03:53:09.640 align:start position:0%
whether they are state funded or not I
 
03:53:10.910 --> 03:53:10.920 align:start position:0%
think that they would be willing to
 
03:53:12.429 --> 03:53:12.439 align:start position:0%
support this and help share this with
 
03:53:15.070 --> 03:53:15.080 align:start position:0%
their networks we do a lot of work in
 
03:53:16.590 --> 03:53:16.600 align:start position:0%
many different areas of injury
 
03:53:17.910 --> 03:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
prevention so we have pretty strong
 
03:53:21.830 --> 03:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
stakeholder list um I'm not sure how
 
03:53:23.229 --> 03:53:23.239 align:start position:0%
much this would bring in this is a
 
03:53:25.670 --> 03:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
program that's completely new to me I
 
03:53:28.070 --> 03:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
don't know if Senator Apprentice has um
 
03:53:31.189 --> 03:53:31.199 align:start position:0%
additional information on that so follow
 
03:53:34.550 --> 03:53:34.560 align:start position:0%
up follow up please and I'm not sure if
 
03:53:37.229 --> 03:53:37.239 align:start position:0%
addressing the question to you how much
 
03:53:39.790 --> 03:53:39.800 align:start position:0%
um how much will you charge for the
 
03:53:43.910 --> 03:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
decal or how much is do the other
 
03:53:46.269 --> 03:53:46.279 align:start position:0%
organiz ation
 
03:53:49.110 --> 03:53:49.120 align:start position:0%
charge I'm not
 
03:53:52.630 --> 03:53:52.640 align:start position:0%
sure I can speak I I imagine that um or
 
03:53:54.870 --> 03:53:54.880 align:start position:0%
a trust that U representative sellers
 
03:53:56.710 --> 03:53:56.720 align:start position:0%

03:54:01.830 --> 03:54:01.840 align:start position:0%
donation okay so would it be okay if
 
03:54:04.189 --> 03:54:04.199 align:start position:0%

decal plate and they charge $30 on top
 
03:54:23.070 --> 03:54:23.080 align:start position:0%

03:54:51.229 --> 03:54:51.239 align:start position:0%
the federal block grant monies are what
 
03:54:53.590 --> 03:54:53.600 align:start position:0%
have you you've been relying on lately
 
03:54:55.990 --> 03:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh in my experience uh Federal block
 
03:54:59.070 --> 03:54:59.080 align:start position:0%
grants are not guaranteed funds um if my
 
03:55:00.950 --> 03:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
first question if I may ask have you
 
03:55:03.229 --> 03:55:03.239 align:start position:0%
noticed a downward Trend in the federal
 
03:55:06.910 --> 03:55:06.920 align:start position:0%
assistance yes so we do um have
 
03:55:08.830 --> 03:55:08.840 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Health dollars as well that
 
03:55:10.389 --> 03:55:10.399 align:start position:0%
but the majority of our Dartmouth Health
 
03:55:12.590 --> 03:55:12.600 align:start position:0%
dollars are serving the injury
 
03:55:14.030 --> 03:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
prevention needs of our providers and
 
03:55:16.309 --> 03:55:16.319 align:start position:0%
patient patients um although we do have
 
03:55:18.550 --> 03:55:18.560 align:start position:0%
some monies that allow us to support our
 
03:55:20.670 --> 03:55:20.680 align:start position:0%
some of our community based programs so
 
03:55:23.590 --> 03:55:23.600 align:start position:0%
we have relied more heavily on the state
 
03:55:25.550 --> 03:55:25.560 align:start position:0%
block grant dollars to help support the
 
03:55:28.189 --> 03:55:28.199 align:start position:0%
community based programs and yes I would
 
03:55:31.269 --> 03:55:31.279 align:start position:0%
say that we have seen a a downward Trend
 
03:55:34.670 --> 03:55:34.680 align:start position:0%
so we're probably uh losing about 30,000
 
03:55:36.950 --> 03:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
on average a year for our community-
 
03:55:40.710 --> 03:55:40.720 align:start position:0%
based programs thank followup followup
 
03:55:45.149 --> 03:55:45.159 align:start position:0%
so in other words uh uh if this passes
 
03:55:47.590 --> 03:55:47.600 align:start position:0%
this would be of of not just
 
03:55:49.910 --> 03:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
supplemental monies but really needed
 
03:55:51.710 --> 03:55:51.720 align:start position:0%
Monies to continue the program am I
 
03:55:54.349 --> 03:55:54.359 align:start position:0%
correct yes correct I mean as we as we
 
03:55:56.070 --> 03:55:56.080 align:start position:0%
know block grant dollars are not
 
03:55:57.830 --> 03:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
guaranteed so they're always a little
 
03:56:01.710 --> 03:56:01.720 align:start position:0%
bit um variable anyway so this would be
 
03:56:04.950 --> 03:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
definitely a more stable funding stream
 
03:56:08.750 --> 03:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
one more followup one more followup um
 
03:56:11.469 --> 03:56:11.479 align:start position:0%
should this pass how do you plan on
 
03:56:13.630 --> 03:56:13.640 align:start position:0%
getting the communications out to the
 
03:56:15.910 --> 03:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
municipality within New Hampshire yeah
 
03:56:17.950 --> 03:56:17.960 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned before we have a strong
 
03:56:20.229 --> 03:56:20.239 align:start position:0%
Communications with our um all of our
 
03:56:22.950 --> 03:56:22.960 align:start position:0%
stakeholders we also utilize um our
 
03:56:24.710 --> 03:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
state departments so the New Hampshire
 
03:56:26.550 --> 03:56:26.560 align:start position:0%

03:56:31.670 --> 03:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
information we also utilize Dartmouth
 
03:56:34.189 --> 03:56:34.199 align:start position:0%
Health Communications and marketing team
 
03:56:36.469 --> 03:56:36.479 align:start position:0%
um to help us with with this kind of
 
03:56:37.910 --> 03:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
effort as
 
03:56:40.510 --> 03:56:40.520 align:start position:0%

about Senate Bill 465 relative to
 
03:59:08.070 --> 03:59:08.080 align:start position:0%

emergency vehicles involving a disabled
 
03:59:12.670 --> 03:59:12.680 align:start position:0%
vehicle the current Move Over law in New
 
03:59:14.710 --> 03:59:14.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire applies to vehicles displaying
 
03:59:17.510 --> 03:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
red blue Amber emergency or warning
 
03:59:20.030 --> 03:59:20.040 align:start position:0%
lights but cable 465 will expand this
 
03:59:23.030 --> 03:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
law to cover disabled Vehicles as well
 
03:59:24.590 --> 03:59:24.600 align:start position:0%
this Bill calls for action for motorists
 
03:59:26.269 --> 03:59:26.279 align:start position:0%
When approaching a disabled vehicle
 
03:59:28.189 --> 03:59:28.199 align:start position:0%
along the roadside and adds the term
 
03:59:29.670 --> 03:59:29.680 align:start position:0%
disabled vehicle and provides a
 
03:59:32.910 --> 03:59:32.920 align:start position:0%
definition to RSA 265
 
03:59:35.550 --> 03:59:35.560 align:start position:0%
37a this bill requires vehicle operators
 
03:59:37.510 --> 03:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
with due consideration to safety and
 
03:59:39.910 --> 03:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
traffic conditions to move over safely
 
03:59:41.990 --> 03:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
if impossible or unsafe vehicle
 
03:59:44.149 --> 03:59:44.159 align:start position:0%
operators may pass a disabled vehicle at
 
03:59:46.750 --> 03:59:46.760 align:start position:0%

and killed each year uh while outside
 
03:59:54.750 --> 03:59:54.760 align:start position:0%
their vehicle currently 20 states have
 
03:59:57.189 --> 03:59:57.199 align:start position:0%
similar laws uh simil uh the New

Hampshire committee the National
 
04:00:00.990 --> 04:00:01.000 align:start position:0%
Committee on traffic laws and ordinances
 
04:00:02.630 --> 04:00:02.640 align:start position:0%

Council of state legislators at the
 
04:00:08.149 --> 04:00:08.159 align:start position:0%
mouthful I apologize published the
 
04:00:10.510 --> 04:00:10.520 align:start position:0%
incident responders safety model law
 
04:00:12.870 --> 04:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
this model this model law removed
 
04:00:14.590 --> 04:00:14.600 align:start position:0%
language regarding specific vehicles to
 
04:00:16.710 --> 04:00:16.720 align:start position:0%
include all vehicles and people When
 
04:00:18.870 --> 04:00:18.880 align:start position:0%
approaching a roadside incident
 
04:00:21.349 --> 04:00:21.359 align:start position:0%
similarly the intent of Senate Bill 465
 
04:00:23.550 --> 04:00:23.560 align:start position:0%
is to standardize the necessary practice
 
04:00:25.309 --> 04:00:25.319 align:start position:0%
of slowing down and moving over for all
 
04:00:27.189 --> 04:00:27.199 align:start position:0%
vehicles that are on the roadside both
 
04:00:29.429 --> 04:00:29.439 align:start position:0%
working and disabled and with that I am
 
04:00:30.910 --> 04:00:30.920 align:start position:0%
happy to take any
 
04:00:32.910 --> 04:00:32.920 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Senator any
 
04:00:35.550 --> 04:00:35.560 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
04:00:38.790 --> 04:00:38.800 align:start position:0%
committee representative Hill yes I just
 
04:00:40.189 --> 04:00:40.199 align:start position:0%
wanted to thank the senator for
 
04:00:41.790 --> 04:00:41.800 align:start position:0%
providing a role model for we
 
04:00:43.630 --> 04:00:43.640 align:start position:0%
Transportation people yeah it's only up
 
04:00:45.229 --> 04:00:45.239 align:start position:0%
from here
 
04:00:48.630 --> 04:00:48.640 align:start position:0%
guys um I just want I do have a question
 
04:00:51.070 --> 04:00:51.080 align:start position:0%
about um
 
04:00:55.189 --> 04:00:55.199 align:start position:0%
um how would this be enforced um if a if
 
04:00:57.630 --> 04:00:57.640 align:start position:0%
a vehicle is by the side of the road and
 
04:01:00.550 --> 04:01:00.560 align:start position:0%
it's um unclear to the person
 
04:01:03.349 --> 04:01:03.359 align:start position:0%
approaching whether it's disabled or not
 
04:01:04.590 --> 04:01:04.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely and we thank you for the
 
04:01:06.309 --> 04:01:06.319 align:start position:0%
question representative we had those
 
04:01:08.149 --> 04:01:08.159 align:start position:0%
discussions you know what is a disabled
 
04:01:09.910 --> 04:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
vehicle and so we came to the conclusion
 
04:01:11.269 --> 04:01:11.279 align:start position:0%
that essentially any car on the side of
 
04:01:13.389 --> 04:01:13.399 align:start position:0%
the road could be considered uh disabled
 
04:01:14.590 --> 04:01:14.600 align:start position:0%
and is there anyone with a badge behind
 
04:01:15.950 --> 04:01:15.960 align:start position:0%
there's a couple guys with badges behind
 
04:01:18.229 --> 04:01:18.239 align:start position:0%
me so they could probably tell you how
 
04:01:20.510 --> 04:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
they're going to enforce it but you know
 
04:01:21.910 --> 04:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
I think the reality is that you know
 
04:01:23.229 --> 04:01:23.239 align:start position:0%
we're not necessarily looking to punish
 
04:01:24.510 --> 04:01:24.520 align:start position:0%
people we're looking for people to be
 
04:01:26.710 --> 04:01:26.720 align:start position:0%
safe and um you know a young gentleman
 
04:01:28.870 --> 04:01:28.880 align:start position:0%
was struck and killed recently a 24 year
 
04:01:30.710 --> 04:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
old um because he was just changing his
 
04:01:32.870 --> 04:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
tire and I think if we all know that we
 
04:01:34.870 --> 04:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
have to move over for any vehicle on the
 
04:01:36.349 --> 04:01:36.359 align:start position:0%
side of the road I think that would um
 
04:01:37.870 --> 04:01:37.880 align:start position:0%
save a lot of
 
04:01:40.349 --> 04:01:40.359 align:start position:0%
casualties thanks yeah any other
 
04:01:41.189 --> 04:01:41.199 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
04:01:41.199 --> 04:01:42.830 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
representative

04:01:42.830 --> 04:01:42.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:01:42.840 --> 04:01:51.189 align:start position:0%
representative
plemon

04:01:51.189 --> 04:01:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:54.710 --> 04:01:54.720 align:start position:0%
claric flashing light from a vehicle
 
04:01:56.630 --> 04:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
instead of you know the red blue and
 
04:01:59.710 --> 04:01:59.720 align:start position:0%
Amber emergency vehicle when it stated
 
04:02:01.870 --> 04:02:01.880 align:start position:0%
warning lights is that the intention
 
04:02:04.070 --> 04:02:04.080 align:start position:0%
here representative thank you for the
 
04:02:05.710 --> 04:02:05.720 align:start position:0%
question I don't have a full description
 
04:02:08.149 --> 04:02:08.159 align:start position:0%
on what warning lights are um these
 
04:02:10.510 --> 04:02:10.520 align:start position:0%
gentlemen might I hope I keep relying on
 
04:02:12.630 --> 04:02:12.640 align:start position:0%
them but I think it's um you know only
 
04:02:14.590 --> 04:02:14.600 align:start position:0%
certain individuals organizations are
 
04:02:16.189 --> 04:02:16.199 align:start position:0%
allowed to have warning lights on their
 
04:02:19.149 --> 04:02:19.159 align:start position:0%
vehicle could be a snowplow uh tow truck
 
04:02:20.510 --> 04:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
which mostly is Amber lights or it could
 
04:02:22.149 --> 04:02:22.159 align:start position:0%
be those bright white lights they're on
 
04:02:23.469 --> 04:02:23.479 align:start position:0%
the back of Troopers
 
04:02:25.950 --> 04:02:25.960 align:start position:0%
Vehicles representative we do have New
 
04:02:27.429 --> 04:02:27.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Police who will be
 
04:02:32.070 --> 04:02:32.080 align:start position:0%
testifying as well um as well okay any
 
04:02:33.070 --> 04:02:33.080 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee
 
04:02:35.429 --> 04:02:35.439 align:start position:0%
representative Rambo it's sort of a
 
04:02:37.269 --> 04:02:37.279 align:start position:0%
question comment prior to comments and
 
04:02:38.670 --> 04:02:38.680 align:start position:0%
maybe we'll get clarified by the next
 
04:02:40.469 --> 04:02:40.479 align:start position:0%
point the language we suggests don't
 
04:02:41.870 --> 04:02:41.880 align:start position:0%
need any of those lights any stopped or
 
04:02:43.590 --> 04:02:43.600 align:start position:0%
standing vehicle would be reason to give
 
04:02:47.550 --> 04:02:47.560 align:start position:0%
birth so b rth um so it would not be
 
04:02:49.429 --> 04:02:49.439 align:start position:0%
necessarily contingent on any of the the
 
04:02:50.750 --> 04:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
warning lights or whether the vehicle's
 
04:02:52.710 --> 04:02:52.720 align:start position:0%
disabled for based on this language
 
04:02:54.870 --> 04:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
correct and that's correct I think um
 
04:02:56.389 --> 04:02:56.399 align:start position:0%
you know I think we still want that
 
04:02:57.870 --> 04:02:57.880 align:start position:0%
language in there just so people
 
04:02:59.469 --> 04:02:59.479 align:start position:0%
understand like you still have to move
 
04:03:01.670 --> 04:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
over for everything it's not exclusive
 
04:03:01.680 --> 04:03:02.870 align:start position:0%
over for everything it's not exclusive
other

04:03:02.870 --> 04:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:03:04.790 --> 04:03:04.800 align:start position:0%
correct any other questions from the
 
04:03:07.510 --> 04:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
committee representative sellers thank
 
04:03:10.990 --> 04:03:11.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um so going down a double
 
04:03:13.790 --> 04:03:13.800 align:start position:0%
lane Highway here do I have to move over
 
04:03:16.229 --> 04:03:16.239 align:start position:0%
to the highp speed lane from the slow so
 
04:03:18.510 --> 04:03:18.520 align:start position:0%
away from the breakdown Lane is that
 
04:03:20.269 --> 04:03:20.279 align:start position:0%
what you're envisioning as well I
 
04:03:21.550 --> 04:03:21.560 align:start position:0%
appreciate the question representative
 
04:03:23.990 --> 04:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
it's um what you can do safely you know
 
04:03:25.149 --> 04:03:25.159 align:start position:0%
we're not looking to cause another
 
04:03:26.710 --> 04:03:26.720 align:start position:0%
accident it's um you know if you can't
 
04:03:28.710 --> 04:03:28.720 align:start position:0%
move over you can't move over and you're
 
04:03:31.070 --> 04:03:31.080 align:start position:0%
not going to get penalized for
 
04:03:33.670 --> 04:03:33.680 align:start position:0%
that any other questions from the
 
04:03:35.830 --> 04:03:35.840 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any thank you
 
04:03:39.110 --> 04:03:39.120 align:start position:0%
Senator thank you very much with that
 
04:03:41.950 --> 04:03:41.960 align:start position:0%
the chair I like to recognize
 
04:03:45.389 --> 04:03:45.399 align:start position:0%
Matthew matio hopefully I said said that
 
04:03:48.030 --> 04:03:48.040 align:start position:0%
right from New Hampshire State Police
 
04:03:50.189 --> 04:03:50.199 align:start position:0%
who supports the bill uh who's looking
 
04:03:53.030 --> 04:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
for one minute welcome
 
04:03:55.469 --> 04:03:55.479 align:start position:0%
sir thank you
 
04:03:58.469 --> 04:03:58.479 align:start position:0%
sir yes my name is Matthew Uchi and I'm
 
04:03:59.710 --> 04:03:59.720 align:start position:0%
a captain with the New Hampshire State
 
04:04:03.030 --> 04:04:03.040 align:start position:0%
Police uh we are in support of this bill
 
04:04:05.429 --> 04:04:05.439 align:start position:0%
uh the Move Over Law should be expanded
 
04:04:07.030 --> 04:04:07.040 align:start position:0%
to include all vehicles not just
 
04:04:09.950 --> 04:04:09.960 align:start position:0%
emergency vehicles all drivers should be
 
04:04:12.710 --> 04:04:12.720 align:start position:0%
required to move over or slow down to
 
04:04:14.469 --> 04:04:14.479 align:start position:0%
answer your question sir
 
04:04:16.550 --> 04:04:16.560 align:start position:0%
um When approaching any vehicle stopped
 
04:04:18.389 --> 04:04:18.399 align:start position:0%
on the side of the road for any
 
04:04:20.670 --> 04:04:20.680 align:start position:0%
reason uh the expansion would enhance
 
04:04:22.269 --> 04:04:22.279 align:start position:0%
the safety of all individuals including
 
04:04:26.590 --> 04:04:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:29.670 --> 04:04:29.680 align:start position:0%
workers um it would create a culture of
 
04:04:32.710 --> 04:04:32.720 align:start position:0%
Greater awareness
 
04:04:35.950 --> 04:04:35.960 align:start position:0%
uh and reduce the risk of accidents and
 
04:04:38.349 --> 04:04:38.359 align:start position:0%
injuries that's the the objective of
 
04:04:40.670 --> 04:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
this is to create awareness the vast
 
04:04:44.630 --> 04:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
majority of drivers are law abiding
 
04:04:46.750 --> 04:04:46.760 align:start position:0%
citizens this is just to create that
 
04:04:49.790 --> 04:04:49.800 align:start position:0%
awareness um so that when you do see a
 
04:04:52.429 --> 04:04:52.439 align:start position:0%
vehicle that is stopped or parked on the
 
04:04:54.990 --> 04:04:55.000 align:start position:0%
side of the roadway and you have the
 
04:04:57.110 --> 04:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
ability to to slow down and move over
 
04:04:59.710 --> 04:04:59.720 align:start position:0%
you do so safely uh the Move Over Law
 
04:05:01.309 --> 04:05:01.319 align:start position:0%
should be inclusive and protect all
 
04:05:03.229 --> 04:05:03.239 align:start position:0%
individuals who may find themselves on
 
04:05:05.910 --> 04:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
the side of the road for various
 
04:05:08.710 --> 04:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
reasons thank you Sarah any questions
 
04:05:11.590 --> 04:05:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:14.149 --> 04:05:14.159 align:start position:0%
committee representative Hill
 
04:05:15.910 --> 04:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Mr chairman and thank you
 
04:05:19.070 --> 04:05:19.080 align:start position:0%
for taking my question are there any
 
04:05:24.229 --> 04:05:24.239 align:start position:0%
numbers or any in um ideas of incidents
 
04:05:27.110 --> 04:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
I have been on 93 and someone and not
 
04:05:29.229 --> 04:05:29.239 align:start position:0%
known that someone was pulled off to the
 
04:05:32.590 --> 04:05:32.600 align:start position:0%
side but the person in the uh traveling
 
04:05:35.149 --> 04:05:35.159 align:start position:0%
Lane thought it was important for them
 
04:05:38.030 --> 04:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
to move over into my lane and almost
 
04:05:42.910 --> 04:05:42.920 align:start position:0%
sent me into um the southp lane um is
 
04:05:45.469 --> 04:05:45.479 align:start position:0%
there have we noticed any kind of
 
04:05:48.469 --> 04:05:48.479 align:start position:0%
incidents of of accidents due to the
 
04:05:53.070 --> 04:05:53.080 align:start position:0%
Move Over law that uh that um people
 
04:05:57.990 --> 04:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:00.229 --> 04:06:00.239 align:start position:0%
immediately very good question uh I
 
04:06:03.429 --> 04:06:03.439 align:start position:0%
don't have a an answer on okay data or
 
04:06:06.389 --> 04:06:06.399 align:start position:0%
statistics on that um what would be
 
04:06:12.110 --> 04:06:12.120 align:start position:0%
messaged is to to safely slow down first
 
04:06:15.269 --> 04:06:15.279 align:start position:0%
and then move over if if you can um and
 
04:06:17.950 --> 04:06:17.960 align:start position:0%
we want to avoid unintended consequences
 
04:06:21.670 --> 04:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
which on if it's a a two-lane road uh
 
04:06:23.389 --> 04:06:23.399 align:start position:0%
and you have vehicles comeing the other
 
04:06:25.510 --> 04:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
way the assumption would be that they're
 
04:06:27.389 --> 04:06:27.399 align:start position:0%
going to slow down oncoming traffic and
 
04:06:31.070 --> 04:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
move over um it's not always the
 
04:06:34.550 --> 04:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
case thank you any other questions from
 
04:06:37.309 --> 04:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
the committee representative St Clair
 
04:06:40.550 --> 04:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you Captain um
 
04:06:43.309 --> 04:06:43.319 align:start position:0%
I just to follow up on representative
 
04:06:43.319 --> 04:06:44.110 align:start position:0%
I just to follow up on representative
Hill

04:06:44.110 --> 04:06:44.120 align:start position:0%
Hill
 
04:06:46.830 --> 04:06:46.840 align:start position:0%
thing is there some way that uh the
 
04:06:50.830 --> 04:06:50.840 align:start position:0%
state police or somehow to enhance the
 
04:06:54.750 --> 04:06:54.760 align:start position:0%
the term if practical so that we don't
 
04:06:56.630 --> 04:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
have people just say my God it's the law
 
04:07:00.030 --> 04:07:00.040 align:start position:0%
in like that which can happen and does
 
04:07:01.990 --> 04:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
happen quite frankly so do you see any
 
04:07:03.910 --> 04:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
way that we maybe getting the
 
04:07:05.910 --> 04:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
information out to people we can
 
04:07:09.830 --> 04:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:12.269 --> 04:07:12.279 align:start position:0%
practical certainly we can we can work
 
04:07:16.830 --> 04:07:16.840 align:start position:0%
with with do high safety um AAA and work
 
04:07:18.990 --> 04:07:19.000 align:start position:0%
on messaging that's the the biggest
 
04:07:23.950 --> 04:07:23.960 align:start position:0%
thing I I want to say we we enforced
 
04:07:25.950 --> 04:07:25.960 align:start position:0%
approximately three to 400 move over
 
04:07:28.670 --> 04:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
laws last year which a state this size
 
04:07:31.389 --> 04:07:31.399 align:start position:0%
is relatively small um again the
 
04:07:33.670 --> 04:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
objective is to message it out and to
 
04:07:37.309 --> 04:07:37.319 align:start position:0%
get the vast majority of of motorists to
 
04:07:39.149 --> 04:07:39.159 align:start position:0%
see that vehicle that's on the side of
 
04:07:42.510 --> 04:07:42.520 align:start position:0%
the road to slow down first and then if
 
04:07:45.750 --> 04:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
safely they can move over um but a lot
 
04:07:47.670 --> 04:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
of that does come down to messaging
 
04:07:49.950 --> 04:07:49.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much yes sir any other
 
04:07:53.349 --> 04:07:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:56.030 --> 04:07:56.040 align:start position:0%
gagy I realize I'm not thank you Mr
 
04:07:57.630 --> 04:07:57.640 align:start position:0%
chairman I'm not a member of this
 
04:08:01.910 --> 04:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
committee but now but I'm visiting
 
04:08:04.870 --> 04:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
um Captain this is a possible scenario
 
04:08:07.189 --> 04:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
and I've run into this situation before
 
04:08:09.830 --> 04:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
when I could not move over safely I put
 
04:08:11.750 --> 04:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
on I slow down and put on my four-way
 
04:08:14.109 --> 04:08:14.119 align:start position:0%
flashes do we not have four away flashes
 
04:08:15.910 --> 04:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
in all our vehicles today could we not
 
04:08:19.910 --> 04:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
do that to warn people behind us that t
 
04:08:21.630 --> 04:08:21.640 align:start position:0%
to slow
 
04:08:24.389 --> 04:08:24.399 align:start position:0%
down you certainly can and if again if
 
04:08:27.229 --> 04:08:27.239 align:start position:0%
you cannot move over um we're not
 
04:08:29.870 --> 04:08:29.880 align:start position:0%
looking to to conduct a motor vehicle
 
04:08:32.469 --> 04:08:32.479 align:start position:0%
stop on you and summon somebody that's
 
04:08:35.670 --> 04:08:35.680 align:start position:0%
that's trying to be safe um this is to
 
04:08:39.309 --> 04:08:39.319 align:start position:0%
avoid the distracted driver who isn't
 
04:08:41.429 --> 04:08:41.439 align:start position:0%
paying attention for that that moment
 
04:08:43.910 --> 04:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
drifts off the the side of the road and
 
04:08:46.349 --> 04:08:46.359 align:start position:0%
and strikes a a person that's pulled
 
04:08:49.510 --> 04:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
over um parked Stop Standing on the side
 
04:08:50.550 --> 04:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
of the
 
04:08:53.910 --> 04:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
road yes representative plemon thank you
 
04:08:56.550 --> 04:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you Captain um the
 
04:08:58.429 --> 04:08:58.439 align:start position:0%
way this legislation reads to stop their
 
04:09:00.590 --> 04:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
standing vehicle the way I read it is
 
04:09:03.269 --> 04:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
even abandoned vehicles we would be
 
04:09:05.990 --> 04:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
trying to you know move move out of the
 
04:09:08.109 --> 04:09:08.119 align:start position:0%
way I have I've got a concern on that
 
04:09:10.070 --> 04:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
does that is
 
04:09:12.349 --> 04:09:12.359 align:start position:0%
that I don't have where this into
 
04:09:15.030 --> 04:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
question do you feel that that also it
 
04:09:19.070 --> 04:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
would apply with to the current wording
 
04:09:22.510 --> 04:09:22.520 align:start position:0%
um there has been um work on that
 
04:09:25.269 --> 04:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
verbage as far as having uh hazard
 
04:09:27.710 --> 04:09:27.720 align:start position:0%
lights activated on the side of the road
 
04:09:30.229 --> 04:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
it's not intended for the disabled
 
04:09:32.389 --> 04:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
vehicle although we would strongly
 
04:09:35.109 --> 04:09:35.119 align:start position:0%
encourage people again to slow down and
 
04:09:37.550 --> 04:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
move over so that you don't strike that
 
04:09:39.070 --> 04:09:39.080 align:start position:0%
that vehicle if it is close to the
 
04:09:41.389 --> 04:09:41.399 align:start position:0%
shoulder of the road thank you followup
 
04:09:44.309 --> 04:09:44.319 align:start position:0%
follow up to my initial question on uh
 
04:09:46.870 --> 04:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
where it says warning lights uh I would
 
04:09:49.830 --> 04:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
feel an amendment stating uh flashing
 
04:09:52.229 --> 04:09:52.239 align:start position:0%
hazard lights Andor
 
04:09:54.630 --> 04:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
flares that would then determine that
 
04:09:56.429 --> 04:09:56.439 align:start position:0%
you need to move out of the way and it's
 
04:09:58.790 --> 04:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
not an abandoned vehicle or something to
 
04:10:01.710 --> 04:10:01.720 align:start position:0%
that effect uh I something identifying
 
04:10:03.710 --> 04:10:03.720 align:start position:0%
this is an emergency situation and to
 
04:10:08.950 --> 04:10:08.960 align:start position:0%
yield that would be my uh suggestion
 
04:10:11.469 --> 04:10:11.479 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions
 
04:10:13.790 --> 04:10:13.800 align:start position:0%
representative sellers than thank you Mr
 
04:10:17.469 --> 04:10:17.479 align:start position:0%
chair so on on um line seven of the bill
 
04:10:20.990 --> 04:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
it says maintain a reduced speed so if
 
04:10:22.990 --> 04:10:23.000 align:start position:0%
the speed limit is
 
04:10:26.469 --> 04:10:26.479 align:start position:0%
70 if I reduce to 65 is that good I'm
 
04:10:27.750 --> 04:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out what the reduced
 
04:10:30.429 --> 04:10:30.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:32.950 --> 04:10:32.960 align:start position:0%
be that won't be defined it's just going
 
04:10:35.670 --> 04:10:35.680 align:start position:0%
to be to slow down
 
04:10:37.990 --> 04:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
um as safely as you can we're not
 
04:10:39.309 --> 04:10:39.319 align:start position:0%
looking for anybody
 
04:10:42.229 --> 04:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
to reduce their speed so that they get
 
04:10:44.950 --> 04:10:44.960 align:start position:0%
rear ended but again it's just to uh and
 
04:10:47.550 --> 04:10:47.560 align:start position:0%
if you can put your hazard lights on if
 
04:10:49.670 --> 04:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
that's appropriate in that moment then
 
04:10:51.910 --> 04:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
then do so we're just looking for
 
04:10:54.750 --> 04:10:54.760 align:start position:0%
operators to be to be
 
04:10:57.030 --> 04:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
safe any further questions from the
 
04:10:57.040 --> 04:10:58.510 align:start position:0%
safe any further questions from the
committee

04:10:58.510 --> 04:10:58.520 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:11:02.229 --> 04:11:02.239 align:start position:0%
no chairman Walsh welcome back oh no
 
04:11:04.790 --> 04:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
you're chairman thank you Mr chairman I
 
04:11:06.790 --> 04:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
just just one question is there any
 
04:11:09.030 --> 04:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
advantage to having uh laws like this in
 
04:11:13.070 --> 04:11:13.080 align:start position:0%
the books even difficult to enforce uh
 
04:11:15.630 --> 04:11:15.640 align:start position:0%
when it comes time for say convictions
 
04:11:18.990 --> 04:11:19.000 align:start position:0%
in accidents the the because we I think
 
04:11:20.429 --> 04:11:20.439 align:start position:0%
we can all see that this is not an easy
 
04:11:23.030 --> 04:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
one to enforc is there a value to having
 
04:11:24.830 --> 04:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
it in the
 
04:11:28.109 --> 04:11:28.119 align:start position:0%
books there is Great Value to it uh as I
 
04:11:30.109 --> 04:11:30.119 align:start position:0%
stated before the vast majority of
 
04:11:32.389 --> 04:11:32.399 align:start position:0%
people are law-abiding citizens and if
 
04:11:34.030 --> 04:11:34.040 align:start position:0%
they know that this is the law they're
 
04:11:37.389 --> 04:11:37.399 align:start position:0%
going to abide by it not because they
 
04:11:39.189 --> 04:11:39.199 align:start position:0%
are afraid of a consequence but because
 
04:11:41.670 --> 04:11:41.680 align:start position:0%
it's the right thing to do so I think
 
04:11:44.269 --> 04:11:44.279 align:start position:0%
having this on the books will greatly
 
04:11:46.830 --> 04:11:46.840 align:start position:0%
enhance safety across the state thank
 
04:11:49.469 --> 04:11:49.479 align:start position:0%
you any further questions from the
 
04:11:52.389 --> 04:11:52.399 align:start position:0%
committee no one law one law
 
04:11:53.950 --> 04:11:53.960 align:start position:0%
representative sellers thank you Mr
 
04:11:57.750 --> 04:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
chair I'm sorry uh as representative
 
04:12:01.149 --> 04:12:01.159 align:start position:0%
wbor so there is is there any penalty
 
04:12:02.550 --> 04:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm getting it's is there
 
04:12:03.790 --> 04:12:03.800 align:start position:0%
any penalty if there someone doesn't
 
04:12:03.800 --> 04:12:04.670 align:start position:0%
any penalty if there someone doesn't
slow

04:12:04.670 --> 04:12:04.680 align:start position:0%
slow
 
04:12:07.429 --> 04:12:07.439 align:start position:0%
down yes it's a violation uh first
 
04:12:08.269 --> 04:12:08.279 align:start position:0%
offense is
 
04:12:10.630 --> 04:12:10.640 align:start position:0%
$75 uh second offense within 12 months
 
04:12:10.640 --> 04:12:12.149 align:start position:0%
$75 uh second offense within 12 months
is

04:12:12.149 --> 04:12:12.159 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:12:12.159 --> 04:12:15.349 align:start position:0%
is
$150

04:12:15.349 --> 04:12:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:17.990 --> 04:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
any other questions not seeing any thank
 
04:12:20.870 --> 04:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
you sir chair i' like to recognize Bill
 
04:12:23.109 --> 04:12:23.119 align:start position:0%
Lambert from New Hampshire do
 
04:12:24.510 --> 04:12:24.520 align:start position:0%
represented the
 
04:12:27.269 --> 04:12:27.279 align:start position:0%
do asking for five
 
04:12:31.670 --> 04:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
minutes uh who supports the bill welcome
 
04:12:34.429 --> 04:12:34.439 align:start position:0%
sir good afternoon um thank you Mr
 
04:12:36.670 --> 04:12:36.680 align:start position:0%
chairman and members of the committee uh
 
04:12:38.630 --> 04:12:38.640 align:start position:0%
the dot does support this bill as we
 
04:12:40.550 --> 04:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
testified in the Senate
 
04:12:43.670 --> 04:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
Transportation um the sponsor reference
 
04:12:44.990 --> 04:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
the the accident that happened just
 
04:12:46.510 --> 04:12:46.520 align:start position:0%
before Christmas this year a young man
 
04:12:48.750 --> 04:12:48.760 align:start position:0%
from Pittsfield uh I know people that
 
04:12:51.429 --> 04:12:51.439 align:start position:0%
know the family uh and understand that
 
04:12:54.550 --> 04:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
the um the deceased had called his F his
 
04:12:56.469 --> 04:12:56.479 align:start position:0%
sister for assistance and she was the
 
04:12:57.870 --> 04:12:57.880 align:start position:0%
first on the scene before the first
 
04:13:00.309 --> 04:13:00.319 align:start position:0%
respond so I don't think you need any
 
04:13:03.790 --> 04:13:03.800 align:start position:0%
more um evidence than that to show that
 
04:13:06.149 --> 04:13:06.159 align:start position:0%
people that aren't moving over um if
 
04:13:08.229 --> 04:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
you're not in the if you're not in the
 
04:13:10.109 --> 04:13:10.119 align:start position:0%
the adjacent Lane to give more room for
 
04:13:12.670 --> 04:13:12.680 align:start position:0%
error there's more of a margin for error
 
04:13:15.510 --> 04:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
um so certainly any any more margin for
 
04:13:17.710 --> 04:13:17.720 align:start position:0%
error from a highway safety perspective
 
04:13:20.070 --> 04:13:20.080 align:start position:0%
is is a benefit and uh we would support
 
04:13:22.189 --> 04:13:22.199 align:start position:0%
that we understand that it's tough to uh
 
04:13:26.189 --> 04:13:26.199 align:start position:0%
to enforce um but if we can promote uh
 
04:13:28.550 --> 04:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
that Move Over Law and to uh to respond
 
04:13:30.790 --> 04:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
to representative Hills question
 
04:13:33.030 --> 04:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
observation no data uh we have a similar
 
04:13:34.830 --> 04:13:34.840 align:start position:0%
Bill moving over for bicyclists
 
04:13:37.790 --> 04:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
graduated by speed and and I have seen a
 
04:13:39.910 --> 04:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
fair trend of people and obviously
 
04:13:41.550 --> 04:13:41.560 align:start position:0%
that's on two-way Road two directional
 
04:13:43.830 --> 04:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
roads I have seen it trend of people
 
04:13:45.309 --> 04:13:45.319 align:start position:0%
that are moving across the yellow line
 
04:13:46.870 --> 04:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
to go around a bicyclist when there's
 
04:13:49.149 --> 04:13:49.159 align:start position:0%
oncoming traffic I'm not sure what we do
 
04:13:51.269 --> 04:13:51.279 align:start position:0%
to defeat that it seems illogical to me
 
04:13:52.790 --> 04:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
that you would be willing to drive into
 
04:13:54.189 --> 04:13:54.199 align:start position:0%
the opposing Lane when there's a car
 
04:13:57.229 --> 04:13:57.239 align:start position:0%
coming to meet the Move Over Law uh I
 
04:13:58.950 --> 04:13:58.960 align:start position:0%
don't know if that's so much the case on
 
04:14:00.830 --> 04:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
on the divided highway when we get Lanes
 
04:14:02.429 --> 04:14:02.439 align:start position:0%
in the same direction but I have seen
 
04:14:04.750 --> 04:14:04.760 align:start position:0%
that on the bike law and I'd be happy to
 
04:14:07.670 --> 04:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
answer any questions Sarah any questions
 
04:14:09.469 --> 04:14:09.479 align:start position:0%
from the
 
04:14:12.710 --> 04:14:12.720 align:start position:0%
committee representative put thank you
 
04:14:14.229 --> 04:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
04:14:16.750 --> 04:14:16.760 align:start position:0%
um will there be increased signage or
 
04:14:18.109 --> 04:14:18.119 align:start position:0%
how how will this be promoted from the
 
04:14:21.070 --> 04:14:21.080 align:start position:0%
do perspective the electronic signage or
 
04:14:23.710 --> 04:14:23.720 align:start position:0%
it be um permanent signage put on the
 
04:14:25.990 --> 04:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
sides of the road or what will that look
 
04:14:29.510 --> 04:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
like thank you for the question um we
 
04:14:31.910 --> 04:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
already work with safety on the on the
 
04:14:34.349 --> 04:14:34.359 align:start position:0%
Move overr in general for uh right now
 
04:14:36.590 --> 04:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
it says red red blue Amber lights or
 
04:14:39.269 --> 04:14:39.279 align:start position:0%
blue red Amber whatever it is move over
 
04:14:41.469 --> 04:14:41.479 align:start position:0%
um so we have to combine that kind of
 
04:14:43.189 --> 04:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
simple concise message that we can put
 
04:14:45.469 --> 04:14:45.479 align:start position:0%
on our changeable message signs with
 
04:14:47.870 --> 04:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
something that's going to be um other
 
04:14:49.670 --> 04:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
media so that people can correlate the
 
04:14:53.349 --> 04:14:53.359 align:start position:0%
two um signing is difficult because it
 
04:14:55.189 --> 04:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
the the language in the bill is
 
04:14:57.429 --> 04:14:57.439 align:start position:0%
complicated it seems simple move over
 
04:14:58.469 --> 04:14:58.479 align:start position:0%
when there's somebody on the side of the
 
04:15:00.670 --> 04:15:00.680 align:start position:0%
road um but the nuances of the bill can
 
04:15:03.389 --> 04:15:03.399 align:start position:0%
be complicated to put on a sign so um
 
04:15:04.550 --> 04:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
the easiest thing that we can put on a
 
04:15:07.109 --> 04:15:07.119 align:start position:0%
sign is the changeable message um signs
 
04:15:09.510 --> 04:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
um those are changed once a month or
 
04:15:11.429 --> 04:15:11.439 align:start position:0%
whatever to combine with a safety
 
04:15:14.910 --> 04:15:14.920 align:start position:0%
program um so if we can use that uh
 
04:15:17.950 --> 04:15:17.960 align:start position:0%
occasional signing to to support a
 
04:15:19.990 --> 04:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
broader media campaign uh we'll work
 
04:15:22.670 --> 04:15:22.680 align:start position:0%
with Department of Safety to do
 
04:15:25.149 --> 04:15:25.159 align:start position:0%
that any further questions from the
 
04:15:28.229 --> 04:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any thank you
 
04:15:30.910 --> 04:15:30.920 align:start position:0%
sir chair i' like to recognize now Dan
 
04:15:32.870 --> 04:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
Goodwin from Triple A who supports the
 
04:15:34.910 --> 04:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
bill who does have some written
 
04:15:37.349 --> 04:15:37.359 align:start position:0%
testimony and has asked for three
 
04:15:41.910 --> 04:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you sir welcome to
 
04:15:41.920 --> 04:15:49.630 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you sir welcome to
transportation

04:15:49.630 --> 04:15:49.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:51.790 --> 04:15:51.800 align:start position:0%
right good afternoon thank you very much
 
04:15:53.750 --> 04:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Dan Goodman
 
04:15:55.269 --> 04:15:55.279 align:start position:0%
I'm the public affairs manager for tripa
 
04:15:57.510 --> 04:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
Northern England and as the chair said
 
04:16:01.070 --> 04:16:01.080 align:start position:0%
uh I'm here in support of the bill um
 
04:16:03.070 --> 04:16:03.080 align:start position:0%
these additions will provide drivers
 
04:16:04.910 --> 04:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
with an additional layer protection when
 
04:16:07.229 --> 04:16:07.239 align:start position:0%
they're on the side of the road sadly
 
04:16:09.030 --> 04:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
has been mentioned there are examples of
 
04:16:10.550 --> 04:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
motorists with disabled Vehicles being
 
04:16:11.910 --> 04:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
struck on the side of the road as was
 
04:16:15.030 --> 04:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh the young man in San Borton
 
04:16:17.309 --> 04:16:17.319 align:start position:0%
um there's limited data but according to
 
04:16:18.710 --> 04:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
a report from the Insurance Institute
 
04:16:21.149 --> 04:16:21.159 align:start position:0%
for Highway Safety it is estimated that
 
04:16:23.670 --> 04:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
over a three-year period 566 people were
 
04:16:26.269 --> 04:16:26.279 align:start position:0%
killed and 14,000 were
 
04:16:29.510 --> 04:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
injured um in crashes on all types of
 
04:16:32.950 --> 04:16:32.960 align:start position:0%
Roads involving a disabled vehicle um
 
04:16:34.389 --> 04:16:34.399 align:start position:0%
and then there was a classification
 
04:16:36.670 --> 04:16:36.680 align:start position:0%
sadly about every year 23 roadside
 
04:16:39.389 --> 04:16:39.399 align:start position:0%
workers lose their life at the roadside
 
04:16:41.469 --> 04:16:41.479 align:start position:0%
um tending to disabled Vehicles every
 
04:16:44.349 --> 04:16:44.359 align:start position:0%
year um we at the tri the AAA foundation
 
04:16:46.389 --> 04:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
for Traffic Safety recently did a survey
 
04:16:48.870 --> 04:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
where a quarter of the respondents are
 
04:16:51.510 --> 04:16:51.520 align:start position:0%
unaware of the Move Over Law in their
 
04:16:54.910 --> 04:16:54.920 align:start position:0%
state and there are F there is a law in
 
04:16:54.920 --> 04:16:55.750 align:start position:0%
state and there are F there is a law in
every

04:16:55.750 --> 04:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
every
 
04:16:59.469 --> 04:16:59.479 align:start position:0%
state um so the the intent of this law
 
04:17:00.910 --> 04:17:00.920 align:start position:0%
has been talked about and what we really
 
04:17:03.149 --> 04:17:03.159 align:start position:0%
want to get through is whether it's a
 
04:17:04.630 --> 04:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
police officer whether it's a
 
04:17:07.070 --> 04:17:07.080 align:start position:0%
firefighter whether it's tow truck dot
 
04:17:09.550 --> 04:17:09.560 align:start position:0%
or a motorist with a flat TI Side Road
 
04:17:11.229 --> 04:17:11.239 align:start position:0%
this is designed to create a behavior
 
04:17:13.309 --> 04:17:13.319 align:start position:0%
change to improve roadside safety
 
04:17:15.630 --> 04:17:15.640 align:start position:0%
regardless of the vehicle involved and
 
04:17:17.469 --> 04:17:17.479 align:start position:0%
red redirect people a to think of the
 
04:17:19.510 --> 04:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
person at the side of the road and so
 
04:17:21.590 --> 04:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
with increasing speeds on our highways
 
04:17:23.389 --> 04:17:23.399 align:start position:0%
it is difficult for motorists to
 
04:17:25.109 --> 04:17:25.119 align:start position:0%
distinguish between the nuances of the
 
04:17:29.109 --> 04:17:29.119 align:start position:0%
law this will simplify the law as uh Mr
 
04:17:30.950 --> 04:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
Lambert from dot said in the variable
 
04:17:32.349 --> 04:17:32.359 align:start position:0%
message boards which that the state does
 
04:17:34.750 --> 04:17:34.760 align:start position:0%
a fantastic job if you travel around uh
 
04:17:37.670 --> 04:17:37.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I think stands above uh
 
04:17:42.030 --> 04:17:42.040 align:start position:0%
with their the variable message uh signs
 
04:17:43.790 --> 04:17:43.800 align:start position:0%
it's it's somewhat confusing you you're
 
04:17:45.149 --> 04:17:45.159 align:start position:0%
driving down the road do I need to pull
 
04:17:46.950 --> 04:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
over for this move slow down move over
 
04:17:48.990 --> 04:17:49.000 align:start position:0%
for a red Amber so if we could have a
 
04:17:52.229 --> 04:17:52.239 align:start position:0%
simplifi simplified message slow down
 
04:17:53.750 --> 04:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
move over for all I mean that's not what
 
04:17:55.030 --> 04:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to go with the state's going
 
04:17:57.030 --> 04:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
to go with but something simple where
 
04:17:59.630 --> 04:17:59.640 align:start position:0%
all motorists uh we can simplify that
 
04:18:01.469 --> 04:18:01.479 align:start position:0%
for them I think it will create safer
 
04:18:03.950 --> 04:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
roads for the state 20 states have this
 
04:18:06.550 --> 04:18:06.560 align:start position:0%
law this expanded law where they're uh
 
04:18:09.670 --> 04:18:09.680 align:start position:0%
for disabled vehicles or other motorists
 
04:18:11.469 --> 04:18:11.479 align:start position:0%
so in conclusion New Hampshire's Move
 
04:18:13.670 --> 04:18:13.680 align:start position:0%
Over Law could be enhanced by this by
 
04:18:15.349 --> 04:18:15.359 align:start position:0%
passing this includes protections for
 
04:18:17.510 --> 04:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
motorists that find themselves roadside
 
04:18:19.469 --> 04:18:19.479 align:start position:0%
this would also help clarify confusion
 
04:18:21.149 --> 04:18:21.159 align:start position:0%
and create a standard for slowing down
 
04:18:23.830 --> 04:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
and passing stopped or standing Vehicles
 
04:18:25.269 --> 04:18:25.279 align:start position:0%
as an advocate for the safety of all
 
04:18:26.469 --> 04:18:26.479 align:start position:0%
those working or stranded at the
 
04:18:29.189 --> 04:18:29.199 align:start position:0%
roadside tripa encourage you to support
 
04:18:30.469 --> 04:18:30.479 align:start position:0%
this bill and to bring awareness to the
 
04:18:32.269 --> 04:18:32.279 align:start position:0%
move over laws and help improve Highway
 
04:18:34.030 --> 04:18:34.040 align:start position:0%

510

04:19:11.710 --> 04:19:11.720 align:start position:0%

hearing on
 
04:19:48.149 --> 04:19:48.159 align:start position:0%
sb510 relative to a sale of a vehicle to
 
04:19:51.189 --> 04:19:51.199 align:start position:0%
a Massachusetts resident and the chair
 
04:19:53.309 --> 04:19:53.319 align:start position:0%
would like to recognize Senator Fenton
 
04:19:56.189 --> 04:19:56.199 align:start position:0%
again welcome back sir been a
 
04:19:59.670 --> 04:19:59.680 align:start position:0%
while thank you uh Mr chair and members
 
04:20:01.510 --> 04:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record again I
 
04:20:04.309 --> 04:20:04.319 align:start position:0%
am Senator Donovan Fenton I represent
 
04:20:06.109 --> 04:20:06.119 align:start position:0%
district 10 and I'm here to introduce
 
04:20:08.830 --> 04:20:08.840 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 510 this bill would repeal
 
04:20:11.349 --> 04:20:11.359 align:start position:0%
the requirement for a retail Motor
 
04:20:12.830 --> 04:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
Vehicle Dealer to submit a form
 
04:20:14.750 --> 04:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
notifying the DMV of a car sale to a
 
04:20:16.710 --> 04:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts resident this would allow
 
04:20:19.149 --> 04:20:19.159 align:start position:0%
the dealer to issue a temporary plate to
 
04:20:22.070 --> 04:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
a Massachusetts customer currently every
 
04:20:24.710 --> 04:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
state in America including Hawaii and
 
04:20:27.309 --> 04:20:27.319 align:start position:0%
Alaska recognize New Hampshire New
 
04:20:29.109 --> 04:20:29.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's temporary plate there is
 
04:20:32.870 --> 04:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
only one state that does not and that is
 
04:20:35.030 --> 04:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts one of their main reasons
 
04:20:37.070 --> 04:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
was that they do not issue their own
 
04:20:40.030 --> 04:20:40.040 align:start position:0%
temporary plates that changed in 2022
 
04:20:41.550 --> 04:20:41.560 align:start position:0%
when they did in fact start issuing
 
04:20:43.550 --> 04:20:43.560 align:start position:0%
their own temporary plates PL which New
 
04:20:46.109 --> 04:20:46.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire recognizes so we recognize
 
04:20:48.510 --> 04:20:48.520 align:start position:0%
their temporary plate but according to
 
04:20:50.590 --> 04:20:50.600 align:start position:0%
this they don't recognize ours
 
04:20:52.149 --> 04:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts customer cannot leave New
 
04:20:53.710 --> 04:20:53.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with a car they bought until
 
04:20:55.630 --> 04:20:55.640 align:start position:0%
the dealer fills out a form for the
 
04:20:56.950 --> 04:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts registry in the New
 
04:20:58.990 --> 04:20:59.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire DMV by issuing a temporary
 
04:21:01.830 --> 04:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
plate that gives the seller time to get
 
04:21:03.389 --> 04:21:03.399 align:start position:0%
proper insurance and documentation to
 
04:21:06.070 --> 04:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
the Massachusetts DMV or RMV and the
 
04:21:08.030 --> 04:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
customer does not have to wait the
 
04:21:10.070 --> 04:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
selling dealer still has to register the
 
04:21:11.590 --> 04:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
car for them in Massachusetts so the
 
04:21:13.309 --> 04:21:13.319 align:start position:0%
paperwork is still being done but this
 
04:21:15.070 --> 04:21:15.080 align:start position:0%
gives the customer the ability to have a
 
04:21:16.990 --> 04:21:17.000 align:start position:0%
temporary plate just like every other
 
04:21:19.429 --> 04:21:19.439 align:start position:0%
customer in America gets uh this is a
 
04:21:21.070 --> 04:21:21.080 align:start position:0%
Commerce fairness issue and for the
 
04:21:23.189 --> 04:21:23.199 align:start position:0%
record I'm a car dealer and I do issue
 
04:21:25.349 --> 04:21:25.359 align:start position:0%
temporary plates and I'm happy to take
 
04:21:25.359 --> 04:21:26.429 align:start position:0%
temporary plates and I'm happy to take
any

04:21:26.429 --> 04:21:26.439 align:start position:0%
any
 
04:21:28.429 --> 04:21:28.439 align:start position:0%
questions thank you sir any questions

it's getting towards the end of your
 
04:21:59.349 --> 04:21:59.359 align:start position:0%
work session I'm probably the last
 
04:22:02.070 --> 04:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
lobbyist between you and break so um
 
04:22:03.670 --> 04:22:03.680 align:start position:0%
this will be real quick Senator Fenton
 
04:22:06.269 --> 04:22:06.279 align:start position:0%
did a fantastic job um introducing the
 
04:22:08.229 --> 04:22:08.239 align:start position:0%
bill and summarizing the issue as you
 
04:22:10.630 --> 04:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
know nhada represents 500 businesses in
 
04:22:14.109 --> 04:22:14.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um today uh just on behalf
 
04:22:15.630 --> 04:22:15.640 align:start position:0%
of our franchise and independent car
 
04:22:18.590 --> 04:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
dealers we're here U to support s sp510
 
04:22:21.429 --> 04:22:21.439 align:start position:0%
it really is a fairness issue uh the
 
04:22:23.910 --> 04:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
30,000 foot view pretty simple summary
 
04:22:25.750 --> 04:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
is if Mass dealers can sell to New
 
04:22:27.429 --> 04:22:27.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire customers why can't New
 
04:22:30.070 --> 04:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire dealers sell to mass customers
 
04:22:33.269 --> 04:22:33.279 align:start position:0%
um pretty basic um it's uh correct as
 
04:22:35.790 --> 04:22:35.800 align:start position:0%
you heard for years um New Hampshire or
 
04:22:37.389 --> 04:22:37.399 align:start position:0%
excuse me Massachusetts did not have a
 
04:22:39.510 --> 04:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
template program so they did not honor
 
04:22:42.550 --> 04:22:42.560 align:start position:0%
them they now do um but as a result of a
 
04:22:47.229 --> 04:22:47.239 align:start position:0%
few years back they put RSA uh 26156 a
 
04:22:49.469 --> 04:22:49.479 align:start position:0%
into statute that said a New Hampshire
 
04:22:51.830 --> 04:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
dealer will not issue a template and
 
04:22:54.550 --> 04:22:54.560 align:start position:0%
what you will instead do is a little 3x5
 
04:22:56.149 --> 04:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
form that you report to the New
 
04:22:58.830 --> 04:22:58.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire DMV to report the sale so that
 
04:23:00.510 --> 04:23:00.520 align:start position:0%
the DMV could be able to track how many
 
04:23:01.870 --> 04:23:01.880 align:start position:0%
vehicles were sold in the state of New
 
04:23:04.429 --> 04:23:04.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um they used traditionally
 
04:23:05.510 --> 04:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
they could just do it by counting
 
04:23:07.630 --> 04:23:07.640 align:start position:0%
templates right then you know but if
 
04:23:08.950 --> 04:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
you're not issuing templates they never
 
04:23:10.710 --> 04:23:10.720 align:start position:0%
know so what this bill actually does is
 
04:23:14.870 --> 04:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
repeal that 56a um provision um the
 
04:23:16.990 --> 04:23:17.000 align:start position:0%
current process is is timec consuming
 
04:23:19.870 --> 04:23:19.880 align:start position:0%
and costly um to the dealer and the
 
04:23:22.550 --> 04:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
consumer uh under the current system you
 
04:23:23.910 --> 04:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
either have to sell the car in two
 
04:23:26.670 --> 04:23:26.680 align:start position:0%
visits buy it go down go to the R&amp;V get
 
04:23:28.309 --> 04:23:28.319 align:start position:0%
the information prove Insurance plates
 
04:23:30.790 --> 04:23:30.800 align:start position:0%
come back and then do a second trip or
 
04:23:33.710 --> 04:23:33.720 align:start position:0%
some dealers actually employ um and pay
 
04:23:36.590 --> 04:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
for a runner to go to the Mass RMV do
 
04:23:39.349 --> 04:23:39.359 align:start position:0%
all the paperwork wait in line um and
 
04:23:41.389 --> 04:23:41.399 align:start position:0%
then come back while the customer is
 
04:23:42.870 --> 04:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
actually stuck waiting at the dealership
 
04:23:45.269 --> 04:23:45.279 align:start position:0%
to buy the vehicle of their choice so um
 
04:23:49.109 --> 04:23:49.119 align:start position:0%
this would remove that um and really um
 
04:23:51.990 --> 04:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
level the playing field um to benefit
 
04:23:54.550 --> 04:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
both dealers and and consumers so with
 
04:23:57.070 --> 04:23:57.080 align:start position:0%
that being said we hope you support uh
 
04:24:00.389 --> 04:24:00.399 align:start position:0%
sp510 um and if I can take any questions
 
04:24:02.429 --> 04:24:02.439 align:start position:0%

representative Hill thank you Mr

chairman and thank you for taking my
 
04:24:08.269 --> 04:24:08.279 align:start position:0%
question I'm not the brightest bulb in
 
04:24:11.510 --> 04:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
the world so are you saying that a New
 
04:24:13.070 --> 04:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire dealer
 
04:24:16.149 --> 04:24:16.159 align:start position:0%
um would be issuing or can issue with
 
04:24:20.429 --> 04:24:20.439 align:start position:0%
this if this were to pass a
 
04:24:23.870 --> 04:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts um temporary plate uh
 
04:24:24.990 --> 04:24:25.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question represent
 
04:24:27.830 --> 04:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
Hill um no sir they will actually a New
 
04:24:29.670 --> 04:24:29.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire dealer will issue a New
 
04:24:31.670 --> 04:24:31.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire template to the Massachusetts
 
04:24:33.389 --> 04:24:33.399 align:start position:0%
customer the same exact way they're
 
04:24:35.510 --> 04:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
doing right now to someone from Maine
 
04:24:38.309 --> 04:24:38.319 align:start position:0%
Vermont Conneticut New York it's a New
 
04:24:40.429 --> 04:24:40.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire template is issued to the to
 
04:24:40.439 --> 04:24:41.309 align:start position:0%
Hampshire template is issued to the to
the

04:24:41.309 --> 04:24:41.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:24:46.149 --> 04:24:46.159 align:start position:0%
purchaser follow up um okay so does that
 
04:24:50.389 --> 04:24:50.399 align:start position:0%
uh what what changes with Massachusetts
 
04:24:52.990 --> 04:24:53.000 align:start position:0%
not recognizing the New Hampshire
 
04:24:56.349 --> 04:24:56.359 align:start position:0%
temporary plate by us passing along so
 
04:24:58.149 --> 04:24:58.159 align:start position:0%
what Massachusetts used to say and what
 
04:25:00.630 --> 04:25:00.640 align:start position:0%
we were told um as dealers and I believe
 
04:25:02.990 --> 04:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
also as the DMV but but um I don't want
 
04:25:04.670 --> 04:25:04.680 align:start position:0%
to respond for them is that
 
04:25:06.510 --> 04:25:06.520 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts does what we've been told
 
04:25:08.750 --> 04:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
we're told Massachusetts does not honor
 
04:25:10.550 --> 04:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire templates because
 
04:25:12.990 --> 04:25:13.000 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts does not have it template
 
04:25:17.229 --> 04:25:17.239 align:start position:0%
program M so since Massachusetts now has
 
04:25:20.269 --> 04:25:20.279 align:start position:0%
a template program we would infer that
 
04:25:21.830 --> 04:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
they will in fact honor the New
 
04:25:23.510 --> 04:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire template because now they do
 
04:25:26.269 --> 04:25:26.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:29.429 --> 04:25:29.439 align:start position:0%
program additional followup thank you
 
04:25:31.389 --> 04:25:31.399 align:start position:0%
but they don't have to right I mean
 
04:25:33.590 --> 04:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
isn't Massachusetts making their own
 
04:25:36.670 --> 04:25:36.680 align:start position:0%
rules and so we are passing a law saying
 
04:25:39.750 --> 04:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts shall recognize our
 
04:25:42.429 --> 04:25:42.439 align:start position:0%
temporary plates now that you have one
 
04:25:44.670 --> 04:25:44.680 align:start position:0%
is that am I missing something what
 
04:25:46.389 --> 04:25:46.399 align:start position:0%
we're actually doing this bill is not
 
04:25:48.469 --> 04:25:48.479 align:start position:0%
dictating to to Massachusetts what they
 
04:25:50.870 --> 04:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
have to do is we're dictating to New
 
04:25:52.349 --> 04:25:52.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire dealers that they're allowed
 
04:25:55.510 --> 04:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
to issue templates to a customer really
 
04:25:58.469 --> 04:25:58.479 align:start position:0%
no matter what state they live in now if
 
04:26:01.070 --> 04:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
what Massachusetts State Police chooses
 
04:26:03.590 --> 04:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
to do is line up a bunch of blue
 
04:26:06.950 --> 04:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
explorers at the line between Salem and
 
04:26:08.990 --> 04:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
and what ha whatever the town may be you
 
04:26:10.269 --> 04:26:10.279 align:start position:0%
know I can't I can't speak for what
 
04:26:12.070 --> 04:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and and state police will
 
04:26:14.670 --> 04:26:14.680 align:start position:0%
do in in terms of their policy but what
 
04:26:17.510 --> 04:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
this bill does is because it allows New
 
04:26:19.389 --> 04:26:19.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire dealers to issue templates to
 
04:26:22.790 --> 04:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts customers okay thank you
 
04:26:22.800 --> 04:26:24.510 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts customers okay thank you
representative

04:26:24.510 --> 04:26:24.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:26:27.070 --> 04:26:27.080 align:start position:0%
clemon thank you Mr chair thank you and
 
04:26:28.710 --> 04:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
Mr Hill I representative Hill to ask
 
04:26:31.389 --> 04:26:31.399 align:start position:0%
most of my questions my last my final
 
04:26:33.910 --> 04:26:33.920 align:start position:0%
question is just do you foresee an
 
04:26:36.429 --> 04:26:36.439 align:start position:0%
increase in Revenue uh Auto Revenue
 
04:26:40.269 --> 04:26:40.279 align:start position:0%
sales uh should this pass on buying
 
04:26:41.710 --> 04:26:41.720 align:start position:0%
vehicles in the taxfree state of New
 
04:26:41.720 --> 04:26:44.070 align:start position:0%
vehicles in the taxfree state of New
Hampshire

04:26:44.070 --> 04:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:26:46.309 --> 04:26:46.319 align:start position:0%
uh my crystal ball is broken but I would
 
04:26:48.950 --> 04:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
hope so um make the what it would do is
 
04:26:51.630 --> 04:26:51.640 align:start position:0%
it would make the the sales process for
 
04:26:53.229 --> 04:26:53.239 align:start position:0%
a Massachusetts customer who wants to
 
04:26:54.910 --> 04:26:54.920 align:start position:0%
come to a New Hampshire dealer a little
 
04:26:54.920 --> 04:26:55.590 align:start position:0%
come to a New Hampshire dealer a little
bit

04:26:55.590 --> 04:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
bit
 
04:26:58.510 --> 04:26:58.520 align:start position:0%
easier thank you any other questions
 
04:27:01.189 --> 04:27:01.199 align:start position:0%
from the committee not seeing any thank
 
04:27:03.070 --> 04:27:03.080 align:start position:0%
you sir thank you members of the
 
04:27:06.030 --> 04:27:06.040 align:start position:0%
committee chair like now recognize uh
 
04:27:08.790 --> 04:27:08.800 align:start position:0%
director morasco again welcome sir uh
 
04:27:11.550 --> 04:27:11.560 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire DMV uh he says
 
04:27:14.349 --> 04:27:14.359 align:start position:0%
information testimony for two minutes
 
04:27:15.710 --> 04:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
04:27:17.349 --> 04:27:17.359 align:start position:0%
committee John morasco director of the
 
04:27:19.830 --> 04:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
DMV uh I'll be very brief everything has
 
04:27:22.229 --> 04:27:22.239 align:start position:0%
been covered thus far in the testimony
 
04:27:25.469 --> 04:27:25.479 align:start position:0%
um I would say from a DMV standpoint um
 
04:27:27.710 --> 04:27:27.720 align:start position:0%
the gains that we see in this bill are
 
04:27:30.109 --> 04:27:30.119 align:start position:0%
the forms so it's a three-part form that
 
04:27:31.830 --> 04:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
has to be completed at the time of
 
04:27:34.269 --> 04:27:34.279 align:start position:0%
purchase uh I'm told that we have tens
 
04:27:36.550 --> 04:27:36.560 align:start position:0%
of thousands of these in boxes at the
 
04:27:38.309 --> 04:27:38.319 align:start position:0%
DMV that are stacked up in the
 
04:27:40.309 --> 04:27:40.319 align:start position:0%
registration Bureau um and that takes
 
04:27:42.149 --> 04:27:42.159 align:start position:0%
time to process those when they come in
 
04:27:43.870 --> 04:27:43.880 align:start position:0%
so there's a cost savings on not
 
04:27:46.189 --> 04:27:46.199 align:start position:0%
producing the forms any longer and um
 
04:27:48.109 --> 04:27:48.119 align:start position:0%
there's a savings on time with not
 
04:27:50.189 --> 04:27:50.199 align:start position:0%
taking those forms in and handling them
 
04:27:53.269 --> 04:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
at the DMV I'm happy to take any
 
04:27:55.309 --> 04:27:55.319 align:start position:0%
questions thank you sir any questions
 
04:27:57.149 --> 04:27:57.159 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative
 
04:27:59.269 --> 04:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
sellers thank you Mr chair so I'm just
 
04:28:01.349 --> 04:28:01.359 align:start position:0%
trying to understand if we're going to
 
04:28:04.349 --> 04:28:04.359 align:start position:0%
allow this now right into those people
 
04:28:06.670 --> 04:28:06.680 align:start position:0%
that live in Massachusetts as soon as
 
04:28:08.550 --> 04:28:08.560 align:start position:0%
they drive back to Massachusetts with a
 
04:28:11.109 --> 04:28:11.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire temporary plate are they
 
04:28:12.910 --> 04:28:12.920 align:start position:0%
going to get fined on their end and
 
04:28:15.750 --> 04:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
maybe blame us for something is that
 
04:28:18.469 --> 04:28:18.479 align:start position:0%
possible so that's a very good question
 
04:28:20.990 --> 04:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
um you know I leave that to the sponsor
 
04:28:23.269 --> 04:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
um and others that would want to testify
 
04:28:24.710 --> 04:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
to that those are conversations that
 
04:28:27.269 --> 04:28:27.279 align:start position:0%
have been had I've heard conversations
 
04:28:29.790 --> 04:28:29.800 align:start position:0%
about and I don't know if it's in motion
 
04:28:32.670 --> 04:28:32.680 align:start position:0%
as far as a a disclaimer to be given out
 
04:28:35.269 --> 04:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
um at the time of purchase um so that
 
04:28:36.990 --> 04:28:37.000 align:start position:0%
the uh the individual knows that the
 
04:28:40.710 --> 04:28:40.720 align:start position:0%
temporary plate um is not recognized by
 
04:28:42.990 --> 04:28:43.000 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts at this time
 
04:28:45.429 --> 04:28:45.439 align:start position:0%
but that's
 
04:28:48.229 --> 04:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
uh from a DMV standpoint I'll just speak
 
04:28:49.790 --> 04:28:49.800 align:start position:0%
to the financial aspect of it and the
 
04:28:51.590 --> 04:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
processing part I that's a little larger
 
04:28:54.429 --> 04:28:54.439 align:start position:0%
than what I would get into here
 
04:28:56.149 --> 04:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
representative Fenton you have a answer
 
04:28:58.349 --> 04:28:58.359 align:start position:0%
to that yeah I can I can answer that we
 
04:29:00.149 --> 04:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
SP we spoke about this in Senate it's
 
04:29:02.149 --> 04:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
always good sitting next to you you
 
04:29:04.670 --> 04:29:04.680 align:start position:0%
know we spoke about that in Senate
 
04:29:06.109 --> 04:29:06.119 align:start position:0%
transportation and you know it is kind
 
04:29:09.030 --> 04:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
of at your will to do that and you know
 
04:29:11.309 --> 04:29:11.319 align:start position:0%
there would be disclaimers written like
 
04:29:12.790 --> 04:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
hey you're purchasing car you have the
 
04:29:14.109 --> 04:29:14.119 align:start position:0%
option if you want that temporary plate
 
04:29:15.590 --> 04:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
or not you don't have to accept it we
 
04:29:17.630 --> 04:29:17.640 align:start position:0%
can go through the RMV which is the the
 
04:29:19.910 --> 04:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts DMV or you can take the
 
04:29:22.309 --> 04:29:22.319 align:start position:0%
temporary plate um you know we don't
 
04:29:24.750 --> 04:29:24.760 align:start position:0%
make laws based on other states you know
 
04:29:27.309 --> 04:29:27.319 align:start position:0%
this is New Hampshire every state and
 
04:29:29.349 --> 04:29:29.359 align:start position:0%
Hawaii recognizes the temporary plate
 
04:29:30.830 --> 04:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
except Massachusetts but now they have
 
04:29:32.790 --> 04:29:32.800 align:start position:0%
their own temporary plate
 
04:29:35.990 --> 04:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
system did that answer your
 
04:29:39.149 --> 04:29:39.159 align:start position:0%
question may follow up yeah um the
 
04:29:40.630 --> 04:29:40.640 align:start position:0%
question really was I don't want to see
 
04:29:43.149 --> 04:29:43.159 align:start position:0%
any blowback on new campire because they
 
04:29:45.710 --> 04:29:45.720 align:start position:0%
crossed the state line with our plate
 
04:29:48.149 --> 04:29:48.159 align:start position:0%
you know saying it was all right to have
 
04:29:49.309 --> 04:29:49.319 align:start position:0%
yeah absolutely representative I
 
04:29:50.710 --> 04:29:50.720 align:start position:0%
appreciate the question and I don't
 
04:29:52.309 --> 04:29:52.319 align:start position:0%
think the dealers want to feel that
 
04:29:54.030 --> 04:29:54.040 align:start position:0%
blowback either or the Independent Car
 
04:29:56.109 --> 04:29:56.119 align:start position:0%
Store that's selling that car or you
 
04:29:57.670 --> 04:29:57.680 align:start position:0%
know the body shop that's selling that
 
04:30:00.189 --> 04:30:00.199 align:start position:0%
car it really comes down to you know the
 
04:30:02.349 --> 04:30:02.359 align:start position:0%
awareness aspect that like hey you can
 
04:30:05.229 --> 04:30:05.239 align:start position:0%
now issue a temporary plate FYI you know
 
04:30:06.750 --> 04:30:06.760 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts has their own temporary
 
04:30:08.870 --> 04:30:08.880 align:start position:0%

Hampshire's temporary plates and now
 
04:30:45.990 --> 04:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts is issuing their own
 
04:30:48.750 --> 04:30:48.760 align:start position:0%
temporary plates which we all recognize
 
04:30:51.070 --> 04:30:51.080 align:start position:0%
except that you know we have this repeal
 
04:30:53.229 --> 04:30:53.239 align:start position:0%
that we're doing that would now allow us
 
04:30:55.109 --> 04:30:55.119 align:start position:0%
to issue that Massachusetts customer at
 
04:30:58.510 --> 04:30:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:03.149 --> 04:31:03.159 align:start position:0%

Crawford thank you Senator it's nice to

see you it's good to see you so would it
 
04:31:08.990 --> 04:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
not be easy if you're talking about a
 
04:31:11.429 --> 04:31:11.439 align:start position:0%
disclaimer to when when you sell the
 
04:31:11.439 --> 04:31:12.710 align:start position:0%
disclaimer to when when you sell the
vehicle

04:31:12.710 --> 04:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
04:31:15.309 --> 04:31:15.319 align:start position:0%
um I read all the things that they you
 
04:31:16.550 --> 04:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
know I buy a new vehicle you're the only
 
04:31:19.469 --> 04:31:19.479 align:start position:0%
one that does that well I do because I I
 
04:31:22.550 --> 04:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
buy a car every three years but um if I
 
04:31:24.990 --> 04:31:25.000 align:start position:0%
was asked to sign a disclaimer you have
 
04:31:26.830 --> 04:31:26.840 align:start position:0%
a signature there you're you're sending
 
04:31:29.670 --> 04:31:29.680 align:start position:0%
them off uh with them signing a
 
04:31:31.590 --> 04:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
disclaimer that they know if they take
 
04:31:32.990 --> 04:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
that plate and they drive in
 
04:31:35.469 --> 04:31:35.479 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts they could be stopped I
 
04:31:37.030 --> 04:31:37.040 align:start position:0%
mean isn't that
 
04:31:38.950 --> 04:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
enough representative thank you for the
 
04:31:41.510 --> 04:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
question um you know I would never
 
04:31:43.670 --> 04:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
assume enough for you know a buyer or
 
04:31:46.429 --> 04:31:46.439 align:start position:0%
anything like that but um you know it
 
04:31:48.349 --> 04:31:48.359 align:start position:0%
comes down to they don't have to take
 
04:31:49.510 --> 04:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
the temporary plate if they don't feel
 
04:31:51.870 --> 04:31:51.880 align:start position:0%
comfortable you can you know dealers
 
04:31:53.830 --> 04:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
still have to register their car and
 
04:31:55.830 --> 04:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
alert the DMV that we are selling this
 
04:31:57.710 --> 04:31:57.720 align:start position:0%
car to Massachusetts the only difference
 
04:31:58.910 --> 04:31:58.920 align:start position:0%
now is that we can issue them a
 
04:31:58.920 --> 04:32:00.229 align:start position:0%
now is that we can issue them a
temporary

04:32:00.229 --> 04:32:00.239 align:start position:0%
temporary
 
04:32:03.109 --> 04:32:03.119 align:start position:0%
plate representative Hill thank you Mr
 
04:32:04.229 --> 04:32:04.239 align:start position:0%
chairman if I had known this many
 
04:32:05.990 --> 04:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
questions I would have sat back you know
 
04:32:08.510 --> 04:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
shouldn't yeah right so the question for
 
04:32:11.870 --> 04:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
me is do we know if any of those other
 
04:32:15.149 --> 04:32:15.159 align:start position:0%
suring states that sell to Massachusetts
 
04:32:17.910 --> 04:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
customers have they adopted this same
 
04:32:21.109 --> 04:32:21.119 align:start position:0%
approach of of Simply passing a lar in
 
04:32:23.590 --> 04:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
their state and and are they having
 
04:32:27.030 --> 04:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
problems when when those people from
 
04:32:29.149 --> 04:32:29.159 align:start position:0%
Connecticut and the other states drive
 
04:32:31.910 --> 04:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
back to Massachusetts are they rep are
 
04:32:34.590 --> 04:32:34.600 align:start position:0%

04:33:41.910 --> 04:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
the senator I have spoken about that I
 
04:33:43.629 --> 04:33:43.639 align:start position:0%
have spoken with the RMV director in
 
04:33:45.910 --> 04:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Colleen ogelby uh
 
04:33:48.510 --> 04:33:48.520 align:start position:0%
wonderful leader there um we have talked
 
04:33:50.470 --> 04:33:50.480 align:start position:0%
about just that getting together and
 
04:33:51.670 --> 04:33:51.680 align:start position:0%
maybe speaking with some elected
 
04:33:53.990 --> 04:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
officials in mass and trying to rectify
 
04:33:57.750 --> 04:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
the uh the problem um in the initial
 
04:33:59.310 --> 04:33:59.320 align:start position:0%
stages of conversations though it was
 
04:34:01.709 --> 04:34:01.719 align:start position:0%
explained to me that it's um be quite an
 
04:34:03.590 --> 04:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
uphill battle because it's a fiscal
 
04:34:06.470 --> 04:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
issue there and um that doesn't mean it
 
04:34:08.029 --> 04:34:08.039 align:start position:0%
can't be done and I'm not saying that we
 
04:34:09.830 --> 04:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be investigating that and
 
04:34:12.670 --> 04:34:12.680 align:start position:0%
doing that um but BAS B on the first
 
04:34:14.789 --> 04:34:14.799 align:start position:0%
phone call or two that I had didn't look
 
04:34:16.310 --> 04:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
like that was going to be something that
 
04:34:18.349 --> 04:34:18.359 align:start position:0%
was going to be quick um to be able to
 
04:34:19.429 --> 04:34:19.439 align:start position:0%
pull off but that doesn't mean we
 
04:34:22.029 --> 04:34:22.039 align:start position:0%
shouldn't continue to try for that
 
04:34:24.109 --> 04:34:24.119 align:start position:0%
representative representative Jack uh
 
04:34:27.789 --> 04:34:27.799 align:start position:0%
thank you uh if I'm if I'm a Vermont
 
04:34:29.189 --> 04:34:29.199 align:start position:0%
resident and I buy a car in New
 
04:34:31.230 --> 04:34:31.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire not only do I walk out with
 
04:34:32.750 --> 04:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
the temporary plate I walk out with a
 
04:34:35.709 --> 04:34:35.719 align:start position:0%
registration certificate uh and that has
 
04:34:37.869 --> 04:34:37.879 align:start position:0%
a Vermont so I've Got a New Hampshire
 
04:34:41.029 --> 04:34:41.039 align:start position:0%
temporary registration uh with a Vermont
 
04:34:43.189 --> 04:34:43.199 align:start position:0%
residence address is that how that's
 
04:34:44.990 --> 04:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
going to work and it would be the same
 
04:34:46.990 --> 04:34:47.000 align:start position:0%
if it was a Massachusetts
 
04:34:49.789 --> 04:34:49.799 align:start position:0%
address yes believe
 
04:34:49.799 --> 04:34:52.470 align:start position:0%
address yes believe
yeah

04:34:52.470 --> 04:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:34:54.830 --> 04:34:54.840 align:start position:0%
yeah any other questions from the
 
04:34:57.070 --> 04:34:57.080 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
04:35:00.189 --> 04:35:00.199 align:start position:0%
Jones Thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:35:02.189 --> 04:35:02.199 align:start position:0%
both for being here
 
04:35:04.670 --> 04:35:04.680 align:start position:0%
um the world has changed as far as the
 
04:35:06.789 --> 04:35:06.799 align:start position:0%
way the car dealerships work uh many
 
04:35:09.990 --> 04:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
people now are buying online and taking
 
04:35:11.349 --> 04:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
they're not going into the showrooms
 
04:35:13.349 --> 04:35:13.359 align:start position:0%
anymore they're buying online taking
 
04:35:13.359 --> 04:35:16.189 align:start position:0%
anymore they're buying online taking
delivery

04:35:16.189 --> 04:35:16.199 align:start position:0%
delivery
 
04:35:18.990 --> 04:35:19.000 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of Interstate buys now
 
04:35:20.629 --> 04:35:20.639 align:start position:0%
because people are just finding the car
 
04:35:21.590 --> 04:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
they want
 
04:35:24.750 --> 04:35:24.760 align:start position:0%
online but doesn't this ease the way to
 
04:35:26.949 --> 04:35:26.959 align:start position:0%
sell to Massachusetts residents if if we
 
04:35:29.429 --> 04:35:29.439 align:start position:0%
pass this bill who are you asking
 
04:35:32.230 --> 04:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
representative I I guess it would be you
 
04:35:35.990 --> 04:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
Senator um I'll hand yes
 
04:35:38.310 --> 04:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
sir I I would agree yes I mean there's a
 
04:35:40.109 --> 04:35:40.119 align:start position:0%
lot going on still with an online sale
 
04:35:41.670 --> 04:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
you have Banks involved things like that
 
04:35:42.709 --> 04:35:42.719 align:start position:0%
you still have to be present for
 
04:35:44.830 --> 04:35:44.840 align:start position:0%
paperwork but you know we're trying to
 
04:35:48.029 --> 04:35:48.039 align:start position:0%
make everyone's lives easier and you
 
04:35:50.709 --> 04:35:50.719 align:start position:0%
know it's a reciprocity and a and
 
04:35:53.150 --> 04:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
frankly a Commerce issue you know there
 
04:35:54.830 --> 04:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
are there are neighbors we recognize
 
04:35:56.990 --> 04:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
their temporary plate and they get sign
 
04:36:00.949 --> 04:36:00.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:04.189 --> 04:36:04.199 align:start position:0%
plate representative sers thank you last
 
04:36:07.949 --> 04:36:07.959 align:start position:0%
question for me this uh to the director
 
04:36:09.670 --> 04:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
he did say this is going to save you a
 
04:36:12.551 --> 04:36:12.561 align:start position:0%
lot of money is that correct
 
04:36:14.349 --> 04:36:14.359 align:start position:0%
I don't want to say a lot of money I I
 
04:36:16.109 --> 04:36:16.119 align:start position:0%
haven't done the calculation
 
04:36:18.470 --> 04:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
on well I I think it's going to be more
 
04:36:20.189 --> 04:36:20.199 align:start position:0%
than that certainly with the uh with the
 
04:36:21.510 --> 04:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
three-part form and the fact that we
 
04:36:23.029 --> 04:36:23.039 align:start position:0%
have tens of thousands of those coming
 
04:36:24.949 --> 04:36:24.959 align:start position:0%
in um so those are costly in this day
 
04:36:27.949 --> 04:36:27.959 align:start position:0%
and age to produce um but an exact
 
04:36:29.709 --> 04:36:29.719 align:start position:0%
dollar figure I I don't have for you but
 
04:36:31.189 --> 04:36:31.199 align:start position:0%
I could probably get it I actually have

that I'm not aware of okay so let me
 
05:01:54.190 --> 05:01:54.200 align:start position:0%
just go through here then and and uh
 
05:01:55.470 --> 05:01:55.480 align:start position:0%
hopefully highlight some of the things
 
05:01:57.788 --> 05:01:57.798 align:start position:0%
that happened and uh since we've been
 
05:02:00.510 --> 05:02:00.520 align:start position:0%
gone from earlier today first of all on
 
05:02:02.750 --> 05:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
page one nothing actually changed there
 
05:02:05.548 --> 05:02:05.558 align:start position:0%
so what we talked about this
 
05:02:11.310 --> 05:02:11.320 align:start position:0%
morning um on page two online
 
05:02:15.590 --> 05:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
three uh again we took out and we uh we
 
05:02:18.230 --> 05:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
said no we put a law enforcement and
 
05:02:20.708 --> 05:02:20.718 align:start position:0%
then it we put in shall not where it
 
05:02:23.430 --> 05:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
just said shall okay so that was taken
 
05:02:23.440 --> 05:02:24.590 align:start position:0%
just said shall okay so that was taken
care

05:02:24.590 --> 05:02:24.600 align:start position:0%
care
 
05:02:27.350 --> 05:02:27.360 align:start position:0%
of uh then the next big change is down
 
05:02:28.628 --> 05:02:28.638 align:start position:0%
on lines
 
05:02:33.868 --> 05:02:33.878 align:start position:0%
27 um again we had linear now has cracks
 
05:02:36.150 --> 05:02:36.160 align:start position:0%
but it goes on there
 
05:02:39.990 --> 05:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh it had uh in a seal beam in a seal
 
05:02:43.310 --> 05:02:43.320 align:start position:0%
beam headlight all right shall cause
 
05:02:45.830 --> 05:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
inspection failure right cracks in a
 
05:02:45.840 --> 05:02:47.150 align:start position:0%
inspection failure right cracks in a
seal

05:02:47.150 --> 05:02:47.160 align:start position:0%
seal
 
05:02:50.070 --> 05:02:50.080 align:start position:0%
beam headlamp shall cause inspection
 
05:02:52.868 --> 05:02:52.878 align:start position:0%
failure all right so that's my
 
05:02:54.948 --> 05:02:54.958 align:start position:0%
understanding is the if it's a plastic
 
05:02:58.070 --> 05:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
lens type of uh is that how that works
 
05:03:00.390 --> 05:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
no it isn't so I don't know what that
 
05:03:02.830 --> 05:03:02.840 align:start position:0%
is if I can the seal beams like the old
 
05:03:05.708 --> 05:03:05.718 align:start position:0%
fashioned ones glass and the reflector
 
05:03:07.430 --> 05:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
it's all in one so when the glass is
 
05:03:10.750 --> 05:03:10.760 align:start position:0%
broken it's broken yeah thank you okay
 
05:03:12.110 --> 05:03:12.120 align:start position:0%
there you go so they we're trying to
 
05:03:15.628 --> 05:03:15.638 align:start position:0%
differentiate there at this point okay
 
05:03:18.190 --> 05:03:18.200 align:start position:0%
um and so it goes on in there you guys
 
05:03:20.110 --> 05:03:20.120 align:start position:0%
had a chance to read it but we ALS I
 
05:03:22.830 --> 05:03:22.840 align:start position:0%
also had when I was talking to OS they
 
05:03:27.230 --> 05:03:27.240 align:start position:0%
they were showing us uh another R law or
 
05:03:30.190 --> 05:03:30.200 align:start position:0%
that uh Pennsylvania had and they they
 
05:03:33.670 --> 05:03:33.680 align:start position:0%
used the word on line 31 they clouded or
 
05:03:36.788 --> 05:03:36.798 align:start position:0%
op oxidized you know so we added that
 
05:03:39.390 --> 05:03:39.400 align:start position:0%
just for more a little more clarity and
 
05:03:42.030 --> 05:03:42.040 align:start position:0%
not that but that whole line couple
 
05:03:44.868 --> 05:03:44.878 align:start position:0%
lines there so you know there is no if
 
05:03:46.590 --> 05:03:46.600 align:start position:0%
ends and butts this is really spelled
 
05:03:49.190 --> 05:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
out at this point okay on on this again
 
05:03:52.990 --> 05:03:53.000 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the front lights so um
 
05:03:56.310 --> 05:03:56.320 align:start position:0%
going on from there on page
 
05:03:56.320 --> 05:03:58.670 align:start position:0%
going on from there on page
three

05:03:58.670 --> 05:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
three
 
05:04:01.788 --> 05:04:01.798 align:start position:0%
um and I'll go go back but in any case
 
05:04:05.150 --> 05:04:05.160 align:start position:0%
here again we're talking about the uh
 
05:04:07.830 --> 05:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
the directional in this case here but
 
05:04:10.030 --> 05:04:10.040 align:start position:0%
big part here and also on page two was
 
05:04:12.270 --> 05:04:12.280 align:start position:0%
put in here is that we we're able to use
 
05:04:14.548 --> 05:04:14.558 align:start position:0%
a tape where it's called
 
05:04:19.070 --> 05:04:19.080 align:start position:0%
on uh what line here uh 8 and n i looks
 
05:04:22.190 --> 05:04:22.200 align:start position:0%
like cracks in a directional signal that
 
05:04:25.430 --> 05:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
are covered by color matching Automotive
 
05:04:27.830 --> 05:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
lens tape and that's what the that's
 
05:04:30.510 --> 05:04:30.520 align:start position:0%
what they call it so uh shall not cause
 
05:04:34.390 --> 05:04:34.400 align:start position:0%
okay and that's also on the on the uh
 
05:04:37.390 --> 05:04:37.400 align:start position:0%
front light as well and the key there is
 
05:04:40.310 --> 05:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
the um color matching
 
05:04:44.310 --> 05:04:44.320 align:start position:0%
Automotive um lens tape all right so
 
05:04:48.070 --> 05:04:48.080 align:start position:0%
that's the change and then um going here
 
05:04:50.390 --> 05:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
on trying to see if there's any change
 
05:04:54.708 --> 05:04:54.718 align:start position:0%
on lines 15 16 17 we added the reflected
 
05:04:54.718 --> 05:04:55.708 align:start position:0%
on lines 15 16 17 we added the reflected
tape

05:04:55.708 --> 05:04:55.718 align:start position:0%
tape
 
05:05:00.910 --> 05:05:00.920 align:start position:0%
again all right and the last part uh we
 
05:05:04.190 --> 05:05:04.200 align:start position:0%
we did take out um the windows going up
 
05:05:07.270 --> 05:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
and down that has been removed all right
 
05:05:10.350 --> 05:05:10.360 align:start position:0%
so that's no longer in here
 
05:05:12.868 --> 05:05:12.878 align:start position:0%
and then also on the break uh The Brak
 
05:05:15.350 --> 05:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
Parts here uh the biggest change here
 
05:05:18.750 --> 05:05:18.760 align:start position:0%
was I think it's on the last
 
05:05:23.628 --> 05:05:23.638 align:start position:0%
page uh where it's uh line two which it
 
05:05:26.470 --> 05:05:26.480 align:start position:0%
shows evidence of delimination on the
 
05:05:28.868 --> 05:05:28.878 align:start position:0%
friction surface we took out uh
 
05:05:31.590 --> 05:05:31.600 align:start position:0%
extensive pity all right Al
 
05:05:34.350 --> 05:05:34.360 align:start position:0%
together those were the changes uh from
 
05:05:34.360 --> 05:05:38.590 align:start position:0%
together those were the changes uh from
this

05:05:38.590 --> 05:05:38.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:42.628 --> 05:05:42.638 align:start position:0%
morning thank you sir um let me just
 
05:05:45.270 --> 05:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
clarify a couple of things um the only
 
05:05:47.030 --> 05:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
one I'll mention at this point in terms
 
05:05:50.270 --> 05:05:50.280 align:start position:0%
of the fogging that was added fogging
 
05:05:53.590 --> 05:05:53.600 align:start position:0%
in clouding or oxidizing
 
05:05:56.548 --> 05:05:56.558 align:start position:0%
um just about well usually it's on the
 
05:05:58.750 --> 05:05:58.760 align:start position:0%
exterior because of sun damage uh but I
 
05:06:00.110 --> 05:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
do not know of an inspection station
 
05:06:01.590 --> 05:06:01.600 align:start position:0%
that does not have a rubbing compound
 
05:06:03.510 --> 05:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
and that's usually the solution uh
 
05:06:05.470 --> 05:06:05.480 align:start position:0%
within five minutes they can polish it
 
05:06:07.670 --> 05:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
back to clear no failure but at least
 
05:06:09.750 --> 05:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
it's back to bright light again so just
 
05:06:11.628 --> 05:06:11.638 align:start position:0%
to explain what the solution is that's
 
05:06:12.910 --> 05:06:12.920 align:start position:0%
why it's not going to
 
05:06:15.070 --> 05:06:15.080 align:start position:0%
fail um I will say there was a
 
05:06:16.788 --> 05:06:16.798 align:start position:0%
conversation about the
 
05:06:20.230 --> 05:06:20.240 align:start position:0%
inspections versus a 20-day plate I
 
05:06:22.310 --> 05:06:22.320 align:start position:0%
can't solidify any direct problem right
 
05:06:23.510 --> 05:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
now I'm just letting you know some of
 
05:06:25.150 --> 05:06:25.160 align:start position:0%
the things were brought up um when we
 
05:06:27.548 --> 05:06:27.558 align:start position:0%
were speaking a minute ago uh in other
 
05:06:29.670 --> 05:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
words a 30-day grace period for a 20-day
 
05:06:31.990 --> 05:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
plate there may or may not be something
 
05:06:33.830 --> 05:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
certainly nothing needs to stop us for
 
05:06:35.830 --> 05:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
moving forward with this today obviously
 
05:06:37.590 --> 05:06:37.600 align:start position:0%
there's be opportunities if we find it's
 
05:06:37.600 --> 05:06:38.510 align:start position:0%
there's be opportunities if we find it's
a

05:06:38.510 --> 05:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:06:38.520 --> 05:06:40.310 align:start position:0%
a
problem

05:06:40.310 --> 05:06:40.320 align:start position:0%
problem
 
05:06:43.070 --> 05:06:43.080 align:start position:0%
and other than that I'll open it up to
 
05:06:47.190 --> 05:06:47.200 align:start position:0%
anybody else any other
 
05:06:47.200 --> 05:06:48.868 align:start position:0%
anybody else any other
questions

05:06:48.868 --> 05:06:48.878 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:06:52.830 --> 05:06:52.840 align:start position:0%
really oh go ahead on that on that 20
 
05:06:54.990 --> 05:06:55.000 align:start position:0%
20-day plate it there is it's there is a
 
05:06:57.070 --> 05:06:57.080 align:start position:0%
little difference there so On's if a
 
05:07:00.470 --> 05:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
20-day plate was issued versus if a
 
05:07:03.670 --> 05:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
sticker was already on the vehicle you
 
05:07:05.270 --> 05:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
know at that point so there is a slight
 
05:07:05.280 --> 05:07:07.310 align:start position:0%
know at that point so there is a slight
difference

05:07:07.310 --> 05:07:07.320 align:start position:0%
difference
 
05:07:09.390 --> 05:07:09.400 align:start position:0%
so yeah it may be fine I'm just letting
 
05:07:10.670 --> 05:07:10.680 align:start position:0%
you you know what was brought up as a
 
05:07:12.830 --> 05:07:12.840 align:start position:0%
possible point to which we can handle
 
05:07:14.548 --> 05:07:14.558 align:start position:0%
later if need be but I think we're going
 
05:07:15.868 --> 05:07:15.878 align:start position:0%
to be okay the way it
 
05:07:20.110 --> 05:07:20.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:22.150 --> 05:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
committee representative Hill I Just
 
05:07:23.750 --> 05:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
Want to Thank John it there a lot of
 
05:07:26.948 --> 05:07:26.958 align:start position:0%
work here and you you uh hung in there
 
05:07:28.590 --> 05:07:28.600 align:start position:0%
thanks a
 
05:07:31.030 --> 05:07:31.040 align:start position:0%
lot yes I agree thank you very much
 
05:07:33.750 --> 05:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
again I I hate to say
 
05:07:37.708 --> 05:07:37.718 align:start position:0%
this page four line
 
05:07:40.470 --> 05:07:40.480 align:start position:0%
two show evidence of the elimination on
 
05:07:42.628 --> 05:07:42.638 align:start position:0%
the friction
 
05:07:44.948 --> 05:07:44.958 align:start position:0%
surface I know we said to remove the
 
05:07:48.830 --> 05:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
word ex extensive but we remove the word
 
05:07:52.350 --> 05:07:52.360 align:start position:0%
pitting as well do we want to leave that
 
05:07:54.868 --> 05:07:54.878 align:start position:0%
alone or do we want to read the word
 
05:07:58.430 --> 05:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
pitting just throwing that out
 
05:08:02.070 --> 05:08:02.080 align:start position:0%
there go ahead Mr chair when I was over
 
05:08:05.350 --> 05:08:05.360 align:start position:0%
at OLS we came up with the trying to
 
05:08:07.430 --> 05:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
figure out another word for extensive
 
05:08:09.470 --> 05:08:09.480 align:start position:0%
another word for pitting and it just
 
05:08:11.910 --> 05:08:11.920 align:start position:0%
seem to be you know there's no easy way
 
05:08:16.030 --> 05:08:16.040 align:start position:0%
to describe the surface you know enough
 
05:08:18.708 --> 05:08:18.718 align:start position:0%
to say well is it two or three pits or
 
05:08:21.628 --> 05:08:21.638 align:start position:0%
is it 35 pits you know you know it's
 
05:08:23.390 --> 05:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
it's you know so we we just figured
 
05:08:24.990 --> 05:08:25.000 align:start position:0%
maybe leaving it out would probably be
 
05:08:26.470 --> 05:08:26.480 align:start position:0%
best all
 
05:08:28.548 --> 05:08:28.558 align:start position:0%
together I'm fine with that would you
 
05:08:33.030 --> 05:08:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:35.948 --> 05:08:35.958 align:start position:0%
SES I think relative this to this
 
05:08:38.230 --> 05:08:38.240 align:start position:0%
question um I want to do a little bit
 
05:08:40.628 --> 05:08:40.638 align:start position:0%
more research and maybe we can if it
 
05:08:43.150 --> 05:08:43.160 align:start position:0%
does need to be changed back a little
 
05:08:46.150 --> 05:08:46.160 align:start position:0%
bit uh we can cooperate on a floor
 
05:08:50.590 --> 05:08:50.600 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh or I like to keep things
 
05:08:53.548 --> 05:08:53.558 align:start position:0%
within our control if we can um and if
 
05:08:57.708 --> 05:08:57.718 align:start position:0%
it doesn't so I I I I don't see that one
 
05:08:59.868 --> 05:08:59.878 align:start position:0%
little thing as being sufficient enough
 
05:09:02.750 --> 05:09:02.760 align:start position:0%
for us not to move forward um but we
 
05:09:05.070 --> 05:09:05.080 align:start position:0%
will do a little bit of work about that
 
05:09:07.430 --> 05:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
I'll do a little bit of work about that
 
05:09:10.430 --> 05:09:10.440 align:start position:0%
and consult with everyone about uh
 
05:09:12.548 --> 05:09:12.558 align:start position:0%
whether we need a floor Amendment for
 
05:09:12.558 --> 05:09:14.150 align:start position:0%
whether we need a floor Amendment for
Thursday

05:09:14.150 --> 05:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
Thursday
 
05:09:16.470 --> 05:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
okay uh well it wouldn't be this coming
 
05:09:18.150 --> 05:09:18.160 align:start position:0%
Thursday anyway which is good so it
 
05:09:24.350 --> 05:09:24.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:26.470 --> 05:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
anyway I believe you are right so that
 
05:09:29.150 --> 05:09:29.160 align:start position:0%
could give us we have plenty of time and
 
05:09:30.270 --> 05:09:30.280 align:start position:0%
and so you know there's going to be a
 
05:09:32.470 --> 05:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
couple because this is fresh and I do
 
05:09:33.948 --> 05:09:33.958 align:start position:0%
agree with ranking member that we
 
05:09:37.310 --> 05:09:37.320 align:start position:0%
usually do keep things here um we do
 
05:09:39.628 --> 05:09:39.638 align:start position:0%
have options if we did over look
 
05:09:41.788 --> 05:09:41.798 align:start position:0%
anything but I agree it's nothing worth
 
05:09:43.548 --> 05:09:43.558 align:start position:0%
holding back on moving
 
05:09:48.070 --> 05:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
forward yeah anybody else on the
 
05:09:51.310 --> 05:09:51.320 align:start position:0%
amendment seeing none all those in favor
 
05:09:55.670 --> 05:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
of adopting Amendment 2024
 
05:09:58.670 --> 05:09:58.680 align:start position:0%
1222 raise your
 
05:10:02.030 --> 05:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
hands I and opposed all right so the
 
05:10:08.310 --> 05:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:08.320 --> 05:10:21.230 align:start position:0%
 
190

05:10:21.230 --> 05:10:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:23.190 --> 05:10:23.200 align:start position:0%
okay so our motion on the floor is ought
 
05:10:26.990 --> 05:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
to pass as amended on House Bill 1637
 
05:10:29.470 --> 05:10:29.480 align:start position:0%
any other comments from the
 
05:10:32.830 --> 05:10:32.840 align:start position:0%
committee questions comments seeing none
 
05:10:34.270 --> 05:10:34.280 align:start position:0%
I'll ask the clerk to call the RO when
 
05:10:36.868 --> 05:10:36.878 align:start position:0%
she's ready again the motion is ought to
 
05:10:38.230 --> 05:10:38.240 align:start position:0%
pass as
 
05:10:42.628 --> 05:10:42.638 align:start position:0%

05:11:15.670 --> 05:11:15.680 align:start position:0%
representative Jack yes representative
 
05:11:19.590 --> 05:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
um elberger yes okay and chairman Walsh
 
05:11:23.830 --> 05:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:26.548 --> 05:11:26.558 align:start position:0%
zero I did hear a motion for consent
 
05:11:28.910 --> 05:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
without objection consent it'll be our
 
05:11:31.230 --> 05:11:31.240 align:start position:0%
committee recommendation is adopted
 
05:11:31.240 --> 05:11:33.030 align:start position:0%
committee recommendation is adopted
190

05:11:33.030 --> 05:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
190
 
05:11:35.350 --> 05:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
question question about if we put it on
 
05:11:36.868 --> 05:11:36.878 align:start position:0%
consent does that make it more difficult
 
05:11:41.430 --> 05:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:43.990 --> 05:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
okay and if it does for whatever reason
 
05:11:46.750 --> 05:11:46.760 align:start position:0%
I can pull it myself so we we'll leave
 
05:11:49.590 --> 05:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
it on consent um on that being said
 
05:11:51.230 --> 05:11:51.240 align:start position:0%
again thank you representative sellers
 
05:11:52.628 --> 05:11:52.638 align:start position:0%
for listening to all of us and doing all
 
05:11:54.350 --> 05:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
the leg work but thank you everybody
 
05:11:56.430 --> 05:11:56.440 align:start position:0%
else too because we've been spending a
 
05:11:58.750 --> 05:11:58.760 align:start position:0%
good we spent a good portion of this day
 
05:12:00.150 --> 05:12:00.160 align:start position:0%
and the last time we were here talking
 
05:12:02.150 --> 05:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
about this bill so it's good to see
 
05:12:04.430 --> 05:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
something moving in in in the right
 
05:12:08.470 --> 05:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
direction um are we back here next week
 
05:12:09.910 --> 05:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
here's where we're out hold on one
 
05:12:32.590 --> 05:12:32.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:35.868 --> 05:12:35.878 align:start position:0%
deadlines okay so crossover is on April
 
05:12:38.270 --> 05:12:38.280 align:start position:0%
11th so far I've gotten eight bills from
 
05:12:40.510 --> 05:12:40.520 align:start position:0%
the Senate we heard four today and I did
 
05:12:43.230 --> 05:12:43.240 align:start position:0%
that just to basically fill the day uh
 
05:12:45.868 --> 05:12:45.878 align:start position:0%
my plan was to not meet again in the
 
05:12:48.590 --> 05:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
committee until after crossover I I
 
05:12:51.470 --> 05:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
would not like to schedule my last five
 
05:12:53.948 --> 05:12:53.958 align:start position:0%
or four I should say and then find out
 
05:12:55.430 --> 05:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
we get one on crossover and have to come
 
05:12:57.190 --> 05:12:57.200 align:start position:0%
back for one bill so why don't we wait
 
05:12:58.670 --> 05:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
for crossovers to like then I'll
 
05:13:00.670 --> 05:13:00.680 align:start position:0%
reschedule or schedule the rest of our
 
05:13:03.270 --> 05:13:03.280 align:start position:0%
Senate bills um hopefully we don't get
 
05:13:06.548 --> 05:13:06.558 align:start position:0%
anymore so let's cross our fingers uh so
 
05:13:08.190 --> 05:13:08.200 align:start position:0%
that's my plan so I'm thinking we're
 
05:13:08.200 --> 05:13:09.670 align:start position:0%
that's my plan so I'm thinking we're
looking

05:13:09.670 --> 05:13:09.680 align:start position:0%
looking
 
05:13:11.310 --> 05:13:11.320 align:start position:0%
middle of April before we come back
 
05:13:15.548 --> 05:13:15.558 align:start position:0%
sometime uh so you know we have
 
05:13:17.670 --> 05:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
until May
 
05:13:21.350 --> 05:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
23rd so we've got plenty of time we got
 
05:13:22.470 --> 05:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
plenty go
 
05:13:24.910 --> 05:13:24.920 align:start position:0%
Ahad if that school vacation week is the
 
05:13:27.310 --> 05:13:27.320 align:start position:0%
last week of April April 22nd so that
 
05:13:28.990 --> 05:13:29.000 align:start position:0%
week if there's possibility of not being
 
05:13:30.910 --> 05:13:30.920 align:start position:0%
committee that week that would be
 
05:13:32.868 --> 05:13:32.878 align:start position:0%
helpful to some that's fine too we can
 
05:13:35.310 --> 05:13:35.320 align:start position:0%
stretch it even longer again we've got
 
05:13:37.868 --> 05:13:37.878 align:start position:0%
till May May 23rd report I don't want to
 
05:13:39.750 --> 05:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
wait that long but it's not like we're
 
05:13:41.270 --> 05:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
under the gun by any stretch we got
 
05:13:44.830 --> 05:13:44.840 align:start position:0%

05:13:47.670 --> 05:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
