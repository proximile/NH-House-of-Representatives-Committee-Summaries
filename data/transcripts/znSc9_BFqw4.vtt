00:26:57.289 --> 00:26:57.299 align:start position:0%
and the citizens of New Hampshire
 
00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:01.020 align:start position:0%
on May 3rd 2023 it will Mark the 20th
 
00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:03.240 align:start position:0%
year since the old man and the mountain
 
00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:05.090 align:start position:0%
year since the old man and the mountain
collapsed

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:05.100 align:start position:0%
collapsed
 
00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
I remember getting the news from home
 
00:27:10.669 --> 00:27:10.679 align:start position:0%
Grandma grant called us
 
00:27:12.529 --> 00:27:12.539 align:start position:0%
to tell us the news
 
00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
it was a sad day
 
00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:17.220 align:start position:0%
I remember making the journey to see the
 
00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:19.980 align:start position:0%
old man when I was a kid
 
00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:22.740 align:start position:0%
my father took me there
 
00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:26.100 align:start position:0%
nothing is more Granite State
 
00:27:30.049 --> 00:27:30.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
reading about a father and son team that
 
00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:35.100 align:start position:0%
worked to keep the old man together was
 
00:27:39.769 --> 00:27:39.779 align:start position:0%
an inspiring story when I was younger
 
00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
they climbed out on the rocks and Ledges
 
00:27:44.269 --> 00:27:44.279 align:start position:0%
working to keep the old man in the
 
00:27:45.289 --> 00:27:45.299 align:start position:0%
mountain together
 
00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
so that everyone could enjoy him
 
00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
that was inspiring
 
00:27:53.810 --> 00:27:53.820 align:start position:0%
for years David Nielsen and his father
 
00:27:56.269 --> 00:27:56.279 align:start position:0%
worked to preserve the old man every
 
00:27:56.279 --> 00:27:57.590 align:start position:0%
worked to preserve the old man every
year

00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:27:59.870 --> 00:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
risking their lives so that the New
 
00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would still have its mascot
 
00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
The Old Man of the Mountain
 
00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
so we the people could still have our
 
00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:11.100 align:start position:0%
iconic symbol
 
00:28:14.149 --> 00:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
they embody the best of the Granite
 
00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:17.400 align:start position:0%
State Live Free or Die
 
00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
when the old man fell
 
00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
then Governor Benson was right when he
 
00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:22.970 align:start position:0%
then Governor Benson was right when he
said

00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:22.980 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
the old man falling was akin to the Twin
 
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.130 align:start position:0%
the old man falling was akin to the Twin
Towers

00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:31.140 align:start position:0%
Towers
 
00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
for many of the Granite State and around
 
00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:35.940 align:start position:0%
the world
 
00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:40.140 align:start position:0%
I was in DC on September 11th
 
00:28:45.529 --> 00:28:45.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
soon after that I made up my mind that I
 
00:28:49.549 --> 00:28:49.559 align:start position:0%
wanted to come back home to New
 
00:28:49.559 --> 00:28:50.870 align:start position:0%
wanted to come back home to New
Hampshire

00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:28:53.269 --> 00:28:53.279 align:start position:0%

00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
chambers before all of you
 
00:28:57.830 --> 00:28:57.840 align:start position:0%

00:28:59.870 --> 00:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
so what do we do now
 
00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:02.400 align:start position:0%
this is what we do now
 
00:29:04.669 --> 00:29:04.679 align:start position:0%
what an amazing way we can promote and
 
00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:07.620 align:start position:0%
remember Granite State's iconic mascot
 
00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:09.900 align:start position:0%
whose likeness appears everywhere and on
 
00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
everything in New Hampshire
 
00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:14.580 align:start position:0%
from our money our t-shirts our bumper
 
00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:16.320 align:start position:0%

plates the old man is everywhere the old
 
00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:22.980 align:start position:0%
man is New Hampshire
 
00:29:25.149 --> 00:29:25.159 align:start position:0%
this is the answer to Benson's question
 
00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:27.720 align:start position:0%
this is what we do now
 
00:29:30.649 --> 00:29:30.659 align:start position:0%
I ask you to vote ought to pass on HB 96
 
00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
and join me in honoring the Old Man of
 
00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:44.810 --> 00:29:44.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:51.720 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:29:56.889 --> 00:29:56.899 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker the old man in the mountain
 
00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:01.740 align:start position:0%
is the iconic symbol of New Hampshire
 
00:30:05.049 --> 00:30:05.059 align:start position:0%
it was featured on a three cent stamp
 
00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:10.020 align:start position:0%
back in the 1950s I have a collection of
 
00:30:11.630 --> 00:30:11.640 align:start position:0%
them because my dad was a stamp
 
00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:12.950 align:start position:0%
them because my dad was a stamp
collector

00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
collector
 
00:30:15.769 --> 00:30:15.779 align:start position:0%
and there is a plate block of that same
 
00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
stamp down in the visitor center for
 
00:30:20.389 --> 00:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
those of you who might want to look at
 
00:30:20.399 --> 00:30:21.529 align:start position:0%
those of you who might want to look at
it

00:30:21.529 --> 00:30:21.539 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:30:24.649 --> 00:30:24.659 align:start position:0%
it's also on the 2000
 
00:30:24.659 --> 00:30:26.570 align:start position:0%
it's also on the 2000
quarter

00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:26.580 align:start position:0%
quarter
 
00:30:33.250 --> 00:30:33.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:38.149 --> 00:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
sponsored by a good friend HCR
 
00:30:42.649 --> 00:30:42.659 align:start position:0%
13 in 1999
 
00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:44.940 align:start position:0%
a resolution urging the selection of a
 
00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:46.200 align:start position:0%
final design of the New Hampshire
 
00:30:48.289 --> 00:30:48.299 align:start position:0%
commemorative quarter which includes the
 
00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
state motto Live Free or Die Nine Stars
 
00:30:53.570 --> 00:30:53.580 align:start position:0%
representing New Hampshire as the ninth
 
00:30:55.850 --> 00:30:55.860 align:start position:0%
state to ratify the Constitution
 
00:31:00.169 --> 00:31:00.179 align:start position:0%
and the Old Man of the Mountain
 
00:31:04.909 --> 00:31:04.919 align:start position:0%
had this bill not pass this body
 
00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
the Federal Reserve would have put on
 
00:31:10.549 --> 00:31:10.559 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire quarter whatever they
 
00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:14.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:17.220 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:31:18.769 --> 00:31:18.779 align:start position:0%
I believe
 
00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
is needed
 
00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:23.090 align:start position:0%
is needed
because

00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:23.100 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:31:25.610 --> 00:31:25.620 align:start position:0%
I propose this bill
 
00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:28.260 align:start position:0%
I thought about it for about two years I
 
00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
talked to a bunch of people
 
00:31:34.010 --> 00:31:34.020 align:start position:0%
and I selected four people to co-sponsor
 
00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:31:38.690 --> 00:31:38.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:40.549 --> 00:31:40.559 align:start position:0%
representative shurtliff the former
 
00:31:40.559 --> 00:31:42.289 align:start position:0%
representative shurtliff the former
speaker

00:31:42.289 --> 00:31:42.299 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
Jeb Bradley excuse me
 
00:31:47.029 --> 00:31:47.039 align:start position:0%
two people from the other side of the
 
00:31:49.669 --> 00:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
wall who are in leadership on both sides
 
00:31:51.409 --> 00:31:51.419 align:start position:0%
of the aisle
 
00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
they agreed that it was about time that
 
00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
somebody recognized the Old Man of the
 
00:31:57.840 --> 00:31:59.990 align:start position:0%
somebody recognized the Old Man of the
Mountain

00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:03.240 align:start position:0%
and I've talked to so many people I've
 
00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
gotten so many emails
 
00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:08.940 align:start position:0%
I've talked to constituents in Derry
 
00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:11.940 align:start position:0%
Londonderry Wyndham wherever I visit to
 
00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:14.100 align:start position:0%
do whatever I need to do
 
00:32:18.049 --> 00:32:18.059 align:start position:0%
and they all said it's about time
 
00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
we've let this sit for 20 years
 
00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
and I believe that the 20th anniversary
 
00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:26.820 align:start position:0%
should be a commemorative year
 
00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
the bill itself I don't know if you've
 
00:32:30.889 --> 00:32:30.899 align:start position:0%
read it
 
00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
but the bill States
 
00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:35.700 align:start position:0%
Old Man of the Mountain day the governor
 
00:32:37.789 --> 00:32:37.799 align:start position:0%
shall issue an annual Proclamation
 
00:32:40.789 --> 00:32:40.799 align:start position:0%
calling for the proper observance of May
 
00:32:43.549 --> 00:32:43.559 align:start position:0%
3rd As Old Man of the Mountain day in
 
00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:46.020 align:start position:0%
honor of the day the iconic rock
 
00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
formation collapsed
 
00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
it doesn't ask you to do anything
 
00:32:55.850 --> 00:32:55.860 align:start position:0%
it doesn't require you to do anything
 
00:33:00.190 --> 00:33:00.200 align:start position:0%
it's just a day of remembrance
 
00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:03.240 align:start position:0%
sometime during the day
 
00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
stop and reflect on what the old man
 
00:33:10.010 --> 00:33:10.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:11.269 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:33:11.269 --> 00:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:33:15.529 --> 00:33:15.539 align:start position:0%
I'm asking you to vote no
 
00:33:18.289 --> 00:33:18.299 align:start position:0%
on itl
 
00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:21.240 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
00:33:24.570 --> 00:33:24.580 align:start position:0%
my colleagues and thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:33.289 align:start position:0%
my colleagues and thank you Mr Speaker
[Music]

00:33:33.289 --> 00:33:33.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:36.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker owning a
 
00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:37.980 align:start position:0%
cabin in the White Mountains there are
 
00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
some days that I feel like the Old Man
 
00:33:41.450 --> 00:33:41.460 align:start position:0%
of the Mountain
 
00:33:43.549 --> 00:33:43.559 align:start position:0%
um Mr Speaker I understand the
 
00:33:45.889 --> 00:33:45.899 align:start position:0%
committee's vote on this in Italy at
 
00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:48.120 align:start position:0%
every session they get bills to
 
00:33:50.509 --> 00:33:50.519 align:start position:0%
recognize uh distinguished people from
 
00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:52.860 align:start position:0%
the granite state with a permanent day
 
00:33:55.669 --> 00:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
but this bill is somewhat unique
 
00:33:57.889 --> 00:33:57.899 align:start position:0%
in so far we're not talking about a
 
00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
person we're talking about a symbol
 
00:34:03.649 --> 00:34:03.659 align:start position:0%
and that is not just my opinion that the
 
00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:07.740 align:start position:0%
old man is assembled in 1945 legislators
 
00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
sitting in this Hall voted
 
00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:12.780 align:start position:0%
to name The Old Man of the Mountain the
 
00:34:15.889 --> 00:34:15.899 align:start position:0%
official symbol of the Granite State and
 
00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:17.820 align:start position:0%
that's why today we still see the
 
00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:20.700 align:start position:0%
profile of the old man on Department of
 
00:34:22.909 --> 00:34:22.919 align:start position:0%
Transportation signs
 
00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:24.780 align:start position:0%
I know we got a long day so I'm going to
 
00:34:26.329 --> 00:34:26.339 align:start position:0%
cut this shot I'm not going to talk
 
00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:28.740 align:start position:0%
about Nathaniel Hawthorne's wonderful
 
00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:31.329 align:start position:0%

00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
The Great Stone phrase I'm not going to
 
00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
talk about Daniel Webster's outstanding
 
00:34:38.329 --> 00:34:38.339 align:start position:0%
quote about what the man on the mountain
 
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
stands for in that symbolism
 
00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
let me tell you a story instead now the
 
00:34:46.849 --> 00:34:46.859 align:start position:0%
Old Man of the Mountain is recognized by
 
00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:49.560 align:start position:0%
both the Abenaki Indians in the Mohawk
 
00:34:51.950 --> 00:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
Indians with great reverence
 
00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:55.020 align:start position:0%
and there's a story in Abernathy law or
 
00:34:56.810 --> 00:34:56.820 align:start position:0%
about a great Chief named premature
 
00:34:59.690 --> 00:34:59.700 align:start position:0%
wassid and he fell in love with a
 
00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
beautiful Native American Woman by the
 
00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:06.060 align:start position:0%
name of Manawa whose father was the
 
00:35:09.109 --> 00:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
chief of the Mohawk Tribe they married
 
00:35:11.450 --> 00:35:11.460 align:start position:0%
and because of that Union for years
 
00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:13.500 align:start position:0%
there was peace between
 
00:35:17.329 --> 00:35:17.339 align:start position:0%
the warring Mohawks in the abenakis
 
00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
one day menowa got a message from her
 
00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
father saying I'm dying of an illness
 
00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:25.560 align:start position:0%

me

00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
before I die
 
00:35:31.490 --> 00:35:31.500 align:start position:0%
and she told premature was that I will
 
00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
return just as quickly as I can
 
00:35:36.730 --> 00:35:36.740 align:start position:0%
and chief Pember johas had told her
 
00:35:40.010 --> 00:35:40.020 align:start position:0%
every night that you're gone on top of
 
00:35:42.349 --> 00:35:42.359 align:start position:0%
what is now Canon Mountain I will light
 
00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
a bonfire
 
00:35:46.270 --> 00:35:46.280 align:start position:0%
so that when you return to our village
 
00:35:48.829 --> 00:35:48.839 align:start position:0%
if you do so at the night in the night
 
00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
time you'll be able to find your way
 
00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
back to me
 
00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
and every night Chief image Owasso
 
00:35:57.470 --> 00:35:57.480 align:start position:0%
climbed cannon in lit that bonfire for
 
00:35:59.750 --> 00:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
his wife menewa
 
00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
one night his brother approached him
 
00:36:04.069 --> 00:36:04.079 align:start position:0%
climbed the mountain said
 
00:36:07.069 --> 00:36:07.079 align:start position:0%
I've got bad news we have just learned
 
00:36:09.109 --> 00:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
that your wife died of the same disease
 
00:36:11.450 --> 00:36:11.460 align:start position:0%
that killed her father
 
00:36:13.370 --> 00:36:13.380 align:start position:0%
and as the brother started down the
 
00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:16.200 align:start position:0%
trail from Canon he turned around to see
 
00:36:18.770 --> 00:36:18.780 align:start position:0%
a temperature was it was following him
 
00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:21.720 align:start position:0%
and where there had been a bonfire
 
00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:25.140 align:start position:0%
there was now a great Stone Face the old
 
00:36:27.170 --> 00:36:27.180 align:start position:0%
man on the mountain
 
00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:30.720 align:start position:0%
the great spirit turned pimaja wasset
 
00:36:33.470 --> 00:36:33.480 align:start position:0%
into the old man and had him facing
 
00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
towards the trail that meant a while
 
00:36:37.609 --> 00:36:37.619 align:start position:0%
would come back when she returned to
 
00:36:39.650 --> 00:36:39.660 align:start position:0%
premature Lawson
 
00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:42.420 align:start position:0%
you know on May 3rd when I heard of 19
 
00:36:45.410 --> 00:36:45.420 align:start position:0%
in 2003 that the old man had fallen
 
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
I thought back to that story I had heard
 
00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:49.800 align:start position:0%
years ago and I wondered does this mean
 
00:36:51.170 --> 00:36:51.180 align:start position:0%
the middlewa
 
00:36:53.210 --> 00:36:53.220 align:start position:0%
in premature was that were finally
 
00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:54.589 align:start position:0%
in premature was that were finally
United

00:36:54.589 --> 00:36:54.599 align:start position:0%
United
 
00:36:56.690 --> 00:36:56.700 align:start position:0%
The Old Man of the Mountain is a very
 
00:36:59.270 --> 00:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
iconic representation of the Granite
 
00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:00.230 align:start position:0%
iconic representation of the Granite
State

00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
State
 
00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
it's important
 
00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
and I asked you to overturn the itl so
 
00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
another motion could be made
 
00:37:09.170 --> 00:37:09.180 align:start position:0%
I would like to see a permanent day
 
00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
dedicated to the old man on the mountain
 
00:37:14.450 --> 00:37:14.460 align:start position:0%
so the future Generations will stop and
 
00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
pause and think what the great Stone
 
00:37:20.329 --> 00:37:20.339 align:start position:0%
Face Metro State not just to the early
 
00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
settlers but to our Native American
 
00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:25.020 align:start position:0%
population so I would ask you to please
 
00:37:27.890 --> 00:37:27.900 align:start position:0%
vote red on the itl so another motion
 
00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:30.660 align:start position:0%
could be made thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:37:42.290 --> 00:37:42.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:44.270 --> 00:37:44.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:46.440 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker the committee found House
 
00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:49.740 align:start position:0%
Bill 96 inexpedient to legislate
 
00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:51.960 align:start position:0%
because we do not believe that putting a
 
00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
day into statute
 
00:37:57.470 --> 00:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
is the proper way to memorialize any day
 
00:38:00.530 --> 00:38:00.540 align:start position:0%
including the Old Man of the Mountain
 
00:38:03.589 --> 00:38:03.599 align:start position:0%
this year is the 20th anniversary of the
 
00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
day the Old Man of the Mountain came
 
00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
mumbling down the mountain
 
00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
placed in the day in statute will not
 
00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
memorialize the day
 
00:38:15.470 --> 00:38:15.480 align:start position:0%
what will memorialize the day is the
 
00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:17.940 align:start position:0%
famous Granite face of the famous
 
00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:20.220 align:start position:0%
Granite face is that New Hampshire
 
00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
citizens will choose to gather
 
00:38:24.890 --> 00:38:24.900 align:start position:0%
and to celebrate and to honor the
 
00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:27.290 align:start position:0%
and to celebrate and to honor the
tradition

00:38:27.290 --> 00:38:27.300 align:start position:0%
tradition
 
00:38:29.329 --> 00:38:29.339 align:start position:0%
in closing
 
00:38:31.130 --> 00:38:31.140 align:start position:0%
please allow me to quote from one of the
 
00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:35.640 align:start position:0%
greatest British Bohemian disco bands
 
00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:38.460 align:start position:0%
of all time
 
00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:41.750 align:start position:0%
of all time

00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:44.640 align:start position:0%
yes that Granite face was sadly caught
 
00:38:46.970 --> 00:38:46.980 align:start position:0%
in a landslide
 
00:38:49.069 --> 00:38:49.079 align:start position:0%

of itl
 
00:38:55.250 --> 00:38:55.260 align:start position:0%
because I do not believe we need that
 
00:38:57.410 --> 00:38:57.420 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we need a statute in the
 
00:39:01.849 --> 00:39:01.859 align:start position:0%
irsas to remind us when to celebrate
 
00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:04.200 align:start position:0%
and I remind everyone that without there
 
00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:07.320 align:start position:0%
being a statute in New Hampshire law
 
00:39:09.530 --> 00:39:09.540 align:start position:0%
for anyone who wishes to keep alive the
 
00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
remembrance and the history of that
 
00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:14.640 align:start position:0%

00:39:29.690 --> 00:39:29.700 align:start position:0%
a division has been requested members
 
00:40:24.530 --> 00:40:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:26.569 --> 00:40:26.579 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is majority
 
00:40:28.310 --> 00:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
committed a report of in expedient to
 
00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
legislate on House Bill 96. this is a
 
00:40:32.810 --> 00:40:32.820 align:start position:0%
division vote
 
00:40:34.370 --> 00:40:34.380 align:start position:0%
the chair recognized representative
 
00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
as a longtime member of Edna a committee
 
00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:48.720 align:start position:0%
which is predisposed to deny codifying
 
00:40:52.490 --> 00:40:52.500 align:start position:0%
every person day or Critter that is
 
00:40:55.010 --> 00:40:55.020 align:start position:0%
brought to the legislature I usually
 
00:40:57.589 --> 00:40:57.599 align:start position:0%
agree with that philosophy
 
00:41:00.530 --> 00:41:00.540 align:start position:0%
but if I know a bipartisan minority of
 
00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:03.480 align:start position:0%
our committee including myself believes
 
00:41:05.690 --> 00:41:05.700 align:start position:0%
that this bill should be the exception
 
00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:07.800 align:start position:0%
to that standard
 
00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
and if I know that certain dates like
 
00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
December 7th or 9 11 are dates that
 
00:41:18.349 --> 00:41:18.359 align:start position:0%
stand out in our national history
 
00:41:21.230 --> 00:41:21.240 align:start position:0%
and believe in acting this bill would be
 
00:41:24.589 --> 00:41:24.599 align:start position:0%
the surest way to ensure that May 3rd
 
00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:27.480 align:start position:0%
will be remembered by Future Generations
 
00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:31.500 align:start position:0%
in our state as the date we lost our
 
00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:33.240 align:start position:0%
most famous icon
 
00:41:35.930 --> 00:41:35.940 align:start position:0%
what I then don't know on this itl
 
00:41:38.329 --> 00:41:38.339 align:start position:0%
motion so that another motion may be
 
00:41:41.210 --> 00:41:41.220 align:start position:0%
brought forward thank you
 
00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
I recognize representative goalie for a
 
00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:50.930 --> 00:41:50.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
00:41:54.650 --> 00:41:54.660 align:start position:0%
know the Edna committee heard numerous
 
00:41:58.130 --> 00:41:58.140 align:start position:0%
bills already this year on naming days
 
00:42:00.290 --> 00:42:00.300 align:start position:0%
and had those in in
 
00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
itl those bills so that with the surmise
 
00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:07.020 align:start position:0%
that those individuals who came forward
 
00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
reach out to the governor for their
 
00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
cause on a yearly basis to keep it going
 
00:42:15.770 --> 00:42:15.780 align:start position:0%
and if I know just putting into statute
 
00:42:18.109 --> 00:42:18.119 align:start position:0%
where it'll be with the other 28 days
 
00:42:18.119 --> 00:42:19.550 align:start position:0%
where it'll be with the other 28 days
that

00:42:19.550 --> 00:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:42:22.310 --> 00:42:22.320 align:start position:0%
I couldn't read off the top of my head
 
00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:25.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:26.750 align:start position:0%
 
then

00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:28.500 align:start position:0%
as a matter of fairness to those
 
00:42:30.170 --> 00:42:30.180 align:start position:0%
organizations that we have said in this
 
00:42:33.170 --> 00:42:33.180 align:start position:0%
body has said no to in naming days
 
00:42:34.849 --> 00:42:34.859 align:start position:0%
would I do the same
 
00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:36.660 align:start position:0%
and support the committee report of
 
00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislative thank you

presents these Provisions also represent
 
00:52:25.790 --> 00:52:25.800 align:start position:0%
a massive government overreach to

00:54:34.790 --> 00:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
the latest version of hb10 a parental
 
00:54:37.549 --> 00:54:37.559 align:start position:0%
Bill of Rights for the citizens of New
 
00:54:39.829 --> 00:54:39.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has been finalized
 
00:54:44.030 --> 00:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
as floor Amendment 1146 h
 
00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
it is the product of countless hours of
 
00:54:50.650 --> 00:54:50.660 align:start position:0%
research consultation listening
 
00:54:54.530 --> 00:54:54.540 align:start position:0%
discussion and changes
 
00:54:57.470 --> 00:54:57.480 align:start position:0%
that have been made for a bill
 
00:55:02.750 --> 00:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
and it's for a bill which identifies and
 
00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
secures certain fundamental and vitally
 
00:55:09.109 --> 00:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
important natural and inalienable rights
 
00:55:11.210 --> 00:55:11.220 align:start position:0%
parents have for the bringing up of
 
00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
their children with special focus on
 
00:55:16.370 --> 00:55:16.380 align:start position:0%
education and Medical Care
 
00:55:19.130 --> 00:55:19.140 align:start position:0%
these natural rights are also historic
 
00:55:21.770 --> 00:55:21.780 align:start position:0%
rights that have been acknowledged for
 
00:55:24.109 --> 00:55:24.119 align:start position:0%
centuries across many cultures in the
 
00:55:25.849 --> 00:55:25.859 align:start position:0%
world around
 
00:55:28.370 --> 00:55:28.380 align:start position:0%
however more recently they have come
 
00:55:31.849 --> 00:55:31.859 align:start position:0%
under grave threat in our country
 
00:55:34.430 --> 00:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
hence the need to address and correct
 
00:55:37.010 --> 00:55:37.020 align:start position:0%
imbalances that have become all too
 
00:55:40.630 --> 00:55:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:42.950 --> 00:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
imbalances that are not only the result
 
00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
of mistakes or oversights but also a
 
00:55:49.790 --> 00:55:49.800 align:start position:0%
growing and serious misunderstanding of
 
00:55:51.650 --> 00:55:51.660 align:start position:0%
the two most significant trusts that
 
00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
exists between parents on the one hand
 
00:55:56.990 --> 00:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
and their trustees Educators and medical
 
00:55:59.809 --> 00:55:59.819 align:start position:0%
care providers on the other
 
00:56:02.329 --> 00:56:02.339 align:start position:0%
hb10 with this amendment not only
 
00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
enumerates certain parental rights but
 
00:56:08.990 --> 00:56:09.000 align:start position:0%
serves to inform and assist Educators in
 
00:56:10.849 --> 00:56:10.859 align:start position:0%
medical care providers
 
00:56:13.609 --> 00:56:13.619 align:start position:0%
as to their responsibilities towards the
 
00:56:15.470 --> 00:56:15.480 align:start position:0%
parents whose children have been
 
00:56:17.329 --> 00:56:17.339 align:start position:0%
entrusted to them for particular
 
00:56:17.339 --> 00:56:19.490 align:start position:0%
entrusted to them for particular
purposes

00:56:19.490 --> 00:56:19.500 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
00:56:21.770 --> 00:56:21.780 align:start position:0%
hb10 with this amendment makes clear
 
00:56:24.290 --> 00:56:24.300 align:start position:0%
what natural law recognizes in our
 
00:56:26.569 --> 00:56:26.579 align:start position:0%
nation's courts
 
00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
have a firm time and time again
 
00:56:34.430 --> 00:56:34.440 align:start position:0%
absent extraordinary circumstances
 
00:56:37.130 --> 00:56:37.140 align:start position:0%
the natural order of Life prescribes
 
00:56:39.410 --> 00:56:39.420 align:start position:0%
that parents must be recognized and
 
00:56:41.630 --> 00:56:41.640 align:start position:0%
respected in the raising of their
 
00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:42.530 align:start position:0%
respected in the raising of their
children

00:56:42.530 --> 00:56:42.540 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:56:46.370 --> 00:56:46.380 align:start position:0%
the health vitality and future of our
 
00:56:49.549 --> 00:56:49.559 align:start position:0%
state nation and Any Nation depend upon
 
00:56:52.250 --> 00:56:52.260 align:start position:0%
how well we honor and advance
 
00:56:55.370 --> 00:56:55.380 align:start position:0%
this essential tenet
 
00:56:58.490 --> 00:56:58.500 align:start position:0%
so therefore absent any compelling State
 
00:57:01.190 --> 00:57:01.200 align:start position:0%
interest the right of parents to
 
00:57:03.109 --> 00:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
determine the educations in health care
 
00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
of their children is primary
 
00:57:08.870 --> 00:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
this means parents have a right to know
 
00:57:11.930 --> 00:57:11.940 align:start position:0%
what their children are being taught how
 
00:57:13.910 --> 00:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
they are conducting themselves when at
 
00:57:16.490 --> 00:57:16.500 align:start position:0%
school and the ways they are being
 
00:57:19.250 --> 00:57:19.260 align:start position:0%
treated by ones who stand in a de facto
 
00:57:21.230 --> 00:57:21.240 align:start position:0%
and professionally determined
 
00:57:23.750 --> 00:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
relationship of what is both an implied
 
00:57:26.390 --> 00:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
and an expressed Trust
 
00:57:28.430 --> 00:57:28.440 align:start position:0%
in an earlier time there was a general
 
00:57:31.130 --> 00:57:31.140 align:start position:0%
consensus as to the role of Educators in
 
00:57:33.170 --> 00:57:33.180 align:start position:0%
medical care providers
 
00:57:37.450 --> 00:57:37.460 align:start position:0%
but nowadays this consensus is fractured
 
00:57:40.490 --> 00:57:40.500 align:start position:0%
hb10 with this amendment has been made
 
00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:42.109 align:start position:0%
hb10 with this amendment has been made
necessary

00:57:42.109 --> 00:57:42.119 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
00:57:44.510 --> 00:57:44.520 align:start position:0%
by the teaching of curricula and
 
00:57:47.210 --> 00:57:47.220 align:start position:0%
practices that far too many professional
 
00:57:50.270 --> 00:57:50.280 align:start position:0%
Educators wrongly believe is protected
 
00:57:53.390 --> 00:57:53.400 align:start position:0%
against parental inquiry
 
00:57:56.150 --> 00:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
the assertion and practice of such a
 
00:57:58.910 --> 00:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
presumptive belief has no basis in
 
00:58:00.770 --> 00:58:00.780 align:start position:0%
nature or natural law
 
00:58:03.549 --> 00:58:03.559 align:start position:0%
therefore it cannot be permitted to go
 
00:58:06.589 --> 00:58:06.599 align:start position:0%
unaddressed by the law
 
00:58:09.609 --> 00:58:09.619 align:start position:0%
hb10 with this amendment is reasonable
 
00:58:11.930 --> 00:58:11.940 align:start position:0%
carefully measured
 
00:58:14.089 --> 00:58:14.099 align:start position:0%
and prudent
 
00:58:16.730 --> 00:58:16.740 align:start position:0%
it recognizes and safeguards against
 
00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
potential misuse of any of the rights it
 
00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:21.589 align:start position:0%
potential misuse of any of the rights it
contains

00:58:21.589 --> 00:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
contains
 
00:58:24.290 --> 00:58:24.300 align:start position:0%
not one person who supports this bill
 
00:58:27.290 --> 00:58:27.300 align:start position:0%
wants for any parent child and family to
 
00:58:29.390 --> 00:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
be anything other than helped by its
 
00:58:29.400 --> 00:58:30.349 align:start position:0%
be anything other than helped by its
provisions

00:58:30.349 --> 00:58:30.359 align:start position:0%
provisions
 
00:58:34.190 --> 00:58:34.200 align:start position:0%
and that is exactly what it will
 
00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:35.870 align:start position:0%
and that is exactly what it will
accomplish

00:58:35.870 --> 00:58:35.880 align:start position:0%
accomplish
 
00:58:38.930 --> 00:58:38.940 align:start position:0%
HP 10 with this amendment is not a
 
00:58:43.190 --> 00:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
weapon to divide but a tool to unite
 
00:58:46.309 --> 00:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
a tool for parents Educators and Health
 
00:58:48.829 --> 00:58:48.839 align:start position:0%
Care practitioners to more effectively
 
00:58:51.230 --> 00:58:51.240 align:start position:0%
care for the children to which each
 
00:58:54.170 --> 00:58:54.180 align:start position:0%
respectively and specifically has been
 
00:58:54.180 --> 00:58:55.849 align:start position:0%
respectively and specifically has been
entrusted

00:58:55.849 --> 00:58:55.859 align:start position:0%
entrusted
 
00:58:57.230 --> 00:58:57.240 align:start position:0%
out there
 
00:58:58.789 --> 00:58:58.799 align:start position:0%
out there
 
00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
Beyond this hallowed Hall the people of
 
00:59:04.250 --> 00:59:04.260 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire are asking and expecting
 
00:59:06.530 --> 00:59:06.540 align:start position:0%
that we will hear their voices and
 
00:59:08.690 --> 00:59:08.700 align:start position:0%
respond to their desire for a parental
 
00:59:10.490 --> 00:59:10.500 align:start position:0%
Bill of Rights
 
00:59:13.069 --> 00:59:13.079 align:start position:0%
how many people
 
00:59:15.770 --> 00:59:15.780 align:start position:0%
nearly 80 percent according to the most
 
00:59:19.250 --> 00:59:19.260 align:start position:0%
recent Statewide poll on this question
 
00:59:21.650 --> 00:59:21.660 align:start position:0%
80 percent
 
00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
that's not just a majority that's a
 
00:59:29.150 --> 00:59:29.160 align:start position:0%
veritable Avalanche a landslide
 
00:59:32.270 --> 00:59:32.280 align:start position:0%
so let's make sure we deliver for them
 
00:59:35.329 --> 00:59:35.339 align:start position:0%
because if we deliver for them
 
00:59:41.089 --> 00:59:41.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:43.430 --> 00:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
I urge you to vote OTP on the floor
 
00:59:46.930 --> 00:59:46.940 align:start position:0%
Amendment 1146h and then again on hb10
 
00:59:51.230 --> 00:59:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:53.750 --> 00:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
also vegan order the chair recognizes
 
01:00:00.890 --> 01:00:00.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:03.170 --> 01:00:03.180 align:start position:0%
thank you madam speaker I should say
 
01:00:05.809 --> 01:00:05.819 align:start position:0%
that I had not intended to speak on this
 
01:00:09.970 --> 01:00:09.980 align:start position:0%
uh Amendment but I do I do rise to speak
 
01:00:13.130 --> 01:00:13.140 align:start position:0%
and I strongly support it and I think it
 
01:00:15.650 --> 01:00:15.660 align:start position:0%
was the one thing that I want to focus
 
01:00:18.109 --> 01:00:18.119 align:start position:0%
on is the suggestion that somehow
 
01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:20.460 align:start position:0%
adopting this amendment
 
01:00:24.170 --> 01:00:24.180 align:start position:0%
um uh would would permit uh would change
 
01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
the law with respect to uh the abuse and
 
01:00:29.089 --> 01:00:29.099 align:start position:0%
neglect it does not do that in any way
 
01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
the definition of compelling State
 
01:00:33.530 --> 01:00:33.540 align:start position:0%
interest that is contained in this
 
01:00:37.789 --> 01:00:37.799 align:start position:0%
amendment is limited to the is limited
 
01:00:39.650 --> 01:00:39.660 align:start position:0%
to this bill and the rights that are
 
01:00:41.870 --> 01:00:41.880 align:start position:0%
created in this bill and the rights that
 
01:00:45.530 --> 01:00:45.540 align:start position:0%
are created in this bill are our rights
 
01:00:49.069 --> 01:00:49.079 align:start position:0%
to know not rights to abuse if a parent
 
01:00:50.809 --> 01:00:50.819 align:start position:0%
is Abu has abused a child there's
 
01:00:52.549 --> 01:00:52.559 align:start position:0%
nothing in this amendment or this bill
 
01:00:55.490 --> 01:00:55.500 align:start position:0%
proposes to change that so let me just
 
01:00:58.789 --> 01:00:58.799 align:start position:0%
take let me just take one give you one
 
01:01:00.890 --> 01:01:00.900 align:start position:0%
specific example which I think kind of
 
01:01:02.930 --> 01:01:02.940 align:start position:0%
gets at the heart of what people who
 
01:01:05.930 --> 01:01:05.940 align:start position:0%
oppose this are concerned about
 
01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:08.640 align:start position:0%
let's suppose because then this arises
 
01:01:12.370 --> 01:01:12.380 align:start position:0%
in the transgender example let's suppose
 
01:01:15.289 --> 01:01:15.299 align:start position:0%
that a child has made a disclosure to a
 
01:01:17.870 --> 01:01:17.880 align:start position:0%
parent to a teacher that he or she is
 
01:01:19.609 --> 01:01:19.619 align:start position:0%
transitioning and instead of using the
 
01:01:22.010 --> 01:01:22.020 align:start position:0%
name Sam which is the given name of the
 
01:01:24.170 --> 01:01:24.180 align:start position:0%
child the child now wants to be referred
 
01:01:25.910 --> 01:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
to as Sue
 
01:01:29.530 --> 01:01:29.540 align:start position:0%
this amendment says that the the the
 
01:01:32.690 --> 01:01:32.700 align:start position:0%
school cannot keep that information from
 
01:01:35.270 --> 01:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
the parent even if the child says
 
01:01:36.589 --> 01:01:36.599 align:start position:0%
something like
 
01:01:38.990 --> 01:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
my you know if I tell my if I tell my
 
01:01:41.829 --> 01:01:41.839 align:start position:0%
father he'll kill me well if that's if
 
01:01:44.690 --> 01:01:44.700 align:start position:0%
that's what the child says the school
 
01:01:46.789 --> 01:01:46.799 align:start position:0%
certainly has an obligation to go
 
01:01:49.130 --> 01:01:49.140 align:start position:0%
further than that and find out is the
 
01:01:51.650 --> 01:01:51.660 align:start position:0%
child really saying my parent will kill
 
01:01:54.530 --> 01:01:54.540 align:start position:0%
me he really means that and that's what
 
01:01:56.870 --> 01:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
he's talking about or is the child just
 
01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
saying you know if I tell my parent he's
 
01:02:02.930 --> 01:02:02.940 align:start position:0%
going to be very disappointed and angry
 
01:02:05.750 --> 01:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
and upset with me which would not be
 
01:02:08.390 --> 01:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
enough to disclose to fail to disclose
 
01:02:10.970 --> 01:02:10.980 align:start position:0%
to the parent because it's we're not we
 
01:02:13.010 --> 01:02:13.020 align:start position:0%
don't I submit to you we should not be
 
01:02:15.530 --> 01:02:15.540 align:start position:0%
protecting children from the ordinary
 
01:02:17.030 --> 01:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
things in life the ordinary human
 
01:02:19.069 --> 01:02:19.079 align:start position:0%
emotions that parents Express from time
 
01:02:21.650 --> 01:02:21.660 align:start position:0%
to time life is hard sometimes but that
 
01:02:23.930 --> 01:02:23.940 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that parents should be able
 
01:02:25.490 --> 01:02:25.500 align:start position:0%
that schools should be able to keep
 
01:02:27.890 --> 01:02:27.900 align:start position:0%
information from their parents this
 
01:02:30.230 --> 01:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
amendment specifically says that if it's
 
01:02:33.349 --> 01:02:33.359 align:start position:0%
more than If there really is a serious
 
01:02:35.809 --> 01:02:35.819 align:start position:0%
threat to the child either either
 
01:02:39.289 --> 01:02:39.299 align:start position:0%
physically or even psychologically then
 
01:02:41.390 --> 01:02:41.400 align:start position:0%
the state and the school district in my
 
01:02:44.150 --> 01:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
example certainly has to do something
 
01:02:46.309 --> 01:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
they can and there are they are it's
 
01:02:49.490 --> 01:02:49.500 align:start position:0%
specifically authorized by this to go to
 
01:02:51.829 --> 01:02:51.839 align:start position:0%
the appropriate authorities to pursue
 
01:02:54.650 --> 01:02:54.660 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect proceedings but what
 
01:02:56.510 --> 01:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
this says this says that the state
 
01:02:58.970 --> 01:02:58.980 align:start position:0%
cannot do or the school district cannot
 
01:03:02.089 --> 01:03:02.099 align:start position:0%
do in my example is they can't simply
 
01:03:02.099 --> 01:03:04.210 align:start position:0%
do in my example is they can't simply
say

01:03:04.210 --> 01:03:04.220 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:03:06.349 --> 01:03:06.359 align:start position:0%
we're very very concerned that there
 
01:03:08.329 --> 01:03:08.339 align:start position:0%
could actually be some abuse here so
 
01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:09.839 align:start position:0%
what are we going to do about it well
 
01:03:11.630 --> 01:03:11.640 align:start position:0%
the only thing we're going to do about
 
01:03:14.150 --> 01:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
it is not tell the parents we're not
 
01:03:16.549 --> 01:03:16.559 align:start position:0%
going to do anything else now stop and
 
01:03:18.770 --> 01:03:18.780 align:start position:0%
think about that for a minute what is
 
01:03:20.150 --> 01:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
the likelihood that if the school
 
01:03:23.150 --> 01:03:23.160 align:start position:0%
actually took that tact that that would
 
01:03:25.490 --> 01:03:25.500 align:start position:0%
be effective is it really the case that
 
01:03:27.349 --> 01:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
where the teacher in my example that the
 
01:03:29.569 --> 01:03:29.579 align:start position:0%
school has told the teacher
 
01:03:31.250 --> 01:03:31.260 align:start position:0%
um I mean sorry the student has told the
 
01:03:32.930 --> 01:03:32.940 align:start position:0%
teacher you know I'm transitioning and
 
01:03:34.609 --> 01:03:34.619 align:start position:0%
I'm using the names I want to use the
 
01:03:37.190 --> 01:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
name Sue is it really likely that nobody
 
01:03:39.470 --> 01:03:39.480 align:start position:0%
else except the teacher knows that very
 
01:03:41.450 --> 01:03:41.460 align:start position:0%
unlikely some other students some of the
 
01:03:43.670 --> 01:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
people in the school know that and what
 
01:03:46.549 --> 01:03:46.559 align:start position:0%
happens if there really is a threat to
 
01:03:49.549 --> 01:03:49.559 align:start position:0%
the child if the parent finds out if the
 
01:03:52.250 --> 01:03:52.260 align:start position:0%
only thing the school does is not tell
 
01:03:53.990 --> 01:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
the parent what do you think is going to
 
01:03:55.490 --> 01:03:55.500 align:start position:0%
happen if somehow it gets back to the
 
01:03:57.710 --> 01:03:57.720 align:start position:0%
parent from another from another uh
 
01:04:00.410 --> 01:04:00.420 align:start position:0%
Source the school's going to say oh we
 
01:04:03.230 --> 01:04:03.240 align:start position:0%
we we satisfied our responsibility we
 
01:04:05.210 --> 01:04:05.220 align:start position:0%
just we didn't tell the parents so we're
 
01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
off the hook of course that shouldn't be
 
01:04:09.410 --> 01:04:09.420 align:start position:0%
the law and this doesn't allow it to be
 
01:04:12.829 --> 01:04:12.839 align:start position:0%
the law what it says is schools if you
 
01:04:15.770 --> 01:04:15.780 align:start position:0%
have a real basis to believe that
 
01:04:18.530 --> 01:04:18.540 align:start position:0%
there's a threat to a child then you yes
 
01:04:21.170 --> 01:04:21.180 align:start position:0%
of course you can take action and maybe
 
01:04:23.210 --> 01:04:23.220 align:start position:0%
part of that action is you don't tell
 
01:04:25.490 --> 01:04:25.500 align:start position:0%
the parents but you have to do more you
 
01:04:28.970 --> 01:04:28.980 align:start position:0%
have to actually take some action and if
 
01:04:31.250 --> 01:04:31.260 align:start position:0%
you're not willing to do that if all you
 
01:04:34.130 --> 01:04:34.140 align:start position:0%
want to do is just not tell the parents
 
01:04:37.849 --> 01:04:37.859 align:start position:0%
that strongly suggests that that you're
 
01:04:39.950 --> 01:04:39.960 align:start position:0%
not really concerned with the welfare of
 
01:04:41.390 --> 01:04:41.400 align:start position:0%
the child and you're just trying to
 
01:04:43.910 --> 01:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
avoid the child having to have a
 
01:04:46.490 --> 01:04:46.500 align:start position:0%
difficult conversation with a parent and
 
01:04:49.130 --> 01:04:49.140 align:start position:0%
I submit to you respectfully that should
 
01:04:53.750 --> 01:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:55.730 --> 01:04:55.740 align:start position:0%
the house will be in order the question
 
01:04:57.589 --> 01:04:57.599 align:start position:0%
before the house is the ought to pass
 
01:05:01.549 --> 01:05:01.559 align:start position:0%
motion on floor Amendment 1146 H are you
 
01:05:03.890 --> 01:05:03.900 align:start position:0%
ready for the question division was
 
01:05:05.450 --> 01:05:05.460 align:start position:0%
called this will be a division votes
 
01:05:34.910 --> 01:05:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:24.770 --> 01:06:24.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:27.109 --> 01:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
01:06:32.809 --> 01:06:32.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:34.490 --> 01:06:34.500 align:start position:0%
thank you chair
 
01:06:36.529 --> 01:06:36.539 align:start position:0%
if I know that the responsibility of
 
01:06:38.270 --> 01:06:38.280 align:start position:0%
lawmakers is to first and foremost
 
01:06:40.609 --> 01:06:40.619 align:start position:0%
prioritize the collective well-being of
 
01:06:42.950 --> 01:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
granite Staters in their decision making
 
01:06:44.750 --> 01:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
and if I know that our transgender and
 
01:06:46.250 --> 01:06:46.260 align:start position:0%
gender questioning youth have the same
 
01:06:48.289 --> 01:06:48.299 align:start position:0%
right to safety and privacy as any other
 
01:06:50.390 --> 01:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
student and if I know that this bill
 
01:06:52.670 --> 01:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
would mandate autocratic surveillance of
 
01:06:54.289 --> 01:06:54.299 align:start position:0%
students as well as the outing of
 
01:06:56.089 --> 01:06:56.099 align:start position:0%
transgender students regardless of the
 
01:06:58.309 --> 01:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
known or unknown family Dynamics
 
01:07:00.470 --> 01:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
and if I know that child abuse including
 
01:07:02.450 --> 01:07:02.460 align:start position:0%
the known incitement of psychological
 
01:07:04.789 --> 01:07:04.799 align:start position:0%
and emotional harm are serious offenses
 
01:07:06.829 --> 01:07:06.839 align:start position:0%
that produce an unnecessary threat to
 
01:07:09.170 --> 01:07:09.180 align:start position:0%
the well-being of our children then I
 
01:07:12.230 --> 01:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
would now compel you to vote no on the
 
01:07:15.470 --> 01:07:15.480 align:start position:0%
amendment before us thank you
 
01:07:17.569 --> 01:07:17.579 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative Lynn
 
01:07:23.089 --> 01:07:23.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:25.370 --> 01:07:25.380 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you madam speaker if I
 
01:07:27.529 --> 01:07:27.539 align:start position:0%
know that this bill represents a
 
01:07:29.870 --> 01:07:29.880 align:start position:0%
carefully balanced approach that is
 
01:07:31.910 --> 01:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
designed that draws an appropriate
 
01:07:35.589 --> 01:07:35.599 align:start position:0%
protection for children against abuse
 
01:07:39.170 --> 01:07:39.180 align:start position:0%
and also preserves parental rights and
 
01:07:41.569 --> 01:07:41.579 align:start position:0%
enhances parental rights and if I know
 
01:07:44.809 --> 01:07:44.819 align:start position:0%
that the that much of the opposition to
 
01:07:47.569 --> 01:07:47.579 align:start position:0%
this bill is based on the theory that
 
01:07:50.569 --> 01:07:50.579 align:start position:0%
parents can't be trusted that school
 
01:07:52.910 --> 01:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
officials know better or the government
 
01:07:56.510 --> 01:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
knows better than than parents what's in
 
01:07:58.970 --> 01:07:58.980 align:start position:0%
their best interest and that of why and
 
01:08:00.770 --> 01:08:00.780 align:start position:0%
if I know that while of course there
 
01:08:03.049 --> 01:08:03.059 align:start position:0%
needs to be safeguards to protect to
 
01:08:05.630 --> 01:08:05.640 align:start position:0%
protect children uh from from the very
 
01:08:08.569 --> 01:08:08.579 align:start position:0%
very few parents who may be abusive or
 
01:08:12.109 --> 01:08:12.119 align:start position:0%
neglectful uh this bill contains those
 
01:08:15.289 --> 01:08:15.299 align:start position:0%
protections then what I press the green

I stand in opposition to hb10
 
01:10:25.790 --> 01:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
for those of us that have walked in

these shoes we know how domestic
 
01:10:30.709 --> 01:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
violence can fester and thrive in the
 
01:10:33.290 --> 01:10:33.300 align:start position:0%
secrecy of our homes how even the
 
01:10:35.990 --> 01:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
smallest upset can lead to holes in the
 
01:10:39.050 --> 01:10:39.060 align:start position:0%
walls bruises and a tirade of verbal
 
01:10:39.060 --> 01:10:40.250 align:start position:0%
walls bruises and a tirade of verbal
insults

01:10:40.250 --> 01:10:40.260 align:start position:0%
insults
 
01:10:42.770 --> 01:10:42.780 align:start position:0%
for many of us we share this reality
 
01:10:44.330 --> 01:10:44.340 align:start position:0%
with children
 
01:10:46.010 --> 01:10:46.020 align:start position:0%
children that don't know any different
 
01:10:49.490 --> 01:10:49.500 align:start position:0%
this is the only life that they know
 
01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
as a matter of fact in 2020 according to
 
01:10:56.930 --> 01:10:56.940 align:start position:0%

as many as 10 million children in the

and caregivers in their home each year
 
01:11:17.030 --> 01:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
are all parents abusive absolutely not
 
01:11:20.390 --> 01:11:20.400 align:start position:0%

01:11:27.070 --> 01:11:27.080 align:start position:0%
we had a very brave Survivor testify
 
01:11:30.410 --> 01:11:30.420 align:start position:0%
here's a small portion of her testimony
 
01:11:32.810 --> 01:11:32.820 align:start position:0%
while some parents are good and
 
01:11:35.570 --> 01:11:35.580 align:start position:0%
trustworthy I know firsthand the damage
 
01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
a parent can inflict as a Survivor I
 
01:11:40.610 --> 01:11:40.620 align:start position:0%
know the importance of being able to
 
01:11:42.950 --> 01:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
have trusted teachers and faculty at
 
01:11:45.470 --> 01:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
schools teachers and counselors are
 
01:11:47.750 --> 01:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
required to go to school and get to
 
01:11:51.050 --> 01:11:51.060 align:start position:0%
Greece to teach and advise kids
 
01:11:53.810 --> 01:11:53.820 align:start position:0%
but anyone can be a parent no degree or
 
01:11:55.610 --> 01:11:55.620 align:start position:0%
class is required
 
01:11:58.810 --> 01:11:58.820 align:start position:0%
she is only 16 and she is my daughter
 
01:12:01.850 --> 01:12:01.860 align:start position:0%
her journey is one that I know but even
 
01:12:04.550 --> 01:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
for what I know part of it that I do not
 
01:12:08.209 --> 01:12:08.219 align:start position:0%
know is hers to tell when she's ready
 
01:12:10.189 --> 01:12:10.199 align:start position:0%
I was fortunate when our walls Came
 
01:12:12.890 --> 01:12:12.900 align:start position:0%
Crashing Down to have teachers that each
 
01:12:15.470 --> 01:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
of my children could talk to it was a
 
01:12:18.050 --> 01:12:18.060 align:start position:0%
brutal and scary moment in life the
 
01:12:20.030 --> 01:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
authorities even telling us that he was
 
01:12:21.950 --> 01:12:21.960 align:start position:0%
most likely going to come after me and
 
01:12:23.390 --> 01:12:23.400 align:start position:0%
kill me
 
01:12:25.610 --> 01:12:25.620 align:start position:0%
I had a lifetime protection order for
 
01:12:25.620 --> 01:12:26.689 align:start position:0%
I had a lifetime protection order for
myself

01:12:26.689 --> 01:12:26.699 align:start position:0%
myself
 
01:12:29.090 --> 01:12:29.100 align:start position:0%
but for the kids that was still a
 
01:12:30.770 --> 01:12:30.780 align:start position:0%
process of going through a parental
 
01:12:34.370 --> 01:12:34.380 align:start position:0%
rights evaluator waiting for findings
 
01:12:36.830 --> 01:12:36.840 align:start position:0%
as the kids started to realize that this
 
01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
wasn't how everyone lived they shared
 
01:12:41.450 --> 01:12:41.460 align:start position:0%
with their trusted teachers parts of
 
01:12:43.130 --> 01:12:43.140 align:start position:0%
what they had lived through
 
01:12:46.130 --> 01:12:46.140 align:start position:0%
was their biological father asking what
 
01:12:48.470 --> 01:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
was happening in school what was going
 
01:12:52.070 --> 01:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
on with the kids absolutely that was his
 
01:12:54.709 --> 01:12:54.719 align:start position:0%
right as a father
 
01:12:57.110 --> 01:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
I could only imagine his struggle with
 
01:12:58.729 --> 01:12:58.739 align:start position:0%
this since he had been in full control
 
01:13:01.729 --> 01:13:01.739 align:start position:0%
of Our Lives for over 16 years
 
01:13:03.709 --> 01:13:03.719 align:start position:0%
however as the authorities were
 
01:13:05.990 --> 01:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
investigating the teachers did not
 
01:13:08.810 --> 01:13:08.820 align:start position:0%
divulge details to him understanding the
 
01:13:11.570 --> 01:13:11.580 align:start position:0%
dangers involved if they did he had
 
01:13:14.090 --> 01:13:14.100 align:start position:0%
after all told each of the kids if they
 
01:13:16.430 --> 01:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
told anyone he would finish the job of
 
01:13:18.290 --> 01:13:18.300 align:start position:0%
strangling their brother
 
01:13:20.810 --> 01:13:20.820 align:start position:0%
if a bill like hb10 had been in place
 
01:13:22.850 --> 01:13:22.860 align:start position:0%
they would have been compelled to tell
 
01:13:22.860 --> 01:13:23.689 align:start position:0%
they would have been compelled to tell
him

01:13:23.689 --> 01:13:23.699 align:start position:0%
him
 
01:13:25.310 --> 01:13:25.320 align:start position:0%
you might be wondering about that
 
01:13:27.470 --> 01:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
protection order I had that should be
 
01:13:29.570 --> 01:13:29.580 align:start position:0%
keeping him far enough away from them to
 
01:13:31.130 --> 01:13:31.140 align:start position:0%
keep them safe since they were with me
 
01:13:32.510 --> 01:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
most of the time
 
01:13:37.130 --> 01:13:37.140 align:start position:0%
when I turned on my car multiple times
 
01:13:39.410 --> 01:13:39.420 align:start position:0%
the Bluetooth would say connecting to
 
01:13:41.870 --> 01:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
Joseph's iPhone he was within a hundred
 
01:13:43.370 --> 01:13:43.380 align:start position:0%
feet of us
 
01:13:47.050 --> 01:13:47.060 align:start position:0%
our story and my kids are not anomalies
 
01:13:50.270 --> 01:13:50.280 align:start position:0%
so many kids are suffering abuse and the
 
01:13:52.850 --> 01:13:52.860 align:start position:0%
only chance they have for respite and a
 
01:13:54.850 --> 01:13:54.860 align:start position:0%
sense of peace is when they go to school
 
01:13:58.430 --> 01:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
in that safe place hopefully they have a
 
01:13:59.630 --> 01:13:59.640 align:start position:0%
chance to tell a teacher what's
 
01:14:02.510 --> 01:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
happening at home and this part is so
 
01:14:05.810 --> 01:14:05.820 align:start position:0%
important even still many kiddos have
 
01:14:08.330 --> 01:14:08.340 align:start position:0%
practiced tells with something more
 
01:14:10.610 --> 01:14:10.620 align:start position:0%
benign before they divulge information
 
01:14:12.830 --> 01:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
that could be life or death for them
 
01:14:15.950 --> 01:14:15.960 align:start position:0%
just to see if they are safe to see if
 
01:14:18.590 --> 01:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
what they say gets back to their parents
 
01:14:21.649 --> 01:14:21.659 align:start position:0%
hb10 will absolutely take away their
 
01:14:23.890 --> 01:14:23.900 align:start position:0%
safe place and as the education
 
01:14:26.149 --> 01:14:26.159 align:start position:0%
commissioner put into place the one
 
01:14:28.070 --> 01:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
trusted adult program
 
01:14:30.410 --> 01:14:30.420 align:start position:0%
and if you're thinking that the
 
01:14:32.450 --> 01:14:32.460 align:start position:0%
following part of the bill
 
01:14:34.490 --> 01:14:34.500 align:start position:0%
makes this um
 
01:14:36.770 --> 01:14:36.780 align:start position:0%
covers this part for this reality from
 
01:14:39.470 --> 01:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
too many children because it says does
 
01:14:41.930 --> 01:14:41.940 align:start position:0%
not authorize a parent of a minor child
 
01:14:45.110 --> 01:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
to engage in conduct that is unlawful or
 
01:14:47.390 --> 01:14:47.400 align:start position:0%
to abuse or neglect his or her minor
 
01:14:50.390 --> 01:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
child in violation of the law I beg you
 
01:14:52.850 --> 01:14:52.860 align:start position:0%
to remember that this is already against
 
01:14:55.250 --> 01:14:55.260 align:start position:0%
the law and children are still being
 
01:14:58.370 --> 01:14:58.380 align:start position:0%
abused daily please vote against this
 
01:15:00.770 --> 01:15:00.780 align:start position:0%
dangerous and damaging bill as my
 
01:15:03.229 --> 01:15:03.239 align:start position:0%
daughter so eloquently said not all
 
01:15:06.229 --> 01:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
homes are like ours was but some are and
 
01:15:10.550 --> 01:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:12.290 --> 01:15:12.300 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:13.430 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
Terry

01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
Terry
 
01:15:19.209 --> 01:15:19.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:22.130 --> 01:15:22.140 align:start position:0%
representative Terry is waving off
 
01:15:23.810 --> 01:15:23.820 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
01:15:23.820 --> 01:15:30.110 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
petrigno

01:15:30.110 --> 01:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:31.970 --> 01:15:31.980 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:15:35.630 --> 01:15:35.640 align:start position:0%
excuse me Madam speaker my apologies
 
01:15:38.950 --> 01:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
I rise in opposition to house bill 10.
 
01:15:42.169 --> 01:15:42.179 align:start position:0%
recognizing fully that the deepest human
 
01:15:45.350 --> 01:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
bond is between parents and their
 
01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:46.550 align:start position:0%
bond is between parents and their
children

01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:15:49.370 --> 01:15:49.380 align:start position:0%
and that parents have an inalienable
 
01:15:51.350 --> 01:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
right to direct the upbringing of their
 
01:15:54.050 --> 01:15:54.060 align:start position:0%
children and that those rights are well
 
01:15:55.850 --> 01:15:55.860 align:start position:0%
rooted in common law
 
01:15:58.610 --> 01:15:58.620 align:start position:0%
yet there are questions and
 
01:16:01.130 --> 01:16:01.140 align:start position:0%
considerations which put this
 
01:16:03.890 --> 01:16:03.900 align:start position:0%
legislation in doubt
 
01:16:05.570 --> 01:16:05.580 align:start position:0%
it should be noted that the vast
 
01:16:07.850 --> 01:16:07.860 align:start position:0%
majority of Educators and school board
 
01:16:10.669 --> 01:16:10.679 align:start position:0%
members are parents too
 
01:16:13.430 --> 01:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
do we seriously believe that they would
 
01:16:16.010 --> 01:16:16.020 align:start position:0%
promote school policies that would deny
 
01:16:20.030 --> 01:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
them their rights as parents
 
01:16:21.770 --> 01:16:21.780 align:start position:0%
I wonder if some parents will feel
 
01:16:23.630 --> 01:16:23.640 align:start position:0%
emboldened to take on schools for
 
01:16:26.030 --> 01:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
anything they believe to be improper
 
01:16:28.070 --> 01:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
will this result in a barrage of
 
01:16:30.530 --> 01:16:30.540 align:start position:0%
frivolous lawsuits that school districts
 
01:16:32.990 --> 01:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
will have to defend at tax payers
 
01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:34.970 align:start position:0%
will have to defend at tax payers
expense

01:16:34.970 --> 01:16:34.980 align:start position:0%
expense
 
01:16:37.189 --> 01:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
but the greatest points here is that
 
01:16:40.610 --> 01:16:40.620 align:start position:0%
this legislation is not necessary
 
01:16:42.530 --> 01:16:42.540 align:start position:0%
simply because the rights enumerated
 
01:16:44.750 --> 01:16:44.760 align:start position:0%
already exist in federal and state
 
01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:45.890 align:start position:0%
already exist in federal and state
statutes

01:16:45.890 --> 01:16:45.900 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
the department of education's directives
 
01:16:50.689 --> 01:16:50.699 align:start position:0%
and School Board policies
 
01:16:53.270 --> 01:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
in fact at the beginning of this school
 
01:16:54.649 --> 01:16:54.659 align:start position:0%
year the Department of Education
 
01:16:56.390 --> 01:16:56.400 align:start position:0%
released the technical advisory to
 
01:16:58.850 --> 01:16:58.860 align:start position:0%
parents listening all of the rights
 
01:17:02.930 --> 01:17:02.940 align:start position:0%
which are now restated in this bill
 
01:17:06.110 --> 01:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
it's almost as if the sponsors cut and
 
01:17:08.030 --> 01:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
paste this bill together
 
01:17:09.590 --> 01:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
from the Department of education's
 
01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:12.110 align:start position:0%
from the Department of education's
website

01:17:12.110 --> 01:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:15.050 --> 01:17:15.060 align:start position:0%
more so in committee
 
01:17:17.570 --> 01:17:17.580 align:start position:0%
the sponsors themselves admitted that
 
01:17:20.090 --> 01:17:20.100 align:start position:0%
parental rights already exist
 
01:17:22.149 --> 01:17:22.159 align:start position:0%
and I quote
 
01:17:27.830 --> 01:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:29.930 --> 01:17:29.940 align:start position:0%
Beyond this point the focus in committee
 
01:17:31.610 --> 01:17:31.620 align:start position:0%
was on provisions
 
01:17:34.250 --> 01:17:34.260 align:start position:0%
which require teachers to respond to
 
01:17:38.450 --> 01:17:38.460 align:start position:0%
parents inquiries upon requests
 
01:17:41.330 --> 01:17:41.340 align:start position:0%
the sponsor is no full well that this is
 
01:17:43.970 --> 01:17:43.980 align:start position:0%
not a natural right
 
01:17:47.630 --> 01:17:47.640 align:start position:0%
and arguably unconstitutional
 
01:17:50.330 --> 01:17:50.340 align:start position:0%
it would be the equivalent of telling
 
01:17:50.340 --> 01:17:51.290 align:start position:0%
it would be the equivalent of telling
someone

01:17:51.290 --> 01:17:51.300 align:start position:0%
someone
 
01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
that their life is threatened if they do
 
01:17:57.770 --> 01:17:57.780 align:start position:0%
not tell you what they want to know
 
01:17:59.930 --> 01:17:59.940 align:start position:0%
that's not a right
 
01:18:02.030 --> 01:18:02.040 align:start position:0%
that's coercion
 
01:18:04.010 --> 01:18:04.020 align:start position:0%
in this case it would mean that teachers
 
01:18:06.110 --> 01:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
would lose their jobs and face civil in
 
01:18:08.510 --> 01:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
criminal liability
 
01:18:10.790 --> 01:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
this is not a matter of keeping secrets
 
01:18:14.149 --> 01:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
no responsible adult keeps inappropriate
 
01:18:15.950 --> 01:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
secrets with children
 
01:18:19.850 --> 01:18:19.860 align:start position:0%
this is a this is a matter of teachers
 
01:18:23.510 --> 01:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
not betraying students confidentiality
 
01:18:25.910 --> 01:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
as trusted adults
 
01:18:28.729 --> 01:18:28.739 align:start position:0%
I was a teacher for 40 years
 
01:18:31.130 --> 01:18:31.140 align:start position:0%
as a teacher ask me about your child's
 
01:18:32.810 --> 01:18:32.820 align:start position:0%
academic performance
 
01:18:35.570 --> 01:18:35.580 align:start position:0%
and their school conduct and I will be
 
01:18:37.550 --> 01:18:37.560 align:start position:0%
happy to answer
 
01:18:40.310 --> 01:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
ask me about concerns regarding your
 
01:18:42.770 --> 01:18:42.780 align:start position:0%
child's gender identity and I will tell
 
01:18:45.590 --> 01:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
you you need to go home and talk
 
01:18:47.810 --> 01:18:47.820 align:start position:0%
to your child
 
01:18:50.630 --> 01:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
as a trusted adult I will not violate
 
01:18:52.669 --> 01:18:52.679 align:start position:0%
students confidentiality
 
01:18:54.470 --> 01:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
and no one
 
01:18:57.770 --> 01:18:57.780 align:start position:0%
is going to force me to go against my
 
01:19:01.669 --> 01:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:04.490 --> 01:19:04.500 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that none of this
 
01:19:07.430 --> 01:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
was ever an issue until recently
 
01:19:09.830 --> 01:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
but now that students who identify as
 
01:19:12.290 --> 01:19:12.300 align:start position:0%
lgbtq Plus
 
01:19:14.990 --> 01:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
are no longer willing to remain in the
 
01:19:17.810 --> 01:19:17.820 align:start position:0%
closet it appears that some parents are
 
01:19:20.750 --> 01:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
now demanding to know
 
01:19:22.850 --> 01:19:22.860 align:start position:0%
are we trying to legislate to account
 
01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
for the lack of openness that some
 
01:19:27.770 --> 01:19:27.780 align:start position:0%
children have with their parents
 
01:19:30.169 --> 01:19:30.179 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason
 
01:19:32.390 --> 01:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
probably the most compelling testimonial
 
01:19:33.950 --> 01:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
committee came from the New Hampshire's
 
01:19:37.610 --> 01:19:37.620 align:start position:0%
child advocate who testified in our
 
01:19:40.910 --> 01:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
committee that there are children who
 
01:19:43.189 --> 01:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
are abused when they have disclosed
 
01:19:45.110 --> 01:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
their gender identity to their families
 
01:19:49.310 --> 01:19:49.320 align:start position:0%
and that her office sees such cases on a
 
01:19:52.130 --> 01:19:52.140 align:start position:0%
daily basis
 
01:19:54.290 --> 01:19:54.300 align:start position:0%
threatening action against trusted
 
01:19:58.189 --> 01:19:58.199 align:start position:0%
adults put all vulnerable children not
 
01:20:00.830 --> 01:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
just those of the LGBT community In
 
01:20:03.470 --> 01:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
it was only this past summer
 
01:20:07.729 --> 01:20:07.739 align:start position:0%
that the governor created a unique
 
01:20:09.290 --> 01:20:09.300 align:start position:0%
partnership between the Department of
 
01:20:11.750 --> 01:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
Education and the one trusted adult
 
01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:13.250 align:start position:0%
Education and the one trusted adult
program

01:20:13.250 --> 01:20:13.260 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:20:15.950 --> 01:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
in doing so the one trusted adult
 
01:20:18.050 --> 01:20:18.060 align:start position:0%
founder said
 
01:20:20.990 --> 01:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
when a student can name a trusted adult
 
01:20:24.410 --> 01:20:24.420 align:start position:0%
at school we create our best chance for
 
01:20:26.450 --> 01:20:26.460 align:start position:0%
preventing bullying
 
01:20:29.649 --> 01:20:29.659 align:start position:0%
mental health issues and substance abuse
 
01:20:32.990 --> 01:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
all while promoting positive self-worth
 
01:20:35.810 --> 01:20:35.820 align:start position:0%
engagement in community and availability
 
01:20:38.510 --> 01:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
for learning
 
01:20:40.490 --> 01:20:40.500 align:start position:0%
pass this law
 
01:20:43.189 --> 01:20:43.199 align:start position:0%
and you are putting every child who
 
01:20:45.229 --> 01:20:45.239 align:start position:0%
struggles with something at risk
 
01:20:47.390 --> 01:20:47.400 align:start position:0%
pass this and you are telling the
 
01:20:50.330 --> 01:20:50.340 align:start position:0%
governor to say goodbye to his one
 
01:20:53.149 --> 01:20:53.159 align:start position:0%
trusted adult program
 
01:20:55.970 --> 01:20:55.980 align:start position:0%
yes we can all agree that parents have
 
01:20:57.530 --> 01:20:57.540 align:start position:0%
the right to direct the education of
 
01:20:59.270 --> 01:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
their children but never to the
 
01:21:02.149 --> 01:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
detriment of the rights of other parents
 
01:21:04.790 --> 01:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
or which compromise the safety of all
 
01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:06.110 align:start position:0%
or which compromise the safety of all
children

01:21:06.110 --> 01:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:21:08.990 --> 01:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
more than codifying a negligible list of
 
01:21:10.790 --> 01:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
parental rights the real Focus to
 
01:21:12.770 --> 01:21:12.780 align:start position:0%
promote the well-being of children
 
01:21:15.950 --> 01:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
must be on Parental Partnerships with
 
01:21:19.189 --> 01:21:19.199 align:start position:0%
schools to promote values in Civic
 
01:21:23.390 --> 01:21:23.400 align:start position:0%
virtues in our diverse Society
 
01:21:25.430 --> 01:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
and to foster a learning environment
 
01:21:27.890 --> 01:21:27.900 align:start position:0%
where all of our students can Thrive
 
01:21:31.970 --> 01:21:31.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:33.649 --> 01:21:33.659 align:start position:0%
house will be in order
 
01:21:35.510 --> 01:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes rep resentative Steven
 
01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:46.130 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes rep resentative Steven
Smith

01:21:46.130 --> 01:21:46.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:48.050 --> 01:21:48.060 align:start position:0%
thank you madam speaker
 
01:21:50.510 --> 01:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
I rise today in support of New Hampshire
 
01:21:54.470 --> 01:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
parents families and the children
 
01:21:56.570 --> 01:21:56.580 align:start position:0%
families are ugly right the messy they
 
01:21:58.790 --> 01:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
can be I mean mine wasn't Norman
 
01:22:01.669 --> 01:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
Rockwell for sure both with my parents
 
01:22:05.209 --> 01:22:05.219 align:start position:0%
and then as a parent with my kids
 
01:22:08.209 --> 01:22:08.219 align:start position:0%
but you get through it it can be
 
01:22:09.830 --> 01:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
ugly hurtful
 
01:22:12.530 --> 01:22:12.540 align:start position:0%
and always worth it because your family
 
01:22:15.110 --> 01:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
right they're the people that will be
 
01:22:17.390 --> 01:22:17.400 align:start position:0%
there for you to back you up even if
 
01:22:20.090 --> 01:22:20.100 align:start position:0%
they don't like you
 
01:22:22.310 --> 01:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
which was a good thing in my family so
 
01:22:25.850 --> 01:22:25.860 align:start position:0%
in one example of my parental failings
 
01:22:28.990 --> 01:22:29.000 align:start position:0%
uh one of my sons we did not get along
 
01:22:32.689 --> 01:22:32.699 align:start position:0%
there had been a long history of my
 
01:22:34.970 --> 01:22:34.980 align:start position:0%
ex-wife and I not making things go
 
01:22:36.910 --> 01:22:36.920 align:start position:0%
particularly well in the households
 
01:22:39.950 --> 01:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
using tools against each other and this
 
01:22:42.110 --> 01:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
particular child while he was a rebel
 
01:22:44.510 --> 01:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
and strong
 
01:22:47.209 --> 01:22:47.219 align:start position:0%
headed and willful no idea where he got
 
01:22:50.510 --> 01:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
that could not possibly be genetic
 
01:22:52.910 --> 01:22:52.920 align:start position:0%
we did probably everything we could to
 
01:22:54.830 --> 01:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
go at each other for a while and then he
 
01:22:58.250 --> 01:22:58.260 align:start position:0%
became an adult and we didn't speak for
 
01:22:58.260 --> 01:22:59.209 align:start position:0%
became an adult and we didn't speak for
years

01:22:59.209 --> 01:22:59.219 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:23:02.090 --> 01:23:02.100 align:start position:0%
until one day he found himself in a
 
01:23:04.189 --> 01:23:04.199 align:start position:0%
particularly difficult situation in his
 
01:23:08.630 --> 01:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:11.030 --> 01:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
no matter what we did to each other he
 
01:23:13.850 --> 01:23:13.860 align:start position:0%
knew that in his darkest moment I would
 
01:23:16.070 --> 01:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
be the one that would back him up
 
01:23:18.350 --> 01:23:18.360 align:start position:0%
give parents a little credit we we
 
01:23:21.290 --> 01:23:21.300 align:start position:0%
explode on things but we still love our
 
01:23:24.169 --> 01:23:24.179 align:start position:0%
kids we may not even like our kids
 
01:23:26.510 --> 01:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
but we still love our kids and will do
 
01:23:29.030 --> 01:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
anything for them
 
01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:30.590 align:start position:0%
anything for them
so

01:23:30.590 --> 01:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:23:33.649 --> 01:23:33.659 align:start position:0%
do you think it's harder for the kid
 
01:23:36.169 --> 01:23:36.179 align:start position:0%
that's in a difficult situation to just
 
01:23:38.030 --> 01:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
deal with what they're going through or
 
01:23:39.709 --> 01:23:39.719 align:start position:0%
to think they have to hide it from their
 
01:23:41.870 --> 01:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
parents and my household that meant
 
01:23:43.490 --> 01:23:43.500 align:start position:0%
there were going to be two difficult
 
01:23:46.189 --> 01:23:46.199 align:start position:0%
conversations the one where I'm asking
 
01:23:48.350 --> 01:23:48.360 align:start position:0%
why did I have to find this out from
 
01:23:50.209 --> 01:23:50.219 align:start position:0%
somebody else and then you get to the
 
01:23:52.189 --> 01:23:52.199 align:start position:0%
important one and you know that first
 
01:23:54.050 --> 01:23:54.060 align:start position:0%
one it's it's a waste of time but it's
 
01:23:56.570 --> 01:23:56.580 align:start position:0%
going to happen why did your child not
 
01:23:58.490 --> 01:23:58.500 align:start position:0%
confide in you
 
01:24:00.590 --> 01:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
when whenever that happens and it was
 
01:24:02.810 --> 01:24:02.820 align:start position:0%
rare I would try to figure out what I
 
01:24:04.490 --> 01:24:04.500 align:start position:0%
had done to make them feel like they
 
01:24:06.830 --> 01:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
couldn't confide in me we should be
 
01:24:09.169 --> 01:24:09.179 align:start position:0%
encouraging those conversations not
 
01:24:11.450 --> 01:24:11.460 align:start position:0%
discouraging them by telling the kids
 
01:24:12.590 --> 01:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
you know we're not going to tell your
 
01:24:14.149 --> 01:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
parents about this that's that's not
 
01:24:14.159 --> 01:24:15.830 align:start position:0%
parents about this that's that's not
helpful

01:24:15.830 --> 01:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
01:24:19.450 --> 01:24:19.460 align:start position:0%
and these days of rising depression
 
01:24:22.189 --> 01:24:22.199 align:start position:0%
feelings of suicide among young people
 
01:24:25.310 --> 01:24:25.320 align:start position:0%
let me ask you do you think it helps or
 
01:24:27.950 --> 01:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
hurts to tell them that they shouldn't
 
01:24:29.510 --> 01:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
go home and talk to their parents about
 
01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:30.950 align:start position:0%
go home and talk to their parents about
this

01:24:30.950 --> 01:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:24:33.830 --> 01:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
do you think it helps or hurts that they
 
01:24:35.390 --> 01:24:35.400 align:start position:0%
are made to feel like they have to keep
 
01:24:37.250 --> 01:24:37.260 align:start position:0%
this thing a secret do you think that
 
01:24:39.350 --> 01:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
makes them less depressed or more
 
01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:40.970 align:start position:0%
makes them less depressed or more
depressed

01:24:40.970 --> 01:24:40.980 align:start position:0%
depressed
 
01:24:43.250 --> 01:24:43.260 align:start position:0%
I think it's more depressed but I'm not
 
01:24:45.050 --> 01:24:45.060 align:start position:0%
a psychologist I ask you to find that
 
01:24:48.169 --> 01:24:48.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:50.689 --> 01:24:50.699 align:start position:0%
when parents lose their rights right now
 
01:24:52.850 --> 01:24:52.860 align:start position:0%
for whatever transgression they've done
 
01:24:55.310 --> 01:24:55.320 align:start position:0%
there was a long strenuous process to go
 
01:24:57.410 --> 01:24:57.420 align:start position:0%
through to make that happen
 
01:25:00.110 --> 01:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
and that's right because taking
 
01:25:01.850 --> 01:25:01.860 align:start position:0%
someone's parental rights away should be
 
01:25:04.010 --> 01:25:04.020 align:start position:0%
a really big deal shouldn't it
 
01:25:04.020 --> 01:25:05.930 align:start position:0%
a really big deal shouldn't it
yeah

01:25:05.930 --> 01:25:05.940 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:25:10.010 --> 01:25:10.020 align:start position:0%
if I was a school employee do you think
 
01:25:13.430 --> 01:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
that I should decide what you know about
 
01:25:15.950 --> 01:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
your kids or do you think you should
 
01:25:17.209 --> 01:25:17.219 align:start position:0%
know that
 
01:25:18.890 --> 01:25:18.900 align:start position:0%
that's really the Crux of the matter
 
01:25:20.990 --> 01:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
here I think parents have a right to
 
01:25:22.850 --> 01:25:22.860 align:start position:0%
know everything about their kids they're
 
01:25:24.470 --> 01:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
their kids they're ultimately
 
01:25:26.630 --> 01:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
responsible for them for their emotional
 
01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:28.490 align:start position:0%
responsible for them for their emotional
development

01:25:28.490 --> 01:25:28.500 align:start position:0%
development
 
01:25:30.770 --> 01:25:30.780 align:start position:0%
for their financial responsibilities we
 
01:25:33.830 --> 01:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
are responsible for our children I do
 
01:25:35.870 --> 01:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
not want somebody sitting in an office
 
01:25:38.450 --> 01:25:38.460 align:start position:0%
somewhere or even a classroom to decide
 
01:25:41.209 --> 01:25:41.219 align:start position:0%
all by themselves you know what Steve
 
01:25:44.090 --> 01:25:44.100 align:start position:0%
doesn't get to know this about his kids
 
01:25:46.550 --> 01:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
that's wrong
 
01:25:48.890 --> 01:25:48.900 align:start position:0%
on a bigger level I'm not sure that it's
 
01:25:51.050 --> 01:25:51.060 align:start position:0%
a school's place to be involved in that
 
01:25:52.970 --> 01:25:52.980 align:start position:0%
type of development but if they are
 
01:25:54.709 --> 01:25:54.719 align:start position:0%
because that horse seems to have left
 
01:25:57.950 --> 01:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
the barn then let them be all in let
 
01:26:00.770 --> 01:26:00.780 align:start position:0%
them go all the way let them talk to the
 
01:26:02.689 --> 01:26:02.699 align:start position:0%
kids and say that's going to be really
 
01:26:04.370 --> 01:26:04.380 align:start position:0%
hard but you got to talk to your family
 
01:26:06.169 --> 01:26:06.179 align:start position:0%
about this and support those
 
01:26:08.330 --> 01:26:08.340 align:start position:0%
conversations and even facilitate those
 
01:26:11.209 --> 01:26:11.219 align:start position:0%
conversations not keep them a secret to
 
01:26:12.770 --> 01:26:12.780 align:start position:0%
connect the children with the resources
 
01:26:14.930 --> 01:26:14.940 align:start position:0%
that exist to support them as they go
 
01:26:17.270 --> 01:26:17.280 align:start position:0%
through what could be a difficult time
 
01:26:19.910 --> 01:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
and even the kids that will be surprised
 
01:26:21.649 --> 01:26:21.659 align:start position:0%
when they go home and find out the
 
01:26:23.330 --> 01:26:23.340 align:start position:0%
conversation wasn't as bad as they
 
01:26:25.550 --> 01:26:25.560 align:start position:0%
thought because at the end of the day
 
01:26:28.430 --> 01:26:28.440 align:start position:0%

01:28:55.189 --> 01:28:55.199 align:start position:0%
if I want to attack the inherent rights
 
01:28:56.390 --> 01:28:56.400 align:start position:0%

01:29:09.530 --> 01:29:09.540 align:start position:0%
not the government direct the upbringing
 
01:29:11.930 --> 01:29:11.940 align:start position:0%

01:29:22.850 --> 01:29:22.860 align:start position:0%
when asked about keeping secrets 78
 
01:29:25.430 --> 01:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
percent or better supported a parent's
 
01:29:27.350 --> 01:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
right to know
 
01:29:29.870 --> 01:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
if I also know that parents should be
 
01:29:32.270 --> 01:29:32.280 align:start position:0%
able to ask School personnel
 
01:29:34.250 --> 01:29:34.260 align:start position:0%
direct questions about their own
 
01:29:34.260 --> 01:29:35.270 align:start position:0%

children
 
01:29:37.790 --> 01:29:37.800 align:start position:0%
and what is happening to them in school
 
01:29:40.550 --> 01:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
because they pay taxes for full
 
01:29:43.850 --> 01:29:43.860 align:start position:0%
transparency not secrets
 
01:29:45.950 --> 01:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
and finally if I know that our
 
01:29:48.530 --> 01:29:48.540 align:start position:0%
children's future is on the line in that
 
01:29:50.930 --> 01:29:50.940 align:start position:0%
I along with many others believe that
 
01:29:53.330 --> 01:29:53.340 align:start position:0%
parents make the best choices for their
 
01:29:56.050 --> 01:29:56.060 align:start position:0%

01:33:54.970 --> 01:33:54.980 align:start position:0%
cause that is

01:34:09.830 --> 01:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
will put many kids who cannot do that in
 
01:34:09.840 --> 01:34:11.330 align:start position:0%

01:36:43.250 --> 01:36:43.260 align:start position:0%
well we'll definitely have her back up

01:36:58.669 --> 01:36:58.679 align:start position:0%
the same report the same with the

following resolution resolve that as
 
01:37:02.750 --> 01:37:02.760 align:start position:0%

01:37:08.270 --> 01:37:08.280 align:start position:0%
minority of the committee having

considered the same being unable to
 
01:37:11.330 --> 01:37:11.340 align:start position:0%
agree with the majority report the
 
01:37:12.709 --> 01:37:12.719 align:start position:0%

care recognizes
 
01:37:30.290 --> 01:37:30.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:32.930 --> 01:37:32.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:37:35.270 --> 01:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
I rise today to urge the distinguished
 
01:37:39.290 --> 01:37:39.300 align:start position:0%
body to oppose the itl motion on HB 548
 
01:37:41.330 --> 01:37:41.340 align:start position:0%
so that an amendment may be offered and
 
01:37:43.790 --> 01:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
another motion may be made
 
01:37:46.250 --> 01:37:46.260 align:start position:0%
this bill currently only has one flaw
 
01:37:48.410 --> 01:37:48.420 align:start position:0%
that of a crossout in the beginning that
 
01:37:50.810 --> 01:37:50.820 align:start position:0%
was never requested during Drafting and
 
01:37:52.310 --> 01:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
went unnoticed until the bill was in
 
01:37:52.320 --> 01:37:53.570 align:start position:0%
went unnoticed until the bill was in
committee

01:37:53.570 --> 01:37:53.580 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:37:55.430 --> 01:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
it's a very simple bill
 
01:37:57.649 --> 01:37:57.659 align:start position:0%
and a much needed bill
 
01:37:59.810 --> 01:37:59.820 align:start position:0%
this bill will set into law a definition
 
01:38:02.930 --> 01:38:02.940 align:start position:0%
of a threshold of what it means to be in
 
01:38:05.149 --> 01:38:05.159 align:start position:0%
compliance with child support
 
01:38:07.669 --> 01:38:07.679 align:start position:0%
currently under the RSA
 
01:38:09.290 --> 01:38:09.300 align:start position:0%
the Division of Child Support Services
 
01:38:12.110 --> 01:38:12.120 align:start position:0%
must report any arrearage resulting in
 
01:38:12.120 --> 01:38:13.729 align:start position:0%
must report any arrearage resulting in
non-compliance

01:38:13.729 --> 01:38:13.739 align:start position:0%
non-compliance
 
01:38:16.669 --> 01:38:16.679 align:start position:0%
of an order of Child Support to the
 
01:38:18.470 --> 01:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
01:38:21.110 --> 01:38:21.120 align:start position:0%
but the RSA does not define any dollar
 
01:38:23.629 --> 01:38:23.639 align:start position:0%
amount which if exceeded signifies
 
01:38:23.639 --> 01:38:25.490 align:start position:0%
amount which if exceeded signifies
non-compliance

01:38:25.490 --> 01:38:25.500 align:start position:0%
non-compliance
 
01:38:28.550 --> 01:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
thus a simple rounding error
 
01:38:30.470 --> 01:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
that put a person under the request
 
01:38:32.570 --> 01:38:32.580 align:start position:0%
required payment on any particular week
 
01:38:35.090 --> 01:38:35.100 align:start position:0%
by as little as one penny
 
01:38:36.709 --> 01:38:36.719 align:start position:0%
result in reporting to the federal
 
01:38:39.169 --> 01:38:39.179 align:start position:0%
government and denial of any federal
 
01:38:41.570 --> 01:38:41.580 align:start position:0%
government services
 
01:38:44.750 --> 01:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
I experienced this firsthand even though
 
01:38:46.490 --> 01:38:46.500 align:start position:0%
I pay child support by automatic
 
01:38:50.950 --> 01:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:50.960 --> 01:38:52.790 align:start position:0%
 
theoretically

01:38:52.790 --> 01:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
theoretically
 
01:38:55.129 --> 01:38:55.139 align:start position:0%
I should never be able to be in default
 
01:38:56.990 --> 01:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
because I have no control over the
 
01:38:58.550 --> 01:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
withdrawal of payments to the state from
 
01:39:01.729 --> 01:39:01.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:04.490 --> 01:39:04.500 align:start position:0%
imagine my surprise when I tried to
 
01:39:07.370 --> 01:39:07.380 align:start position:0%
renew my passport in 2022 so that I
 
01:39:09.350 --> 01:39:09.360 align:start position:0%
could go to Canada for work
 
01:39:10.970 --> 01:39:10.980 align:start position:0%
and I was denied because the federal
 
01:39:12.890 --> 01:39:12.900 align:start position:0%
government said I was not current on my
 
01:39:15.290 --> 01:39:15.300 align:start position:0%
child support payments
 
01:39:17.990 --> 01:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
how could this happen
 
01:39:19.970 --> 01:39:19.980 align:start position:0%
like most people these days I am not
 
01:39:22.850 --> 01:39:22.860 align:start position:0%
paid weekly I am paid bi-weekly
 
01:39:24.890 --> 01:39:24.900 align:start position:0%
the calculation for payments to the
 
01:39:26.689 --> 01:39:26.699 align:start position:0%
state is made by taking the court
 
01:39:28.669 --> 01:39:28.679 align:start position:0%
ordered weekly amount and multiplying it
 
01:39:32.990 --> 01:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
by 52. then dividing it by 26. this
 
01:39:34.550 --> 01:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
results in situations where I am
 
01:39:36.890 --> 01:39:36.900 align:start position:0%
sometimes over the amount due and
 
01:39:39.830 --> 01:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes under the amount due
 
01:39:41.629 --> 01:39:41.639 align:start position:0%
when the federal state department
 
01:39:45.169 --> 01:39:45.179 align:start position:0%
queried the state to process my passport
 
01:39:47.870 --> 01:39:47.880 align:start position:0%
they were told I was in arrears
 
01:39:50.750 --> 01:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
because the state system doesn't tell
 
01:39:52.910 --> 01:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
the federal government how much your
 
01:39:54.169 --> 01:39:54.179 align:start position:0%
inner ears
 
01:39:56.209 --> 01:39:56.219 align:start position:0%
I was told this directly from the state
 
01:39:58.250 --> 01:39:58.260 align:start position:0%
department when I called
 
01:40:00.229 --> 01:40:00.239 align:start position:0%
our system here in the state simply
 
01:40:04.129 --> 01:40:04.139 align:start position:0%
tells them thumbs up or thumbs down
 
01:40:10.490 --> 01:40:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:12.169 --> 01:40:12.179 align:start position:0%
could be a few months or it could be a
 
01:40:13.490 --> 01:40:13.500 align:start position:0%
penny the federal government's not going
 
01:40:15.050 --> 01:40:15.060 align:start position:0%
to know
 
01:40:16.729 --> 01:40:16.739 align:start position:0%
so this bill
 
01:40:19.070 --> 01:40:19.080 align:start position:0%
will ensure that only a true delinquency
 
01:40:21.290 --> 01:40:21.300 align:start position:0%
will qualify
 
01:40:23.390 --> 01:40:23.400 align:start position:0%
and simple rounding errors are not
 
01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:25.189 align:start position:0%
and simple rounding errors are not
reported

01:40:25.189 --> 01:40:25.199 align:start position:0%
reported
 
01:40:27.709 --> 01:40:27.719 align:start position:0%
it sets a threshold of twenty five
 
01:40:27.719 --> 01:40:30.530 align:start position:0%
it sets a threshold of twenty five
dollars

01:40:30.530 --> 01:40:30.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:32.870 --> 01:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
anything under 25 dollars the federal
 
01:40:34.550 --> 01:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
government doesn't need to be notified
 
01:40:36.290 --> 01:40:36.300 align:start position:0%
but anything that's over that we can
 
01:40:37.970 --> 01:40:37.980 align:start position:0%
start to consider that a delinquency in
 
01:40:39.169 --> 01:40:39.179 align:start position:0%
child support
 
01:40:41.030 --> 01:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
and report it and
 
01:40:43.610 --> 01:40:43.620 align:start position:0%
use those leverages that the federal
 
01:40:46.250 --> 01:40:46.260 align:start position:0%
government can do
 
01:40:48.110 --> 01:40:48.120 align:start position:0%
please join me in pressing the red
 
01:40:50.570 --> 01:40:50.580 align:start position:0%
button to overturn the itl
 
01:40:52.370 --> 01:40:52.380 align:start position:0%
so that a better motion can be made and
 
01:40:54.169 --> 01:40:54.179 align:start position:0%
so that the amendment can be given with
 
01:40:58.250 --> 01:40:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:59.870 --> 01:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
all it does is restore the crossed
 
01:41:01.970 --> 01:41:01.980 align:start position:0%
outline when we pass that Amendment
 
01:41:04.189 --> 01:41:04.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:41:11.990 --> 01:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:13.610 --> 01:41:13.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:41:15.770 --> 01:41:15.780 align:start position:0%
I rise in support of the committee
 
01:41:19.970 --> 01:41:19.980 align:start position:0%
recommendation of itl on HB 548
 
01:41:21.709 --> 01:41:21.719 align:start position:0%
this is a bill that was written in
 
01:41:24.350 --> 01:41:24.360 align:start position:0%
response to one individual's perception
 
01:41:26.810 --> 01:41:26.820 align:start position:0%
of why their application for passport
 
01:41:28.550 --> 01:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
renewal was denied by the federal
 
01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:29.870 align:start position:0%
renewal was denied by the federal
government

01:41:29.870 --> 01:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:41:31.550 --> 01:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
the committee was told that the password
 
01:41:33.890 --> 01:41:33.900 align:start position:0%
application was denied due to a rounding
 
01:41:35.990 --> 01:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
error that made them one cent behind on
 
01:41:38.750 --> 01:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
child support payments currently federal
 
01:41:41.990 --> 01:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
laws state that one must be 60 days in
 
01:41:44.149 --> 01:41:44.159 align:start position:0%
arrears and owe at least five hundred
 
01:41:47.149 --> 01:41:47.159 align:start position:0%
and fifty dollars before passport and or
 
01:41:50.090 --> 01:41:50.100 align:start position:0%
driver's license renewals can be frozen
 
01:41:52.430 --> 01:41:52.440 align:start position:0%
we do not know the private details of
 
01:41:54.830 --> 01:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
the anecdotal circumstance that led to
 
01:41:57.770 --> 01:41:57.780 align:start position:0%
the drafting of this bill however we do
 
01:42:00.709 --> 01:42:00.719 align:start position:0%
know that rounding errors and matters of
 
01:42:03.470 --> 01:42:03.480 align:start position:0%
pennies do not meet the threshold for
 
01:42:06.410 --> 01:42:06.420 align:start position:0%
impacting passports and driver's license
 
01:42:09.169 --> 01:42:09.179 align:start position:0%
this legislation is simply not needed
 
01:42:11.689 --> 01:42:11.699 align:start position:0%
and is essentially a solution in search
 
01:42:14.990 --> 01:42:15.000 align:start position:0%
of a problem this bill will impact the
 
01:42:16.970 --> 01:42:16.980 align:start position:0%
office of Child Support Services by
 
01:42:19.189 --> 01:42:19.199 align:start position:0%
creating an unfunded mandate to change
 
01:42:21.550 --> 01:42:21.560 align:start position:0%
how they track and when they report
 
01:42:24.350 --> 01:42:24.360 align:start position:0%
unpaid child support to the agency's
 
01:42:26.750 --> 01:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
responsibles for passports and driver's
 
01:42:29.570 --> 01:42:29.580 align:start position:0%
licenses I urge you to support the
 
01:42:31.970 --> 01:42:31.980 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:44:48.790 --> 01:44:48.800 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that our colleague
 
01:44:52.510 --> 01:44:52.520 align:start position:0%
and many others support paying people
 
01:44:55.850 --> 01:44:55.860 align:start position:0%
who pay their child support via
 
01:44:58.370 --> 01:44:58.380 align:start position:0%
garnished wages
 
01:45:01.430 --> 01:45:01.440 align:start position:0%

know that an agreement between two
 
01:45:51.109 --> 01:45:51.119 align:start position:0%

01:45:53.330 --> 01:45:53.340 align:start position:0%

01:49:19.129 --> 01:49:19.139 align:start position:0%
y through 61. we have a debate on the
 
01:49:20.689 --> 01:49:20.699 align:start position:0%
amendment the chair recognizes
 
01:49:24.790 --> 01:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:27.709 --> 01:49:27.719 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker the amendment
 
01:49:30.050 --> 01:49:30.060 align:start position:0%
before you which would is an amendment
 
01:49:32.209 --> 01:49:32.219 align:start position:0%
to a bill which would ban no knock
 
01:49:34.189 --> 01:49:34.199 align:start position:0%
warrants from being carried out in our
 
01:49:36.410 --> 01:49:36.420 align:start position:0%
state it is a simple Amendment which
 
01:49:38.930 --> 01:49:38.940 align:start position:0%
says in so many words that the practice
 
01:49:41.090 --> 01:49:41.100 align:start position:0%
of no knock warrants will be left to the
 
01:49:42.890 --> 01:49:42.900 align:start position:0%
discretion of the police department
 
01:49:45.229 --> 01:49:45.239 align:start position:0%
carrying out the warrant this would
 
01:49:48.109 --> 01:49:48.119 align:start position:0%
affirm the common law as it stands right
 
01:49:49.850 --> 01:49:49.860 align:start position:0%
now into statute
 
01:49:52.550 --> 01:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
my opposition to doing so is that it
 
01:49:56.270 --> 01:49:56.280 align:start position:0%
leaves this bill a hollow signal of
 
01:49:56.280 --> 01:49:57.410 align:start position:0%
leaves this bill a hollow signal of
virtue

01:49:57.410 --> 01:49:57.420 align:start position:0%
virtue
 
01:50:00.290 --> 01:50:00.300 align:start position:0%
I can recall with more clarity than I
 
01:50:02.930 --> 01:50:02.940 align:start position:0%
care for when the police barged into my
 
01:50:05.870 --> 01:50:05.880 align:start position:0%
house when I was butt six seven years
 
01:50:05.880 --> 01:50:06.649 align:start position:0%
house when I was butt six seven years
old

01:50:06.649 --> 01:50:06.659 align:start position:0%
old
 
01:50:09.350 --> 01:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
a shuddering scream from my mother woke
 
01:50:12.649 --> 01:50:12.659 align:start position:0%
me from what was a peaceful sleep
 
01:50:16.070 --> 01:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
I ran downstairs to find
 
01:50:16.080 --> 01:50:17.570 align:start position:0%
I ran downstairs to find
my mother

01:50:17.570 --> 01:50:17.580 align:start position:0%
my mother
 
01:50:19.729 --> 01:50:19.739 align:start position:0%
being yelled at by police officers
 
01:50:21.890 --> 01:50:21.900 align:start position:0%
demanding that that she could be
 
01:50:21.900 --> 01:50:23.750 align:start position:0%
demanding that that she could be
arrested

01:50:23.750 --> 01:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
arrested
 
01:50:25.729 --> 01:50:25.739 align:start position:0%
yelling at her friend shoving me to the
 
01:50:27.709 --> 01:50:27.719 align:start position:0%
side and taking out taking her out of
 
01:50:31.490 --> 01:50:31.500 align:start position:0%
the house no answers no conversation I
 
01:50:33.530 --> 01:50:33.540 align:start position:0%
sat there left with an old friend of
 
01:50:35.330 --> 01:50:35.340 align:start position:0%
hers who was staying the night both of
 
01:50:38.270 --> 01:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
us in absolute shock
 
01:50:41.209 --> 01:50:41.219 align:start position:0%
this prompted by someone calling the
 
01:50:43.129 --> 01:50:43.139 align:start position:0%
police on that friend who had committed
 
01:50:46.010 --> 01:50:46.020 align:start position:0%
the unforgivable crime of smoking a
 
01:50:48.649 --> 01:50:48.659 align:start position:0%
cigarette outside of his door not
 
01:50:50.270 --> 01:50:50.280 align:start position:0%
knowing that there was a rule in the
 
01:50:51.830 --> 01:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
apartment complex that you had to walk
 
01:50:53.750 --> 01:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
down to the street to smoke your
 
01:50:53.760 --> 01:50:56.390 align:start position:0%
down to the street to smoke your
cigarette

01:50:56.390 --> 01:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:59.209 --> 01:50:59.219 align:start position:0%
threatened her life with prison
 
01:51:01.729 --> 01:51:01.739 align:start position:0%
taking her children away from her luck
 
01:51:04.189 --> 01:51:04.199 align:start position:0%
was not on her side that day
 
01:51:07.790 --> 01:51:07.800 align:start position:0%
this was prompted because my mother who
 
01:51:10.550 --> 01:51:10.560 align:start position:0%
was pulled over a few weeks before just
 
01:51:12.410 --> 01:51:12.420 align:start position:0%
for the first time in her life may I add
 
01:51:15.590 --> 01:51:15.600 align:start position:0%
just so happened to have drugs on her
 
01:51:18.229 --> 01:51:18.239 align:start position:0%
the police arrested her tried to charge
 
01:51:20.090 --> 01:51:20.100 align:start position:0%
her with possession took her to court
 
01:51:21.830 --> 01:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
like I said threatened to take away her
 
01:51:24.590 --> 01:51:24.600 align:start position:0%
child and by the grace of God
 
01:51:26.450 --> 01:51:26.460 align:start position:0%
we stayed with her for our entire
 
01:51:29.090 --> 01:51:29.100 align:start position:0%
childhood and those charges were dropped
 
01:51:33.129 --> 01:51:33.139 align:start position:0%
but I recall this story not to interject
 
01:51:36.649 --> 01:51:36.659 align:start position:0%
my personal tale into this debate but to
 
01:51:38.570 --> 01:51:38.580 align:start position:0%
illustrate as someone put it to me the
 
01:51:40.850 --> 01:51:40.860 align:start position:0%
other day how mundane this experience is
 
01:51:44.330 --> 01:51:44.340 align:start position:0%
for the majority of people in our state
 
01:51:46.609 --> 01:51:46.619 align:start position:0%
the police coming into your home
 
01:51:49.370 --> 01:51:49.380 align:start position:0%
unannounced terrorizing you and your
 
01:51:52.490 --> 01:51:52.500 align:start position:0%
family being a mundane experience for
 
01:51:55.250 --> 01:51:55.260 align:start position:0%
most people is truly a sad State of
 
01:51:55.260 --> 01:51:56.390 align:start position:0%
most people is truly a sad State of
Affairs

01:51:56.390 --> 01:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
Affairs
 
01:51:58.790 --> 01:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
I understand why policing is so critical
 
01:52:00.649 --> 01:52:00.659 align:start position:0%
and have a great respect for the work
 
01:52:03.729 --> 01:52:03.739 align:start position:0%
law enforcement does I also understand
 
01:52:06.709 --> 01:52:06.719 align:start position:0%
the great distrust the People Back Home
 
01:52:08.570 --> 01:52:08.580 align:start position:0%
are starting to feel about law
 
01:52:08.580 --> 01:52:09.649 align:start position:0%
are starting to feel about law
enforcement

01:52:09.649 --> 01:52:09.659 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
01:52:12.470 --> 01:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
in many instances policy makers have let
 
01:52:14.570 --> 01:52:14.580 align:start position:0%
them go too far
 
01:52:16.970 --> 01:52:16.980 align:start position:0%
we here today have an opportunity to
 
01:52:19.310 --> 01:52:19.320 align:start position:0%
correct that balance and while we are
 
01:52:20.870 --> 01:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
not going to quell all of the anger
 
01:52:22.250 --> 01:52:22.260 align:start position:0%
which exists and then we have an
 
01:52:24.470 --> 01:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity to quell some of the anger
 
01:52:26.570 --> 01:52:26.580 align:start position:0%
which exists in our people by telling
 
01:52:29.270 --> 01:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
the boot stepping on their neck
 
01:52:33.530 --> 01:52:33.540 align:start position:0%
it's a step a little less hard and I ask
 
01:52:35.930 --> 01:52:35.940 align:start position:0%
you to join me in support and voting
 
01:52:37.970 --> 01:52:37.980 align:start position:0%
against this committee Amendment so that
 
01:52:40.609 --> 01:52:40.619 align:start position:0%
we can support a bill that actually bans
 
01:52:42.950 --> 01:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
no knock warrants instead of one which
 
01:52:44.570 --> 01:52:44.580 align:start position:0%
leaves the practice up to the discretion
 
01:52:46.609 --> 01:52:46.619 align:start position:0%
of the police department carrying out
 
01:52:48.890 --> 01:52:48.900 align:start position:0%
the warrant thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:52:56.270 --> 01:52:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:58.609 --> 01:52:58.619 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:53:01.609 --> 01:53:01.619 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker this amendment
 
01:53:03.590 --> 01:53:03.600 align:start position:0%
takes into account
 
01:53:07.669 --> 01:53:07.679 align:start position:0%
the need while extremely rare to have
 
01:53:09.229 --> 01:53:09.239 align:start position:0%
this in the toolbox of our law
 
01:53:09.239 --> 01:53:12.709 align:start position:0%
this in the toolbox of our law
enforcement

01:53:12.709 --> 01:53:12.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:15.770 --> 01:53:15.780 align:start position:0%
to do away with no knock warrants
 
01:53:15.780 --> 01:53:17.510 align:start position:0%
to do away with no knock warrants
totally

01:53:17.510 --> 01:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
totally
 
01:53:21.290 --> 01:53:21.300 align:start position:0%
puts lives at danger police lives
 
01:53:21.300 --> 01:53:22.729 align:start position:0%
puts lives at danger police lives
imagine

01:53:22.729 --> 01:53:22.739 align:start position:0%
imagine
 
01:53:25.370 --> 01:53:25.380 align:start position:0%
you have to serve a search warrant on an
 
01:53:25.380 --> 01:53:26.390 align:start position:0%
you have to serve a search warrant on an
apartment

01:53:26.390 --> 01:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
apartment
 
01:53:29.750 --> 01:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
and inside are five MS-13 members with
 
01:53:31.250 --> 01:53:31.260 align:start position:0%
machine guns
 
01:53:32.990 --> 01:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
and you have to knock on the door and
 
01:53:35.450 --> 01:53:35.460 align:start position:0%
tell them you're there
 
01:53:38.330 --> 01:53:38.340 align:start position:0%
not a not a good way to enter
 
01:53:41.270 --> 01:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
imagine you have to search
 
01:53:43.129 --> 01:53:43.139 align:start position:0%
an apartment
 
01:53:45.649 --> 01:53:45.659 align:start position:0%
and the person on the other side of the
 
01:53:45.659 --> 01:53:48.050 align:start position:0%
and the person on the other side of the
door

01:53:48.050 --> 01:53:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:51.590 --> 01:53:51.600 align:start position:0%
is with his wife and he told her I'm
 
01:53:53.629 --> 01:53:53.639 align:start position:0%
going to kill you if you ever call the
 
01:53:55.430 --> 01:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
cops on me
 
01:53:59.390 --> 01:53:59.400 align:start position:0%
so should they knock on the door and say
 
01:54:01.370 --> 01:54:01.380 align:start position:0%
hi police
 
01:54:03.770 --> 01:54:03.780 align:start position:0%
or should they get in there and rescue
 
01:54:05.270 --> 01:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
that person
 
01:54:07.129 --> 01:54:07.139 align:start position:0%
now we heard testimony from the New
 
01:54:08.870 --> 01:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Police
 
01:54:11.510 --> 01:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
and from the Manchester State Manchester
 
01:54:13.910 --> 01:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
police from their special tactics unit
 
01:54:16.250 --> 01:54:16.260 align:start position:0%
they said these you these type of
 
01:54:18.649 --> 01:54:18.659 align:start position:0%
warrants are so rare they couldn't even
 
01:54:20.330 --> 01:54:20.340 align:start position:0%
remember the last time they had to do
 
01:54:23.270 --> 01:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
one but they begged us please don't take
 
01:54:26.570 --> 01:54:26.580 align:start position:0%
them away because it can be very
 
01:54:29.149 --> 01:54:29.159 align:start position:0%
dangerous in certain rare circumstances
 
01:54:32.390 --> 01:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
to knock on that door and say police
 
01:54:35.149 --> 01:54:35.159 align:start position:0%
search warrant because that gives the
 
01:54:36.709 --> 01:54:36.719 align:start position:0%
person on the other side of the door
 
01:54:39.290 --> 01:54:39.300 align:start position:0%
just enough time to get ready to kill
 
01:54:39.300 --> 01:54:40.310 align:start position:0%
just enough time to get ready to kill
you

01:54:40.310 --> 01:54:40.320 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:54:42.470 --> 01:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
it's easy for us to sit here safe in
 
01:54:44.390 --> 01:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
this Hall but picture three in the
 
01:54:46.490 --> 01:54:46.500 align:start position:0%
morning having a kick in a door when you
 
01:54:47.810 --> 01:54:47.820 align:start position:0%
know people on the other side have
 
01:54:50.209 --> 01:54:50.219 align:start position:0%
machine guns and they want to kill you
 
01:54:52.910 --> 01:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
taking that tool away even for rare
 
01:54:54.890 --> 01:54:54.900 align:start position:0%
circumstances is going to result in
 
01:54:57.890 --> 01:54:57.900 align:start position:0%
deaths of police officers and that's
 
01:54:57.900 --> 01:54:58.850 align:start position:0%
deaths of police officers and that's
wrong

01:54:58.850 --> 01:54:58.860 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
01:55:01.669 --> 01:55:01.679 align:start position:0%
so what did we do with this amendment we
 
01:55:03.830 --> 01:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
looked at the concerns
 
01:55:06.830 --> 01:55:06.840 align:start position:0%
and I took it seriously and I said okay
 
01:55:09.530 --> 01:55:09.540 align:start position:0%
let's see what the federal government
 
01:55:12.649 --> 01:55:12.659 align:start position:0%
right now under President Biden is doing
 
01:55:17.810 --> 01:55:17.820 align:start position:0%
he directed his doj to narrow these down
 
01:55:21.109 --> 01:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
so I took almost verbatim the language
 
01:55:23.510 --> 01:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Justice on what
 
01:55:25.870 --> 01:55:25.880 align:start position:0%
they require to use no knock warrants
 
01:55:28.129 --> 01:55:28.139 align:start position:0%
tailored it for New Hampshire and that
 
01:55:30.770 --> 01:55:30.780 align:start position:0%
is this amendment
 
01:55:32.450 --> 01:55:32.460 align:start position:0%
it says
 
01:55:35.930 --> 01:55:35.940 align:start position:0%
you cannot use no knock warrants to
 
01:55:37.790 --> 01:55:37.800 align:start position:0%
preserve evidence
 
01:55:40.550 --> 01:55:40.560 align:start position:0%
it used to be back in the day and maybe
 
01:55:43.430 --> 01:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
still is that drug dealers would keep
 
01:55:45.530 --> 01:55:45.540 align:start position:0%
their drugs their fentanyl whatever it
 
01:55:49.850 --> 01:55:49.860 align:start position:0%
is in the bathroom so when they heard
 
01:55:52.669 --> 01:55:52.679 align:start position:0%
police they'd go in there dump it flush
 
01:55:55.430 --> 01:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
it evidence gone that used to be the
 
01:55:57.709 --> 01:55:57.719 align:start position:0%
basis for a no knock warrant
 
01:55:59.810 --> 01:55:59.820 align:start position:0%
this prohibits that this amendment
 
01:56:02.450 --> 01:56:02.460 align:start position:0%
prohibits that the only reason you can
 
01:56:04.370 --> 01:56:04.380 align:start position:0%
get a new knock warrant now under this
 
01:56:08.030 --> 01:56:08.040 align:start position:0%
amendment would be to preserve life if
 
01:56:10.189 --> 01:56:10.199 align:start position:0%
you can articulate to your chief law
 
01:56:13.370 --> 01:56:13.380 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer that there's a
 
01:56:16.490 --> 01:56:16.500 align:start position:0%
reason that I fear for my life going in
 
01:56:19.910 --> 01:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
that door and you have to spell it out
 
01:56:22.550 --> 01:56:22.560 align:start position:0%
in the case of evidence
 
01:56:25.490 --> 01:56:25.500 align:start position:0%
it makes one exception and that is if
 
01:56:29.149 --> 01:56:29.159 align:start position:0%
the evidence is to deal with human life
 
01:56:31.669 --> 01:56:31.679 align:start position:0%
for example if there's a computer in
 
01:56:33.709 --> 01:56:33.719 align:start position:0%
there and there's evidence of a pending
 
01:56:35.270 --> 01:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
terrorist attack
 
01:56:37.010 --> 01:56:37.020 align:start position:0%
and they can destroy it before they get
 
01:56:38.390 --> 01:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
in there that would be the only way they
 
01:56:40.370 --> 01:56:40.380 align:start position:0%
could use it to get evidence
 
01:56:42.470 --> 01:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
so it's been extremely limited extremely
 
01:56:45.709 --> 01:56:45.719 align:start position:0%
tailored and in that case mind you they
 
01:56:47.149 --> 01:56:47.159 align:start position:0%
have to get permission from the attorney
 
01:56:49.729 --> 01:56:49.739 align:start position:0%
general before they can even get such a
 
01:56:49.739 --> 01:56:50.990 align:start position:0%
general before they can even get such a
warrant

01:56:50.990 --> 01:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
warrant
 
01:56:54.109 --> 01:56:54.119 align:start position:0%
also the amendment creates the ability
 
01:56:56.990 --> 01:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
for the public to see what's going on if
 
01:56:59.330 --> 01:56:59.340 align:start position:0%
you went in to try and get a search
 
01:57:01.850 --> 01:57:01.860 align:start position:0%
warrant or the results prior to this
 
01:57:03.530 --> 01:57:03.540 align:start position:0%
you would have a very difficult time
 
01:57:06.410 --> 01:57:06.420 align:start position:0%
this amendment makes it so that those
 
01:57:08.870 --> 01:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
search warrant results and the affidavit
 
01:57:11.930 --> 01:57:11.940 align:start position:0%
behind them become immediately public
 
01:57:14.990 --> 01:57:15.000 align:start position:0%
so this amendment takes into concerns
 
01:57:17.629 --> 01:57:17.639 align:start position:0%
that people have about no knock search
 
01:57:19.970 --> 01:57:19.980 align:start position:0%
warrants they could no longer be used
 
01:57:22.089 --> 01:57:22.099 align:start position:0%
just to collect and preserve evidence
 
01:57:25.010 --> 01:57:25.020 align:start position:0%
only to protect the lives of the people
 
01:57:27.770 --> 01:57:27.780 align:start position:0%
inside like a domestic violence victim
 
01:57:29.930 --> 01:57:29.940 align:start position:0%
or the officers having to go in there
 
01:57:32.089 --> 01:57:32.099 align:start position:0%
because they can articulate that there's
 
01:57:33.770 --> 01:57:33.780 align:start position:0%
something or someone dangerous inside
 
01:57:35.390 --> 01:57:35.400 align:start position:0%
that house
 
01:57:38.510 --> 01:57:38.520 align:start position:0%
so I would ask you all close your eyes
 
01:57:41.390 --> 01:57:41.400 align:start position:0%
take yourself out of this safe reps Hall
 
01:57:44.089 --> 01:57:44.099 align:start position:0%
put on a uniform and pretend you have to
 
01:57:46.310 --> 01:57:46.320 align:start position:0%
go through a door on the other side of
 
01:57:48.169 --> 01:57:48.179 align:start position:0%
our people who have sworn to kill you
 
01:57:50.629 --> 01:57:50.639 align:start position:0%
but you have to tell them you're there
 
01:57:52.790 --> 01:57:52.800 align:start position:0%
thank you please support the committee
 
01:57:52.800 --> 01:57:57.050 align:start position:0%
thank you please support the committee
Amendment

01:57:57.050 --> 01:57:57.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:59.510 --> 01:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
the motion before us
 
01:58:02.209 --> 01:58:02.219 align:start position:0%
is on the amendment
 
01:58:06.229 --> 01:58:06.239 align:start position:0%
zero six eight four eight Senator has
 
01:58:08.030 --> 01:58:08.040 align:start position:0%
requested a roll call and that is
 
01:58:10.189 --> 01:58:10.199 align:start position:0%
sufficiently seconded this will be a
 
01:58:32.410 --> 01:58:32.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:41.270 --> 01:58:41.280 align:start position:0%

01:59:17.629 --> 01:59:17.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:21.169 --> 01:59:21.179 align:start position:0%
committee Amendment 0684h this is a roll
 
01:59:22.490 --> 01:59:22.500 align:start position:0%
call vote
 
01:59:24.410 --> 01:59:24.420 align:start position:0%
chair recognized representative Hull for
 
01:59:29.270 --> 01:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:32.930 --> 01:59:32.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:34.669 --> 01:59:34.679 align:start position:0%
if I know
 
01:59:39.169 --> 01:59:39.179 align:start position:0%
that between 2010 and 2016
 
01:59:42.169 --> 01:59:42.179 align:start position:0%
81 civilians were killed and 13 officers
 
01:59:44.870 --> 01:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
lost their lives
 
01:59:48.169 --> 01:59:48.179 align:start position:0%
in no knock warrant raids
 
01:59:51.169 --> 01:59:51.179 align:start position:0%
if I know that MS-13 routinely doesn't
 
01:59:54.410 --> 01:59:54.420 align:start position:0%
own machine guns because the
 
01:59:58.910 --> 01:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
the on books price is 25 000 or more
 
02:00:01.010 --> 02:00:01.020 align:start position:0%
and probably not within their bank
 
02:00:01.020 --> 02:00:03.229 align:start position:0%
and probably not within their bank
account

02:00:03.229 --> 02:00:03.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:06.470 --> 02:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:09.050 --> 02:00:09.060 align:start position:0%
after hearing the story of the mayor
 
02:00:11.629 --> 02:00:11.639 align:start position:0%
from Berwyn Heights Maryland where the
 
02:00:13.910 --> 02:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
no knock warrant raid was on the wrong
 
02:00:13.920 --> 02:00:15.109 align:start position:0%
no knock warrant raid was on the wrong
person

02:00:15.109 --> 02:00:15.119 align:start position:0%
person
 
02:00:17.870 --> 02:00:17.880 align:start position:0%
if I know lastly that in speaking with a
 
02:00:20.810 --> 02:00:20.820 align:start position:0%
House member who's a landlord today that
 
02:00:22.250 --> 02:00:22.260 align:start position:0%
the tenant that they were going after
 
02:00:25.310 --> 02:00:25.320 align:start position:0%
had moved out and a new tenant was in
 
02:00:27.530 --> 02:00:27.540 align:start position:0%
his apartment building and they raided
 
02:00:28.910 --> 02:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
the wrong family
 
02:00:31.189 --> 02:00:31.199 align:start position:0%
would I now oppose the committee
 
02:00:35.209 --> 02:00:35.219 align:start position:0%
Amendment and stop this
 
02:00:38.510 --> 02:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
and then work on draft crafting a narrow
 
02:00:43.790 --> 02:00:43.800 align:start position:0%
exemption maybe in the Senate thank you
 
02:00:45.770 --> 02:00:45.780 align:start position:0%
I recognize the representative Roy for a
 
02:00:48.830 --> 02:00:48.840 align:start position:0%

Mr Speaker I'll keep this short this
 
02:12:05.030 --> 02:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
amendment and Bill were considered by
 
02:12:06.530 --> 02:12:06.540 align:start position:0%

this

02:12:07.970 --> 02:12:07.980 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:12:11.870 --> 02:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
Bill and its Amendment as adopted
 
02:12:14.270 --> 02:12:14.280 align:start position:0%
would infringe upon the rights of people
 
02:12:16.609 --> 02:12:16.619 align:start position:0%
to keep firearms in their home and
 
02:12:16.619 --> 02:12:18.050 align:start position:0%
to keep firearms in their home and
accessible

02:12:18.050 --> 02:12:18.060 align:start position:0%
accessible
 
02:12:19.910 --> 02:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
to be used
 
02:12:22.490 --> 02:12:22.500 align:start position:0%
and that's really the bottom line
 
02:12:24.649 --> 02:12:24.659 align:start position:0%
it doesn't need to be discussed and
 
02:12:27.169 --> 02:12:27.179 align:start position:0%
debated to death it means that you
 
02:12:28.490 --> 02:12:28.500 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to have your firearm
 
02:12:30.770 --> 02:12:30.780 align:start position:0%
accessible without being subject to a
 
02:12:30.780 --> 02:12:32.030 align:start position:0%
accessible without being subject to a
penalty

02:12:32.030 --> 02:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
penalty
 
02:12:32.040 --> 02:12:33.709 align:start position:0%
penalty
and

02:12:33.709 --> 02:12:33.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:12:36.169 --> 02:12:36.179 align:start position:0%
that's not what the courts ruled the
 
02:12:38.810 --> 02:12:38.820 align:start position:0%
courts have ruled that you have to a
 
02:12:41.450 --> 02:12:41.460 align:start position:0%
firearm inaccessible is not a firearm
 
02:12:42.530 --> 02:12:42.540 align:start position:0%
for you to use
 
02:12:45.050 --> 02:12:45.060 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court said as much now the
 
02:12:47.089 --> 02:12:47.099 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court has said that reasonable
 
02:12:49.430 --> 02:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
restrictions as I'm sure you will hear
 
02:12:51.649 --> 02:12:51.659 align:start position:0%
are authorized but they all specifically
 
02:12:53.750 --> 02:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
said having a firearm so that you can't
 
02:12:56.149 --> 02:12:56.159 align:start position:0%
get at it is the same as having none at
 
02:12:58.250 --> 02:12:58.260 align:start position:0%
all so please
 
02:13:00.109 --> 02:13:00.119 align:start position:0%
vote the correct way on this and vote
 
02:13:01.790 --> 02:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
against it thank you
 
02:13:08.930 --> 02:13:08.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:11.089 --> 02:13:11.099 align:start position:0%
I think you will keep this brief what
 
02:13:13.250 --> 02:13:13.260 align:start position:0%
the amendment actually does is remove
 
02:13:15.229 --> 02:13:15.239 align:start position:0%
the part of the bill that requires a

agree with please vote for the amendment
 
02:13:27.530 --> 02:13:27.540 align:start position:0%
the committee actually supported the
 
02:13:31.729 --> 02:13:31.739 align:start position:0%
amendment by a bipartisan 17 to 2 vote
 
02:13:34.010 --> 02:13:34.020 align:start position:0%

yeah this is um
 
02:17:11.209 --> 02:17:11.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:13.969 --> 02:17:13.979 align:start position:0%
if I have the rights
 
02:17:17.150 --> 02:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
keep my firearms in my home however I
 
02:17:19.190 --> 02:17:19.200 align:start position:0%
feel that I need to keep them in order
 
02:17:22.429 --> 02:17:22.439 align:start position:0%
to keep my family safe at all times
 
02:17:26.330 --> 02:17:26.340 align:start position:0%
and if it is illegal already to
 
02:17:31.669 --> 02:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:33.950 --> 02:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
what I just
 
02:17:37.730 --> 02:17:37.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:49.429 --> 02:17:49.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:57.530 --> 02:17:57.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:00.530 --> 02:18:00.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:04.310 --> 02:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
HB 351 is a bill that will have zero
 
02:18:07.310 --> 02:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
impact on responsible gun owners
 
02:18:09.230 --> 02:18:09.240 align:start position:0%
that's because responsible gun owners
 
02:18:11.870 --> 02:18:11.880 align:start position:0%
would never leave an unattended firearm
 
02:18:14.389 --> 02:18:14.399 align:start position:0%
or ammunition in any place where it
 
02:18:16.910 --> 02:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
could be accessed by a child
 
02:18:19.429 --> 02:18:19.439 align:start position:0%
what the bill does is extend and toughen
 
02:18:21.410 --> 02:18:21.420 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's existing state policy
 
02:18:23.450 --> 02:18:23.460 align:start position:0%
and penalties when it comes to
 
02:18:25.549 --> 02:18:25.559 align:start position:0%
irresponsible gun owners who leave
 
02:18:28.310 --> 02:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
unattended Firearms where children can
 
02:18:29.929 --> 02:18:29.939 align:start position:0%
access them
 
02:18:32.389 --> 02:18:32.399 align:start position:0%
it also requires that all firearms
 
02:18:34.490 --> 02:18:34.500 align:start position:0%
commercially sold or transferred be
 
02:18:37.910 --> 02:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
accompanied by a locking safety device
 
02:18:40.009 --> 02:18:40.019 align:start position:0%
currently our state has no laws
 
02:18:43.190 --> 02:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
regarding safe firearm storage we do
 
02:18:45.230 --> 02:18:45.240 align:start position:0%
have an existing law that addresses
 
02:18:48.169 --> 02:18:48.179 align:start position:0%
Firearms negligence in children but that
 
02:18:50.509 --> 02:18:50.519 align:start position:0%
law is extremely weak
 
02:18:52.969 --> 02:18:52.979 align:start position:0%
under the current law if a child finds
 
02:18:54.889 --> 02:18:54.899 align:start position:0%
an unsecured firearm and takes it to a
 
02:18:57.290 --> 02:18:57.300 align:start position:0%
school a playground or to a neighbor's
 
02:18:59.150 --> 02:18:59.160 align:start position:0%
house where they play with it with other
 
02:19:02.150 --> 02:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
children the owner of the gun can't be
 
02:19:02.160 --> 02:19:03.290 align:start position:0%
children the owner of the gun can't be
charged

02:19:03.290 --> 02:19:03.300 align:start position:0%
charged
 
02:19:05.089 --> 02:19:05.099 align:start position:0%
that's because to bring a charge under
 
02:19:07.129 --> 02:19:07.139 align:start position:0%
our current law one of three other
 
02:19:09.469 --> 02:19:09.479 align:start position:0%
things also needs to happen
 
02:19:12.589 --> 02:19:12.599 align:start position:0%
the child also has to use the gun in a
 
02:19:14.330 --> 02:19:14.340 align:start position:0%
reckless or threatening manner
 
02:19:17.450 --> 02:19:17.460 align:start position:0%
or the child has to discharge the gun in
 
02:19:20.030 --> 02:19:20.040 align:start position:0%
a reckless or threatening manner or the
 
02:19:22.610 --> 02:19:22.620 align:start position:0%
child has to commit a felony or a
 
02:19:24.530 --> 02:19:24.540 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor with it
 
02:19:26.509 --> 02:19:26.519 align:start position:0%
so basically what we have now here in
 
02:19:28.610 --> 02:19:28.620 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is a no harm no foul law
 
02:19:31.190 --> 02:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
with a maximum penalty of a one thousand
 
02:19:32.750 --> 02:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
dollar violation
 
02:19:35.629 --> 02:19:35.639 align:start position:0%
even if a child or another person loses
 
02:19:38.270 --> 02:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
their life as a result
 
02:19:41.030 --> 02:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire data on shootings of
 
02:19:42.950 --> 02:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
involving young children accessing
 
02:19:45.230 --> 02:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
unsecured Firearms can be very difficult
 
02:19:46.490 --> 02:19:46.500 align:start position:0%
to find
 
02:19:49.130 --> 02:19:49.140 align:start position:0%
this data isn't tracked in any sort of a
 
02:19:50.990 --> 02:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
centralized database either at the state
 
02:19:53.690 --> 02:19:53.700 align:start position:0%
level or at the federal level
 
02:19:55.670 --> 02:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
because these incidents involve
 
02:19:57.889 --> 02:19:57.899 align:start position:0%
juveniles police and court records are
 
02:20:00.410 --> 02:20:00.420 align:start position:0%
often sealed and the media is very
 
02:20:02.630 --> 02:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
reluctant to report them
 
02:20:05.210 --> 02:20:05.220 align:start position:0%
but these incidents are happening in our
 
02:20:05.220 --> 02:20:06.050 align:start position:0%
but these incidents are happening in our
state

02:20:06.050 --> 02:20:06.060 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:20:08.389 --> 02:20:08.399 align:start position:0%
a four-year-old boy shot himself in the
 
02:20:10.910 --> 02:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
hand in 2021 and where
 
02:20:13.610 --> 02:20:13.620 align:start position:0%
an 11 year old boy in Alton who accessed
 
02:20:16.910 --> 02:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
a loaded unsecured firearm fatally shot
 
02:20:18.830 --> 02:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
both of his parents
 
02:20:20.990 --> 02:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
a ten-year-old boy in a Durham home
 
02:20:22.849 --> 02:20:22.859 align:start position:0%
filled with unsecured guns and
 
02:20:25.670 --> 02:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
ammunition fatally shot himself back in
 
02:20:25.680 --> 02:20:27.410 align:start position:0%
ammunition fatally shot himself back in
2016.

02:20:27.410 --> 02:20:27.420 align:start position:0%
2016.
 
02:20:29.450 --> 02:20:29.460 align:start position:0%
the Durham case is especially
 
02:20:31.550 --> 02:20:31.560 align:start position:0%
interesting because the prosecutor chose
 
02:20:33.950 --> 02:20:33.960 align:start position:0%
not to prosecute the gun owner despite
 
02:20:36.230 --> 02:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
the fact that the gun the child used to
 
02:20:40.490 --> 02:20:40.500 align:start position:0%
take his life was unsecured so how could
 
02:20:42.349 --> 02:20:42.359 align:start position:0%
that be
 
02:20:44.630 --> 02:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
because our current law only covers
 
02:20:47.870 --> 02:20:47.880 align:start position:0%
loaded weapons that are unsecured in the
 
02:20:50.389 --> 02:20:50.399 align:start position:0%
Durham case the unsecured weapon was
 
02:20:53.150 --> 02:20:53.160 align:start position:0%
unloaded but the ammunition for it was
 
02:20:53.160 --> 02:20:54.469 align:start position:0%
unloaded but the ammunition for it was
nearby

02:20:54.469 --> 02:20:54.479 align:start position:0%
nearby
 
02:20:56.809 --> 02:20:56.819 align:start position:0%
needless to say the child was able to
 
02:20:59.630 --> 02:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
put two and two together with tragic
 
02:20:59.640 --> 02:21:01.550 align:start position:0%
put two and two together with tragic
results

02:21:01.550 --> 02:21:01.560 align:start position:0%
results
 
02:21:03.349 --> 02:21:03.359 align:start position:0%
one of the things that this bill will do
 
02:21:05.929 --> 02:21:05.939 align:start position:0%
is fix that flaw in the law
 
02:21:08.389 --> 02:21:08.399 align:start position:0%
the bill will also broaden the
 
02:21:10.670 --> 02:21:10.680 align:start position:0%
circumstances that constitute negligence
 
02:21:13.849 --> 02:21:13.859 align:start position:0%
so in addition to child a child using or
 
02:21:15.710 --> 02:21:15.720 align:start position:0%
discharging the gun in a reckless manner
 
02:21:18.110 --> 02:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
or using it to commit a crime it will
 
02:21:20.630 --> 02:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
expand the scope of the law to a child
 
02:21:22.670 --> 02:21:22.680 align:start position:0%
displaying the weapon to others or
 
02:21:24.950 --> 02:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
bringing the weapon onto the grounds of
 
02:21:26.990 --> 02:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
a school or any facility public or
 
02:21:29.150 --> 02:21:29.160 align:start position:0%
private that's accessible to members of
 
02:21:30.710 --> 02:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
the public where other people are
 
02:21:30.720 --> 02:21:32.210 align:start position:0%
the public where other people are
present

02:21:32.210 --> 02:21:32.220 align:start position:0%
present
 
02:21:35.030 --> 02:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
the bill also toughens penalties for an
 
02:21:35.040 --> 02:21:36.050 align:start position:0%
the bill also toughens penalties for an
offense

02:21:36.050 --> 02:21:36.060 align:start position:0%
offense
 
02:21:38.570 --> 02:21:38.580 align:start position:0%
instead of a violation and a maximum one
 
02:21:40.790 --> 02:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar fine a negligent gun
 
02:21:42.110 --> 02:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
owner would be charged with an
 
02:21:44.450 --> 02:21:44.460 align:start position:0%
unclassified misdemeanor and if the
 
02:21:46.849 --> 02:21:46.859 align:start position:0%
child discharges the weapon resulting in
 
02:21:48.650 --> 02:21:48.660 align:start position:0%
the injury or death of the child or
 
02:21:51.110 --> 02:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
another person that penalty would be
 
02:21:53.990 --> 02:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
elevated to a class B felony
 
02:21:55.969 --> 02:21:55.979 align:start position:0%
the penalty also would increase to a
 
02:21:58.910 --> 02:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
class B felony If the child uses the
 
02:22:02.929 --> 02:22:02.939 align:start position:0%
weapon in the commission of a felony
 
02:22:02.939 --> 02:22:04.070 align:start position:0%
weapon in the commission of a felony
here

02:22:04.070 --> 02:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:22:06.410 --> 02:22:06.420 align:start position:0%
Bill won't do is compound a tragedy by
 
02:22:08.570 --> 02:22:08.580 align:start position:0%
charging a parent whose child is killed
 
02:22:11.389 --> 02:22:11.399 align:start position:0%
or injured with a crime unless the
 
02:22:14.510 --> 02:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
situation involves gross negligence and
 
02:22:17.570 --> 02:22:17.580 align:start position:0%
that by the way is exactly how our
 
02:22:20.270 --> 02:22:20.280 align:start position:0%
current law operates there's nothing in
 
02:22:22.370 --> 02:22:22.380 align:start position:0%
this bill that actually removes that
 
02:22:24.590 --> 02:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
particular exemption
 
02:22:26.570 --> 02:22:26.580 align:start position:0%
so in a state where guns are part of our
 
02:22:28.969 --> 02:22:28.979 align:start position:0%
culture taking responsibility to protect
 
02:22:30.950 --> 02:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
our kids from the very real risk that
 
02:22:34.429 --> 02:22:34.439 align:start position:0%
unsecured Firearms present must also be
 
02:22:36.110 --> 02:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
part of our culture
 
02:22:40.070 --> 02:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
HB 351 would encourage this by making it
 
02:22:43.070 --> 02:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
a stronger part of New Hampshire law
 
02:22:45.590 --> 02:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
colleagues our choice today is to pass a
 
02:22:47.030 --> 02:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
bill that would better protect children
 
02:22:50.450 --> 02:22:50.460 align:start position:0%
who look to adults like us to protect
 
02:22:50.460 --> 02:22:51.349 align:start position:0%
who look to adults like us to protect
them

02:22:51.349 --> 02:22:51.359 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:22:53.450 --> 02:22:53.460 align:start position:0%
or to allow a small minority of
 
02:22:56.150 --> 02:22:56.160 align:start position:0%
irresponsible adults to remain virtually
 
02:22:59.510 --> 02:22:59.520 align:start position:0%

02:33:47.750 --> 02:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
Constitution it had quote built a wall
 
02:33:51.889 --> 02:33:51.899 align:start position:0%
of separation between church and state
 
02:33:54.230 --> 02:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
even though there is an established
 
02:33:56.389 --> 02:33:56.399 align:start position:0%
tradition in our state and our
 
02:33:58.670 --> 02:33:58.680 align:start position:0%
constitution to practice the separation
 
02:34:02.349 --> 02:34:02.359 align:start position:0%
of church and state Advocates of CR
 
02:34:07.550 --> 02:34:07.560 align:start position:0%
cacr7 want to repeal the 1877 amendment
 
02:34:09.830 --> 02:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
to our Constitution which further
 
02:34:12.410 --> 02:34:12.420 align:start position:0%
instilled the concept that the public
 
02:34:14.510 --> 02:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
collected tax dollars should not be
 
02:34:18.110 --> 02:34:18.120 align:start position:0%
allocated to religious institutions
 
02:34:21.530 --> 02:34:21.540 align:start position:0%
at our Arctic at issue is article 83 of
 
02:34:24.830 --> 02:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
our Constitution which states quote no
 
02:34:27.889 --> 02:34:27.899 align:start position:0%
money raised by taxation shall ever be
 
02:34:30.950 --> 02:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
granted or applied for the use of
 
02:34:33.770 --> 02:34:33.780 align:start position:0%
schools or institution of any religious
 
02:34:37.670 --> 02:34:37.680 align:start position:0%
sector or denomination end quote
 
02:34:40.490 --> 02:34:40.500 align:start position:0%
now this is the blame Amendment
 
02:34:43.010 --> 02:34:43.020 align:start position:0%
admittedly at the time when Maine
 
02:34:45.469 --> 02:34:45.479 align:start position:0%
Senator Blaine brought forth this issue
 
02:34:49.130 --> 02:34:49.140 align:start position:0%
to the U.S Congress it was anti-catholic
 
02:34:51.170 --> 02:34:51.180 align:start position:0%
and anti-immigrant
 
02:34:53.570 --> 02:34:53.580 align:start position:0%
even though it reflected the tradition
 
02:34:56.330 --> 02:34:56.340 align:start position:0%
that no public taxes should go to
 
02:34:59.090 --> 02:34:59.100 align:start position:0%
sectarian education it was in fact
 
02:34:59.100 --> 02:35:01.370 align:start position:0%
sectarian education it was in fact
mean-spirited

02:35:01.370 --> 02:35:01.380 align:start position:0%
mean-spirited
 
02:35:01.380 --> 02:35:02.870 align:start position:0%
mean-spirited
however

02:35:02.870 --> 02:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
however
 
02:35:06.670 --> 02:35:06.680 align:start position:0%
39 States both at the time and later
 
02:35:09.170 --> 02:35:09.180 align:start position:0%
later states admitted like Washington
 
02:35:12.290 --> 02:35:12.300 align:start position:0%
state Alaska and Hawaii adopted the
 
02:35:14.270 --> 02:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
concept of no funding of religious
 
02:35:16.370 --> 02:35:16.380 align:start position:0%
schools with public Monies
 
02:35:21.050 --> 02:35:21.060 align:start position:0%
according to ballot media only two
 
02:35:22.670 --> 02:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
states have repealed the Blaine
 
02:35:25.309 --> 02:35:25.319 align:start position:0%
amendment in their constitution
 
02:35:28.070 --> 02:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
it should be noted that the no Aid
 
02:35:30.170 --> 02:35:30.180 align:start position:0%
Clause of part 1 article 6 of our
 
02:35:32.929 --> 02:35:32.939 align:start position:0%
constitution predates the blame
 
02:35:36.050 --> 02:35:36.060 align:start position:0%
amendment by almost a hundred years
 
02:35:39.830 --> 02:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
the concept presented in article 83 is
 
02:35:43.130 --> 02:35:43.140 align:start position:0%
not Antiquated is not outdated it is
 
02:35:45.889 --> 02:35:45.899 align:start position:0%
fund a fundamental tenet of the
 
02:35:48.770 --> 02:35:48.780 align:start position:0%
foundation of our state and our nation
 
02:35:52.610 --> 02:35:52.620 align:start position:0%
now supporters of cacr7 will cite
 
02:35:54.650 --> 02:35:54.660 align:start position:0%
several U.S Supreme Courts that rule
 
02:35:57.410 --> 02:35:57.420 align:start position:0%
that public monies could be allocated to
 
02:35:59.210 --> 02:35:59.220 align:start position:0%
religious institutions
 
02:36:01.429 --> 02:36:01.439 align:start position:0%
now these decisions were obviously
 
02:36:04.429 --> 02:36:04.439 align:start position:0%
narrowly drawn they were drawn based on
 
02:36:06.469 --> 02:36:06.479 align:start position:0%
the focus of deteriorating Cleveland
 
02:36:07.910 --> 02:36:07.920 align:start position:0%

playground the use of Private Business
 
02:36:16.969 --> 02:36:16.979 align:start position:0%
profit taxes and the assistance to a
 
02:36:18.830 --> 02:36:18.840 align:start position:0%
rural School District
 
02:36:21.349 --> 02:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
most of our con most of our constituents
 
02:36:24.349 --> 02:36:24.359 align:start position:0%
concur with the Jeffersonian belief that
 
02:36:26.690 --> 02:36:26.700 align:start position:0%
the in the concept of the separation of
 
02:36:28.190 --> 02:36:28.200 align:start position:0%
church and state
 
02:36:30.889 --> 02:36:30.899 align:start position:0%
that guarantees that no tax dollars will
 
02:36:33.830 --> 02:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
support any religious Institution
 
02:36:36.830 --> 02:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
I have always felt that the practice of
 
02:36:40.790 --> 02:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
one's faith is a private personal matter
 
02:36:43.670 --> 02:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
our ancestors understood this the New
 
02:36:46.550 --> 02:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution also charges the
 
02:36:48.349 --> 02:36:48.359 align:start position:0%
state with the responsibility and the
 
02:36:50.690 --> 02:36:50.700 align:start position:0%
obligation to provide adequate public
 
02:36:52.790 --> 02:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
education to all New Hampshire students
 
02:36:55.790 --> 02:36:55.800 align:start position:0%
through their Public Schools it stands
 
02:36:58.849 --> 02:36:58.859 align:start position:0%
to reason that allocating Public's guns
 
02:37:01.130 --> 02:37:01.140 align:start position:0%
to private or religious schools without
 
02:37:04.130 --> 02:37:04.140 align:start position:0%
extenuating circumstances but only
 
02:37:06.650 --> 02:37:06.660 align:start position:0%
further violate this principle
 
02:37:09.230 --> 02:37:09.240 align:start position:0%
colleagues I urge you to support our
 
02:37:11.469 --> 02:37:11.479 align:start position:0%
Constitution and the Jeffersonian
 
02:37:13.790 --> 02:37:13.800 align:start position:0%
principle of the separation of church
 
02:37:18.110 --> 02:37:18.120 align:start position:0%
and state by voting no on cacr7 thank
 
02:37:20.450 --> 02:37:20.460 align:start position:0%
you Mr Speaker and I would call for a

02:37:36.650 --> 02:37:36.660 align:start position:0%
the motion before us has ought to pass
 
02:37:43.309 --> 02:37:43.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:45.590 --> 02:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
I recognize representative chair

thank you Mr Speaker
 
02:37:55.730 --> 02:37:55.740 align:start position:0%
chcr7 is a constitutional amendment to
 
02:37:57.650 --> 02:37:57.660 align:start position:0%
repeal the so-called blame Amendment
 
02:37:59.450 --> 02:37:59.460 align:start position:0%
from our constitution
 
02:38:03.190 --> 02:38:03.200 align:start position:0%
this 1877 amendment to our constitution
 
02:38:06.770 --> 02:38:06.780 align:start position:0%
basically said public funds cannot be
 
02:38:09.410 --> 02:38:09.420 align:start position:0%
granted to religious schools
 
02:38:11.450 --> 02:38:11.460 align:start position:0%
this amendment needs to be repealed for
 
02:38:13.070 --> 02:38:13.080 align:start position:0%
two simple reasons
 
02:38:13.080 --> 02:38:14.210 align:start position:0%
two simple reasons
first

02:38:14.210 --> 02:38:14.220 align:start position:0%
first
 
02:38:17.050 --> 02:38:17.060 align:start position:0%
it is a relic of an anti-catholic
 
02:38:20.929 --> 02:38:20.939 align:start position:0%
anti-religious bigotry of the 1800s
 
02:38:23.809 --> 02:38:23.819 align:start position:0%
it was placed in our constitution as a
 
02:38:26.389 --> 02:38:26.399 align:start position:0%
result of that bigotry because public
 
02:38:29.389 --> 02:38:29.399 align:start position:0%
schools of that era were Protestant
 
02:38:31.429 --> 02:38:31.439 align:start position:0%
schools and taught from Protestant
 
02:38:31.439 --> 02:38:32.750 align:start position:0%

Bibles
 
02:38:35.150 --> 02:38:35.160 align:start position:0%
when Catholics and other immigrants
 
02:38:36.830 --> 02:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
started arriving in this country and
 
02:38:40.670 --> 02:38:40.680 align:start position:0%
found that they wanted to have their own
 
02:38:43.309 --> 02:38:43.319 align:start position:0%
schools and their own religion taught in
 
02:38:45.530 --> 02:38:45.540 align:start position:0%
those schools
 
02:38:48.650 --> 02:38:48.660 align:start position:0%
this led to discrimination and violence
 
02:38:52.670 --> 02:38:52.680 align:start position:0%
in Philadelphia there were Bible riots
 
02:38:55.450 --> 02:38:55.460 align:start position:0%
on which version of the Bible to be used
 
02:38:58.790 --> 02:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
in Maine a Catholic Church was burned
 
02:39:01.309 --> 02:39:01.319 align:start position:0%
and the priest was tarred and feathered
 
02:39:03.889 --> 02:39:03.899 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire there were attempts to
 
02:39:05.870 --> 02:39:05.880 align:start position:0%
burn down churches in Dover and
 
02:39:08.090 --> 02:39:08.100 align:start position:0%
Manchester and these were not isolated

one vote in the U.S Senate
 
02:39:36.770 --> 02:39:36.780 align:start position:0%
but the anti-catholic movement continued
 
02:39:39.170 --> 02:39:39.180 align:start position:0%
and many blame amendments were added to
 
02:39:41.990 --> 02:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
state constitutions including our

ought to pass
 
04:10:45.050 --> 04:10:45.060 align:start position:0%

04:10:53.229 --> 04:10:53.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
04:10:56.570 --> 04:10:56.580 align:start position:0%
and this bill pertains to school boards
 
04:10:58.550 --> 04:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
in towns where the community Public
 
04:11:00.830 --> 04:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
Schools do not include include a
 
04:11:04.010 --> 04:11:04.020 align:start position:0%
complete K-12 program and they contract
 
04:11:05.389 --> 04:11:05.399 align:start position:0%
with other schools to provide an
 
04:11:07.189 --> 04:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
adequate education for the remaining
 
04:11:07.199 --> 04:11:08.330 align:start position:0%
adequate education for the remaining
grades

04:11:08.330 --> 04:11:08.340 align:start position:0%
grades
 
04:11:10.969 --> 04:11:10.979 align:start position:0%
the contract establishes the lower
 
04:11:13.010 --> 04:11:13.020 align:start position:0%
taxpayer-funded tuition payment to the
 
04:11:15.410 --> 04:11:15.420 align:start position:0%
schools or sometimes there are several
 
04:11:17.750 --> 04:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
schools that they contract with to
 
04:11:20.689 --> 04:11:20.699 align:start position:0%
provide the remaining grades in the case
 
04:11:22.729 --> 04:11:22.739 align:start position:0%
of choices school boards may enter into
 
04:11:24.349 --> 04:11:24.359 align:start position:0%
different tuition agreements with the
 
04:11:26.269 --> 04:11:26.279 align:start position:0%
different schools and in some
 
04:11:28.370 --> 04:11:28.380 align:start position:0%
circumstances School boards have like a
 
04:11:30.610 --> 04:11:30.620 align:start position:0%
cap on tuition
 
04:11:33.290 --> 04:11:33.300 align:start position:0%
this bill allows a parent who wishes to
 
04:11:35.450 --> 04:11:35.460 align:start position:0%
enroll their child in a school whose
 
04:11:37.070 --> 04:11:37.080 align:start position:0%
tuition cost is more than the local
 
04:11:38.590 --> 04:11:38.600 align:start position:0%
tuition cap
 
04:11:41.030 --> 04:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
allows the parents to pay the additional
 
04:11:41.040 --> 04:11:41.990 align:start position:0%
allows the parents to pay the additional
funds

04:11:41.990 --> 04:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
funds
 
04:11:43.610 --> 04:11:43.620 align:start position:0%
these parents are often looking for
 
04:11:45.229 --> 04:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
special academic programs Sports
 
04:11:47.269 --> 04:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
programs religious training or other
 
04:11:50.210 --> 04:11:50.220 align:start position:0%
benefits and the bill benefits a few
 
04:11:51.830 --> 04:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
while potentially affecting many
 
04:11:54.229 --> 04:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
students in the district
 
04:11:57.710 --> 04:11:57.720 align:start position:0%
what can and in fact has happened is
 
04:12:00.170 --> 04:12:00.180 align:start position:0%
that a school board in town for one
 
04:12:02.870 --> 04:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
reason or another sets a tuition payment
 
04:12:05.570 --> 04:12:05.580 align:start position:0%
that's low and that payment was lower
 
04:12:07.610 --> 04:12:07.620 align:start position:0%
than the tuition to the nearby public
 
04:12:07.620 --> 04:12:09.290 align:start position:0%
than the tuition to the nearby public
school

04:12:09.290 --> 04:12:09.300 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:12:11.389 --> 04:12:11.399 align:start position:0%
that was contracted with the town to
 
04:12:13.189 --> 04:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
provide education in grades they didn't
 
04:12:15.889 --> 04:12:15.899 align:start position:0%
offer the parents who wanted to continue
 
04:12:18.050 --> 04:12:18.060 align:start position:0%
to send their children to the public
 
04:12:20.750 --> 04:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
school which provides all the grades has
 
04:12:23.290 --> 04:12:23.300 align:start position:0%
Career and Technical education
 
04:12:25.790 --> 04:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
idea accommodations professionally
 
04:12:27.950 --> 04:12:27.960 align:start position:0%
licensed Educators co-curricular
 
04:12:30.950 --> 04:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
activities dual enrollment classes as
 
04:12:32.750 --> 04:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
well as providing an adequate education
 
04:12:35.269 --> 04:12:35.279 align:start position:0%
where these parents were in the position
 
04:12:39.410 --> 04:12:39.420 align:start position:0%
of paying a hefty extra tuition fee that
 
04:12:40.969 --> 04:12:40.979 align:start position:0%
they could not afford particularly if
 
04:12:43.610 --> 04:12:43.620 align:start position:0%
they had several kids luckily the town
 
04:12:45.889 --> 04:12:45.899 align:start position:0%
realized this inequity and supported
 
04:12:47.210 --> 04:12:47.220 align:start position:0%
full tuition
 
04:12:50.510 --> 04:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
so I feel this bill has some unintended
 
04:12:52.849 --> 04:12:52.859 align:start position:0%
consequences and it has a few flaws to
 
04:12:55.010 --> 04:12:55.020 align:start position:0%
it and certainly the amendment makes it
 
04:12:57.650 --> 04:12:57.660 align:start position:0%
better it puts into statute the
 
04:12:59.510 --> 04:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
possibility that a school board in town
 
04:13:02.030 --> 04:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
could set a tuition payment at a level
 
04:13:04.490 --> 04:13:04.500 align:start position:0%
that not only allows parents to pay
 
04:13:07.070 --> 04:13:07.080 align:start position:0%
tuition for these special hype class
 
04:13:08.929 --> 04:13:08.939 align:start position:0%
schools but it would also Force the
 
04:13:11.330 --> 04:13:11.340 align:start position:0%
majority of parents to pay for a free
 
04:13:13.849 --> 04:13:13.859 align:start position:0%
public education for their children or
 
04:13:16.550 --> 04:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
have homeschooling as an alternative so
 
04:13:18.530 --> 04:13:18.540 align:start position:0%
it kind of opens up Pandora's box of
 
04:13:20.150 --> 04:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
budgeting and other issues for school
 
04:13:22.670 --> 04:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
districts who are on the contract and
 
04:13:25.130 --> 04:13:25.140 align:start position:0%
puts an added Financial pressure on low
 
04:13:27.769 --> 04:13:27.779 align:start position:0%
and middle income parents who should not
 
04:13:29.750 --> 04:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
end up paying for a public school
 
04:13:32.090 --> 04:13:32.100 align:start position:0%
education for their children so I ask
 
04:13:34.729 --> 04:13:34.739 align:start position:0%
you to join me in voting itl on this
 
04:13:37.610 --> 04:13:37.620 align:start position:0%

04:13:48.050 --> 04:13:48.060 align:start position:0%
the school tuition program is a program
 
04:13:49.849 --> 04:13:49.859 align:start position:0%
you've had in the books here in the
 
04:13:52.429 --> 04:13:52.439 align:start position:0%
state for many many years same thing
 
04:13:54.950 --> 04:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
across the river in Vermont
 
04:13:56.210 --> 04:13:56.220 align:start position:0%
we have different kinds of
 
04:13:58.370 --> 04:13:58.380 align:start position:0%
configurations and structures of schools
 
04:14:00.110 --> 04:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about the tuition
 
04:14:03.769 --> 04:14:03.779 align:start position:0%
program we have k-5s we have k-4s we
 
04:14:06.050 --> 04:14:06.060 align:start position:0%
have K through eights and if you don't
 
04:14:08.689 --> 04:14:08.699 align:start position:0%
have the receiving facility in your own
 
04:14:11.389 --> 04:14:11.399 align:start position:0%
town for example grades 9 through 12 or
 
04:14:13.849 --> 04:14:13.859 align:start position:0%
possibly grades 5 through 12. you
 
04:14:16.790 --> 04:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
tuition them out the school board the
 
04:14:20.210 --> 04:14:20.220 align:start position:0%
sending School Board must approve the
 
04:14:22.670 --> 04:14:22.680 align:start position:0%
receiving school as part of the tuition
 
04:14:22.680 --> 04:14:24.410 align:start position:0%
receiving school as part of the tuition
program

04:14:24.410 --> 04:14:24.420 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:14:26.510 --> 04:14:26.520 align:start position:0%
now in the community I live in in
 
04:14:28.910 --> 04:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
communities which I represent this is
 
04:14:31.670 --> 04:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
occurring in two communities in landaf
 
04:14:33.769 --> 04:14:33.779 align:start position:0%
which is a small community which has the
 
04:14:35.150 --> 04:14:35.160 align:start position:0%
blue school which is approximately
 
04:14:38.330 --> 04:14:38.340 align:start position:0%
grades K through three roughly around 30
 
04:14:39.950 --> 04:14:39.960 align:start position:0%
some odd students
 
04:14:42.110 --> 04:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
they send their kids off there's a
 
04:14:44.389 --> 04:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
tuition agreements made with three
 
04:14:44.399 --> 04:14:46.130 align:start position:0%
tuition agreements made with three
locations

04:14:46.130 --> 04:14:46.140 align:start position:0%
locations
 
04:14:49.250 --> 04:14:49.260 align:start position:0%
Lisbon where the majority of kids go and
 
04:14:51.650 --> 04:14:51.660 align:start position:0%
transportation is provided and all those
 
04:14:54.170 --> 04:14:54.180 align:start position:0%
Services which were just mentioned are
 
04:14:56.150 --> 04:14:56.160 align:start position:0%
offered there so every student receives
 
04:14:57.590 --> 04:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for an adequate
 
04:14:59.870 --> 04:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
education but they also have two other
 
04:15:03.590 --> 04:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
schools profile going to the East and
 
04:15:06.530 --> 04:15:06.540 align:start position:0%
then St Johnsbury Academy to the west
 
04:15:08.570 --> 04:15:08.580 align:start position:0%
where there's two students taking this
 
04:15:10.790 --> 04:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
namely because that's where the parent
 
04:15:10.800 --> 04:15:12.050 align:start position:0%
namely because that's where the parent
works

04:15:12.050 --> 04:15:12.060 align:start position:0%
works
 
04:15:14.510 --> 04:15:14.520 align:start position:0%
and for in high school we're not
 
04:15:16.189 --> 04:15:16.199 align:start position:0%
required to provide transportation
 
04:15:18.590 --> 04:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
that's in our statutory law
 
04:15:20.510 --> 04:15:20.520 align:start position:0%
so if the parent is driving over to
 
04:15:22.969 --> 04:15:22.979 align:start position:0%
Franconia to go to profile why not take
 
04:15:24.469 --> 04:15:24.479 align:start position:0%
your child with you
 
04:15:25.790 --> 04:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
if you're willing to pay the difference
 
04:15:27.590 --> 04:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
fortunately in land app they pay that
 
04:15:29.229 --> 04:15:29.239 align:start position:0%
difference which is a slight difference
 
04:15:31.490 --> 04:15:31.500 align:start position:0%
now the other community which I'm
 
04:15:34.189 --> 04:15:34.199 align:start position:0%
talking about is Piermont to myself they
 
04:15:36.769 --> 04:15:36.779 align:start position:0%
have tuition agreements with five
 
04:15:39.769 --> 04:15:39.779 align:start position:0%
schools St Johnsbury Academy which is
 
04:15:42.050 --> 04:15:42.060 align:start position:0%
like a Pinkerton same quality of
 
04:15:44.269 --> 04:15:44.279 align:start position:0%
Education excellent quality education as
 
04:15:46.309 --> 04:15:46.319 align:start position:0%
we have most of our Public Schools but
 
04:15:48.170 --> 04:15:48.180 align:start position:0%
these are Independent Schools Pinkerton
 
04:15:51.530 --> 04:15:51.540 align:start position:0%
and ncj then we also have agreements
 
04:15:53.929 --> 04:15:53.939 align:start position:0%
over there with Bradford Vermont which
 
04:15:56.630 --> 04:15:56.640 align:start position:0%
is Oxbow High School which also has the
 
04:15:59.330 --> 04:15:59.340 align:start position:0%
CTE Center for all that that side of the
 
04:16:01.429 --> 04:16:01.439 align:start position:0%
river and our side of the river
 
04:16:03.769 --> 04:16:03.779 align:start position:0%
then we have Rivendell which is part of
 
04:16:06.830 --> 04:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
Orford and fairly Vermont so it's an
 
04:16:09.710 --> 04:16:09.720 align:start position:0%
interstate School District we also have
 
04:16:12.710 --> 04:16:12.720 align:start position:0%
Thetford Academy which is in Vermont and
 
04:16:15.170 --> 04:16:15.180 align:start position:0%
Woodsville High School which is in
 
04:16:17.689 --> 04:16:17.699 align:start position:0%
Haverhill where I live those are all
 
04:16:20.210 --> 04:16:20.220 align:start position:0%
under tuition agreements that they have
 
04:16:22.010 --> 04:16:22.020 align:start position:0%
signed in Paramount for their students
 
04:16:24.590 --> 04:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
have the option to go where they want to
 
04:16:27.950 --> 04:16:27.960 align:start position:0%
go now they can't go to just any school
 
04:16:31.070 --> 04:16:31.080 align:start position:0%
it has to be a school approved by the
 
04:16:33.650 --> 04:16:33.660 align:start position:0%
sending School District
 
04:16:37.189 --> 04:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
and all those schools I just spoke of re
 
04:16:38.889 --> 04:16:38.899 align:start position:0%
provide the services
 
04:16:42.110 --> 04:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
that are required in any of our Public
 
04:16:45.530 --> 04:16:45.540 align:start position:0%
Schools so there's no discrimination
 
04:16:48.229 --> 04:16:48.239 align:start position:0%
the issue that occurred in Piermont was
 
04:16:50.450 --> 04:16:50.460 align:start position:0%
that there were four students that were
 
04:16:52.309 --> 04:16:52.319 align:start position:0%
thinking about going up to St Johnsbury
 
04:16:54.349 --> 04:16:54.359 align:start position:0%
Academy they go there because of the
 
04:16:56.090 --> 04:16:56.100 align:start position:0%
science program they go across the
 
04:16:57.530 --> 04:16:57.540 align:start position:0%
Bradford because a wonderful theater
 
04:16:59.570 --> 04:16:59.580 align:start position:0%
program they go up to Haverhill or
 
04:17:01.309 --> 04:17:01.319 align:start position:0%
Woodsville because we always win the
 
04:17:03.830 --> 04:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
soccer championship and
 
04:17:06.950 --> 04:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
for those that are in division four and
 
04:17:08.689 --> 04:17:08.699 align:start position:0%
they go down to Rivendell because they
 
04:17:10.729 --> 04:17:10.739 align:start position:0%
also win all the basketball stuff or
 
04:17:12.530 --> 04:17:12.540 align:start position:0%
they have a wonderful math program down
 
04:17:12.540 --> 04:17:13.550 align:start position:0%
they have a wonderful math program down
there

04:17:13.550 --> 04:17:13.560 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:17:16.010 --> 04:17:16.020 align:start position:0%
there's reasons why parents to go in
 
04:17:18.590 --> 04:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
certain directions but what we had is of
 
04:17:20.450 --> 04:17:20.460 align:start position:0%
those four students that opted to go
 
04:17:23.510 --> 04:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to go to Saint J1 during covid
 
04:17:26.929 --> 04:17:26.939 align:start position:0%
opted to go across the river to Bradford
 
04:17:28.550 --> 04:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
and didn't have an opportunity to walk
 
04:17:30.590 --> 04:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
in the school and see it was all done
 
04:17:33.170 --> 04:17:33.180 align:start position:0%
back then on the web you did this visual
 
04:17:35.030 --> 04:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
tour and they said oh that's a wonderful
 
04:17:37.490 --> 04:17:37.500 align:start position:0%
place I'll go there the others went to
 
04:17:39.349 --> 04:17:39.359 align:start position:0%
Saint Jay because their siblings had
 
04:17:41.689 --> 04:17:41.699 align:start position:0%
gone there the cost for going to St
 
04:17:43.969 --> 04:17:43.979 align:start position:0%
Johnsbury Academy was right around the
 
04:17:47.210 --> 04:17:47.220 align:start position:0%
cap which they had for for Piermont they
 
04:17:49.670 --> 04:17:49.680 align:start position:0%
make this cap based upon taking the cost
 
04:17:51.410 --> 04:17:51.420 align:start position:0%
of Woodsville High School
 
04:17:54.349 --> 04:17:54.359 align:start position:0%
Rivendell and Bradford averaging those
 
04:17:56.990 --> 04:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
costs and then adding an 18 percent in
 
04:18:00.050 --> 04:18:00.060 align:start position:0%
top it comes up just shallow of twenty
 
04:18:01.910 --> 04:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars around nineteen
 
04:18:04.130 --> 04:18:04.140 align:start position:0%
thousand seven hundred dollars
 
04:18:06.769 --> 04:18:06.779 align:start position:0%
so that one child who went to
 
04:18:09.889 --> 04:18:09.899 align:start position:0%
um Bradford after one year said this is
 
04:18:11.750 --> 04:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
not where I want to go I want to go with
 
04:18:13.490 --> 04:18:13.500 align:start position:0%
my other three friends who went to Saint
 
04:18:17.090 --> 04:18:17.100 align:start position:0%
J in the interim Saint Jay added some
 
04:18:20.210 --> 04:18:20.220 align:start position:0%
cost to their their cap or their tuition
 
04:18:22.610 --> 04:18:22.620 align:start position:0%
rate to twenty thousand eight hundred
 
04:18:22.620 --> 04:18:23.689 align:start position:0%
rate to twenty thousand eight hundred
dollars

04:18:23.689 --> 04:18:23.699 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:18:26.750 --> 04:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
a few dollars over the cap for that town
 
04:18:28.670 --> 04:18:28.680 align:start position:0%
so the town says no you can't go to your
 
04:18:30.469 --> 04:18:30.479 align:start position:0%
above or cap parent says can I pay the
 
04:18:33.050 --> 04:18:33.060 align:start position:0%
difference in many towns throughout the
 
04:18:34.849 --> 04:18:34.859 align:start position:0%
state that's permissible because we have
 
04:18:36.950 --> 04:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
nothing on the books saying you can or
 
04:18:39.590 --> 04:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
you can't a parent pay the difference
 
04:18:41.809 --> 04:18:41.819 align:start position:0%
as this legislation is being brought to
 
04:18:44.809 --> 04:18:44.819 align:start position:0%
you it allows the school board they must
 
04:18:48.050 --> 04:18:48.060 align:start position:0%
approve the sending school they can make
 
04:18:50.990 --> 04:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
the decision also if they're going to
 
04:18:52.550 --> 04:18:52.560 align:start position:0%
allow that parent to pay the difference
 
04:18:55.189 --> 04:18:55.199 align:start position:0%
or or they will pay the difference that
 
04:18:57.349 --> 04:18:57.359 align:start position:0%
option is in in the bill
 
04:18:59.809 --> 04:18:59.819 align:start position:0%
so what we're trying to do is provide
 
04:19:02.210 --> 04:19:02.220 align:start position:0%
the option for the parent to make a
 
04:19:05.150 --> 04:19:05.160 align:start position:0%
choice based upon approved schools in
 
04:19:07.550 --> 04:19:07.560 align:start position:0%
that local sending district and a proven
 
04:19:09.950 --> 04:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
based upon the needs of that particular
 
04:19:12.410 --> 04:19:12.420 align:start position:0%
child this has been going on for years
 
04:19:14.269 --> 04:19:14.279 align:start position:0%
throughout the state we're just trying
 
04:19:16.729 --> 04:19:16.739 align:start position:0%
to get some clarifying language into
 
04:19:21.110 --> 04:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:23.330 --> 04:19:23.340 align:start position:0%
the question is on the motion of octopus
 
04:19:24.590 --> 04:19:24.600 align:start position:0%
with Amendment
 
04:19:26.389 --> 04:19:26.399 align:start position:0%
are you ready for the question
 
04:19:28.070 --> 04:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
this will be a division vote members
 
04:20:06.229 --> 04:20:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:06.239 --> 04:20:23.630 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:20:23.630 --> 04:20:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:25.370 --> 04:20:25.380 align:start position:0%
the question is on the motion about to
 
04:20:28.429 --> 04:20:28.439 align:start position:0%
pass as amended on House Bill 275 this
 
04:20:30.469 --> 04:20:30.479 align:start position:0%
is a division vote
 
04:20:32.570 --> 04:20:32.580 align:start position:0%
representative Bell Boney is recognized
 
04:20:41.389 --> 04:20:41.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:44.090 --> 04:20:44.100 align:start position:0%
no that this bill clearly benefits
 
04:20:46.610 --> 04:20:46.620 align:start position:0%
wealthier families who can afford to pay
 
04:20:49.729 --> 04:20:49.739 align:start position:0%
the cost over the tuition cap and harms
 
04:20:52.189 --> 04:20:52.199 align:start position:0%
families who did not have the means to
 
04:20:53.330 --> 04:20:53.340 align:start position:0%
do so
 
04:20:56.150 --> 04:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
and I know that this bill will allow
 
04:20:59.689 --> 04:20:59.699 align:start position:0%
school boards to lowball the costs for
 
04:21:03.889 --> 04:21:03.899 align:start position:0%
school tuition or a pod pretending to be
 
04:21:05.330 --> 04:21:05.340 align:start position:0%
a school
 
04:21:08.090 --> 04:21:08.100 align:start position:0%
and I know that this would lead parents
 
04:21:10.490 --> 04:21:10.500 align:start position:0%
with no option other than to pay out of
 
04:21:13.370 --> 04:21:13.380 align:start position:0%
pocket for tuition to a good school
 
04:21:16.790 --> 04:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
then would I now press the red button to
 
04:21:18.950 --> 04:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
provide more equity for lower income
 
04:21:18.960 --> 04:21:21.950 align:start position:0%
provide more equity for lower income
families

04:21:21.950 --> 04:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:23.929 --> 04:21:23.939 align:start position:0%
representative Ladd is recognized for
 
04:21:29.689 --> 04:21:29.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:32.090 --> 04:21:32.100 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr Speaker
 
04:21:34.429 --> 04:21:34.439 align:start position:0%
if I know that sending school districts
 
04:21:36.889 --> 04:21:36.899 align:start position:0%
throughout New Hampshire tuition their
 
04:21:39.830 --> 04:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
students to board approved receiving
 
04:21:42.110 --> 04:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
schools and districts as part of the
 
04:21:44.870 --> 04:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
state school tuition program and if I
 
04:21:46.849 --> 04:21:46.859 align:start position:0%
know this bill clarifies that a parent
 
04:21:49.790 --> 04:21:49.800 align:start position:0%
who wants to send his or her child to an
 
04:21:52.130 --> 04:21:52.140 align:start position:0%
approved school where tuition May extend
 
04:21:54.590 --> 04:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
beyond the cap that the parent May pay
 
04:21:57.469 --> 04:21:57.479 align:start position:0%
the difference as long as at least one
 
04:22:00.050 --> 04:22:00.060 align:start position:0%
other tuition option does not require
 
04:22:02.269 --> 04:22:02.279 align:start position:0%
additional tuition payment from the
 
04:22:05.809 --> 04:22:05.819 align:start position:0%
pyramid parent and if I know that with
 
04:22:08.090 --> 04:22:08.100 align:start position:0%
this legislation all children in
 
04:22:10.130 --> 04:22:10.140 align:start position:0%
ascending district will continue to
 
04:22:11.929 --> 04:22:11.939 align:start position:0%
receive the opportunity for an adequate
 
04:22:15.349 --> 04:22:15.359 align:start position:0%
education as prescribed by law and
 
04:22:17.450 --> 04:22:17.460 align:start position:0%
lastly if I know this legislation change
 
04:22:20.150 --> 04:22:20.160 align:start position:0%
will better support parents in making
 
04:22:22.429 --> 04:22:22.439 align:start position:0%
the appropriate choice for their
 
04:22:24.410 --> 04:22:24.420 align:start position:0%
children would I then press the green
 
04:22:26.990 --> 04:22:27.000 align:start position:0%

desires of their taxpayers and if I know
 
04:42:02.448 --> 04:42:02.458 align:start position:0%
the EFA program is wildly successful and
 
04:42:04.670 --> 04:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
popular and if I know that the bulk of
 
04:42:06.948 --> 04:42:06.958 align:start position:0%
local property taxes are dedicated to
 
04:42:09.350 --> 04:42:09.360 align:start position:0%

important function and just tabling it
 
04:46:05.270 --> 04:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
will will limit that debate
 
04:46:06.830 --> 04:46:06.840 align:start position:0%
if I know that there's at least two

04:49:46.730 --> 04:49:46.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
04:49:52.670 --> 04:49:52.680 align:start position:0%
I rise today to speak against HB 572 for
 
04:49:54.610 --> 04:49:54.620 align:start position:0%
a few simple reasons we've heard
 
04:49:57.470 --> 04:49:57.480 align:start position:0%
recently that some of these bills came
 
04:50:00.050 --> 04:50:00.060 align:start position:0%
to us with a fiscal note with no fiscal
 
04:50:03.770 --> 04:50:03.780 align:start position:0%
note this was one of those bills however
 
04:50:06.470 --> 04:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
I ran some numbers myself
 
04:50:09.050 --> 04:50:09.060 align:start position:0%
and I ran them multiple times just to
 
04:50:11.510 --> 04:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
get a baseline idea of where we were
 
04:50:13.788 --> 04:50:13.798 align:start position:0%
going to be at
 
04:50:17.030 --> 04:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
and let me tell you it goes very high so
 
04:50:19.310 --> 04:50:19.320 align:start position:0%
what this bill actually does is it
 
04:50:21.470 --> 04:50:21.480 align:start position:0%
increases the
 
04:50:24.650 --> 04:50:24.660 align:start position:0%
ability of students to get a free lunch
 
04:50:27.470 --> 04:50:27.480 align:start position:0%
in schools from the current federally
 
04:50:30.770 --> 04:50:30.780 align:start position:0%
mandated 185 percent of poverty level to
 
04:50:33.410 --> 04:50:33.420 align:start position:0%
300 percent of poverty level the thing
 
04:50:34.970 --> 04:50:34.980 align:start position:0%
is the federal government will not
 
04:50:38.868 --> 04:50:38.878 align:start position:0%
reimburse for anything over 185 percent
 
04:50:42.470 --> 04:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
that puts that rest of that money on the
 
04:50:44.750 --> 04:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire taxpayers
 
04:50:47.510 --> 04:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
now when you increase that to 300
 
04:50:50.448 --> 04:50:50.458 align:start position:0%
percent you're increasing it well above
 
04:50:52.670 --> 04:50:52.680 align:start position:0%
the median household income in this
 
04:50:52.680 --> 04:50:53.628 align:start position:0%
the median household income in this
state

04:50:53.628 --> 04:50:53.638 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:50:56.030 --> 04:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
it's reasonable to think at that point
 
04:50:58.250 --> 04:50:58.260 align:start position:0%
you're going to be encompassing the vast
 
04:51:00.948 --> 04:51:00.958 align:start position:0%
majority of students in our Public
 
04:51:00.958 --> 04:51:02.570 align:start position:0%
majority of students in our Public
Schools

04:51:02.570 --> 04:51:02.580 align:start position:0%
Schools
 
04:51:06.230 --> 04:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
if a large number of those students
 
04:51:08.990 --> 04:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps seventy thousand out of the
 
04:51:11.150 --> 04:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
potential ninety thousand were to sign
 
04:51:13.190 --> 04:51:13.200 align:start position:0%
up for this program
 
04:51:16.430 --> 04:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
we could easily be looking at a nine
 
04:51:18.530 --> 04:51:18.540 align:start position:0%
figure bill
 
04:51:21.110 --> 04:51:21.120 align:start position:0%
nine figures 100 million dollars
 
04:51:24.770 --> 04:51:24.780 align:start position:0%
annually it's a New Hampshire taxpayers
 
04:51:27.948 --> 04:51:27.958 align:start position:0%
that is a reasonable assumption given
 
04:51:31.788 --> 04:51:31.798 align:start position:0%
all of the data that we know from this
 
04:51:33.770 --> 04:51:33.780 align:start position:0%
on top of that
 
04:51:37.430 --> 04:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
this gets worse not only does the New
 
04:51:40.368 --> 04:51:40.378 align:start position:0%
Hampshire taxpayer foot the bill
 
04:51:43.010 --> 04:51:43.020 align:start position:0%
but this remains a federally regulated
 
04:51:46.628 --> 04:51:46.638 align:start position:0%
program because we remain in the USDA
 
04:51:49.788 --> 04:51:49.798 align:start position:0%
free and reduced lunch program which
 
04:51:51.890 --> 04:51:51.900 align:start position:0%
means all this money most of which at
 
04:51:53.330 --> 04:51:53.340 align:start position:0%
this point will be coming from New
 
04:51:55.010 --> 04:51:55.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire taxpayers
 
04:51:56.810 --> 04:51:56.820 align:start position:0%
it's still going to be regulated by the
 
04:51:58.550 --> 04:51:58.560 align:start position:0%
federal government they will determine
 
04:52:00.470 --> 04:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
the nutritional standards they will
 
04:52:02.750 --> 04:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
determine any curriculum standards that
 
04:52:04.448 --> 04:52:04.458 align:start position:0%
need to come along with federal dollars
 
04:52:07.430 --> 04:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
this is the worst of Both Worlds
 
04:52:09.770 --> 04:52:09.780 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:52:19.010 --> 04:52:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:21.170 --> 04:52:21.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
04:52:24.708 --> 04:52:24.718 align:start position:0%
today I rise in support of HB 572 as
 
04:52:24.718 --> 04:52:25.910 align:start position:0%
today I rise in support of HB 572 as
amended

04:52:25.910 --> 04:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
amended
 
04:52:28.010 --> 04:52:28.020 align:start position:0%
this bill which came out of committee
 
04:52:30.890 --> 04:52:30.900 align:start position:0%
with bipartisan support is a product of
 
04:52:33.230 --> 04:52:33.240 align:start position:0%
extensive interim study work that
 
04:52:35.990 --> 04:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
involved many Community stakeholders
 
04:52:38.810 --> 04:52:38.820 align:start position:0%
the intent of this bill is twofold
 
04:52:41.510 --> 04:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
to help support a wider range of low to
 
04:52:43.850 --> 04:52:43.860 align:start position:0%
Middle income families by raising the
 
04:52:46.490 --> 04:52:46.500 align:start position:0%
eligibility cap for free School meals to
 
04:52:49.070 --> 04:52:49.080 align:start position:0%
300 percent of the poverty level
 
04:52:51.410 --> 04:52:51.420 align:start position:0%
and two to fund the cost of providing
 
04:52:53.390 --> 04:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
these free School meals through the
 
04:52:55.628 --> 04:52:55.638 align:start position:0%
existing Federal reimbursement program
 
04:52:57.890 --> 04:52:57.900 align:start position:0%
combined with a newly considered
 
04:53:01.430 --> 04:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
supplemental State reimbursement program
 
04:53:04.368 --> 04:53:04.378 align:start position:0%
kids access to school meals has been
 
04:53:06.650 --> 04:53:06.660 align:start position:0%
curtailed at a time when many families
 
04:53:09.170 --> 04:53:09.180 align:start position:0%
continue to struggle with a rising cost
 
04:53:11.390 --> 04:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
of putting food on the table
 
04:53:14.690 --> 04:53:14.700 align:start position:0%
HP 572 as amended ensures that our most
 
04:53:16.550 --> 04:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
vulnerable Children and adolescents
 
04:53:19.610 --> 04:53:19.620 align:start position:0%
receive at least one and when possible
 
04:53:22.490 --> 04:53:22.500 align:start position:0%
two nutritious meals per day
 
04:53:26.510 --> 04:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
when someone says to you oh I'm starving
 
04:53:28.310 --> 04:53:28.320 align:start position:0%
have you ever thought to yourself no
 
04:53:30.770 --> 04:53:30.780 align:start position:0%
you're not you're just hungry
 
04:53:30.780 --> 04:53:32.030 align:start position:0%
you're not you're just hungry
hunger

04:53:32.030 --> 04:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
hunger
 
04:53:34.190 --> 04:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill is about
 
04:53:36.110 --> 04:53:36.120 align:start position:0%
childhood hunger
 
04:53:38.330 --> 04:53:38.340 align:start position:0%
no child should go hungry because of
 
04:53:40.970 --> 04:53:40.980 align:start position:0%
circumstances beyond their control
 
04:53:43.010 --> 04:53:43.020 align:start position:0%
imagine yourself in a situation where
 
04:53:44.628 --> 04:53:44.638 align:start position:0%
you're being asked to learn a new skill
 
04:53:46.970 --> 04:53:46.980 align:start position:0%
maybe one that will affect your ability
 
04:53:48.410 --> 04:53:48.420 align:start position:0%
to do your job
 
04:53:50.090 --> 04:53:50.100 align:start position:0%
but all you can think about is the fact
 
04:53:51.350 --> 04:53:51.360 align:start position:0%
that you're hungry
 
04:53:53.990 --> 04:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
now imagine that some child's reality is
 
04:53:56.750 --> 04:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
their next meal might be a day away
 
04:53:58.730 --> 04:53:58.740 align:start position:0%
we're asking kids to be their best
 
04:54:01.610 --> 04:54:01.620 align:start position:0%
selves under the worst of circumstances
 
04:54:03.530 --> 04:54:03.540 align:start position:0%
we can do better than this
 
04:54:06.410 --> 04:54:06.420 align:start position:0%
we must do better than this now
 
04:54:08.570 --> 04:54:08.580 align:start position:0%
the importance of food in a child's
 
04:54:10.430 --> 04:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
education is obvious
 
04:54:13.250 --> 04:54:13.260 align:start position:0%
School meals play a critical role in a
 
04:54:15.890 --> 04:54:15.900 align:start position:0%
student's attendance well-being and
 
04:54:17.628 --> 04:54:17.638 align:start position:0%
academic success
 
04:54:19.610 --> 04:54:19.620 align:start position:0%
a healthy diet can give a child the
 
04:54:22.490 --> 04:54:22.500 align:start position:0%
energy to think work and play
 
04:54:25.368 --> 04:54:25.378 align:start position:0%
we heard an administrator testify that
 
04:54:27.170 --> 04:54:27.180 align:start position:0%
the toughest part of his job as a school
 
04:54:29.270 --> 04:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
superintendent was having to make the
 
04:54:31.010 --> 04:54:31.020 align:start position:0%
decision to cancel school
 
04:54:32.930 --> 04:54:32.940 align:start position:0%
knowing that some kids would not get a
 
04:54:34.368 --> 04:54:34.378 align:start position:0%
meal that day
 
04:54:37.010 --> 04:54:37.020 align:start position:0%
HB 572 does not attempt to feed every
 
04:54:39.530 --> 04:54:39.540 align:start position:0%
child only those whose families who meet
 
04:54:41.810 --> 04:54:41.820 align:start position:0%
the income eligibility guidelines
 
04:54:43.670 --> 04:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
at a time when considerable attention
 
04:54:45.350 --> 04:54:45.360 align:start position:0%
has been given to the state's Surplus
 
04:54:47.448 --> 04:54:47.458 align:start position:0%
Revenue shouldn't we consider what we
 
04:54:50.150 --> 04:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
need in addition to what we want
 
04:54:53.150 --> 04:54:53.160 align:start position:0%
what we need is to end childhood hunger
 
04:54:55.190 --> 04:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and this bill is a
 
04:54:56.750 --> 04:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable start
 
04:54:58.490 --> 04:54:58.500 align:start position:0%
taxpayers provide students with
 
04:55:01.970 --> 04:55:01.980 align:start position:0%
computers textbooks and internet access
 
04:55:04.550 --> 04:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
let's do our part to ensure that our
 
04:55:06.050 --> 04:55:06.060 align:start position:0%
kids have something in their bellies
 
04:55:08.510 --> 04:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
when using these tools at least during
 
04:55:10.128 --> 04:55:10.138 align:start position:0%
the school day
 
04:55:12.110 --> 04:55:12.120 align:start position:0%
the majority of house education is
 
04:55:13.670 --> 04:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
committed to assisting Granite State
 
04:55:16.850 --> 04:55:16.860 align:start position:0%
families in reducing food insecurity and
 
04:55:18.770 --> 04:55:18.780 align:start position:0%
expanding the opportunity to feed those
 
04:55:20.208 --> 04:55:20.218 align:start position:0%
who need it most
 
04:55:22.550 --> 04:55:22.560 align:start position:0%
please join me in voting ought to pass
 
04:55:26.090 --> 04:55:26.100 align:start position:0%
on this amendment on age House Bill 572.
 
04:55:28.310 --> 04:55:28.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker I recognize
 
04:55:36.410 --> 04:55:36.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:36.420 --> 04:55:37.910 align:start position:0%
 
speaker

04:55:37.910 --> 04:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
04:55:40.550 --> 04:55:40.560 align:start position:0%
colleagues I rise today to support house
 
04:55:42.350 --> 04:55:42.360 align:start position:0%
bill 572.
 
04:55:45.230 --> 04:55:45.240 align:start position:0%
my career and expertise as a dietitian
 
04:55:47.810 --> 04:55:47.820 align:start position:0%
makes it so clear that feeding children
 
04:55:50.750 --> 04:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
is essential to their ability to learn
 
04:55:52.430 --> 04:55:52.440 align:start position:0%
and succeed
 
04:55:55.310 --> 04:55:55.320 align:start position:0%
food insecurity distracts from any other
 
04:55:57.708 --> 04:55:57.718 align:start position:0%
focus a person might have
 
04:56:00.890 --> 04:56:00.900 align:start position:0%
after breathing being adequately fed is
 
04:56:02.628 --> 04:56:02.638 align:start position:0%
the most essential component of
 
04:56:02.638 --> 04:56:03.948 align:start position:0%
the most essential component of
well-being

04:56:03.948 --> 04:56:03.958 align:start position:0%
well-being
 
04:56:06.410 --> 04:56:06.420 align:start position:0%
we might like to believe that hunger is
 
04:56:08.868 --> 04:56:08.878 align:start position:0%
not a New Hampshire issue but we would
 
04:56:11.090 --> 04:56:11.100 align:start position:0%
be profoundly wrong
 
04:56:14.448 --> 04:56:14.458 align:start position:0%
hungry children are cognitively impaired
 
04:56:17.390 --> 04:56:17.400 align:start position:0%
they cannot learn efficiently
 
04:56:19.490 --> 04:56:19.500 align:start position:0%
hungry children have less mood
 
04:56:21.948 --> 04:56:21.958 align:start position:0%
regulation and less control of their
 
04:56:21.958 --> 04:56:23.448 align:start position:0%
regulation and less control of their
behaviors

04:56:23.448 --> 04:56:23.458 align:start position:0%
behaviors
 
04:56:27.350 --> 04:56:27.360 align:start position:0%
HB 572 presents a thoroughly researched
 
04:56:29.990 --> 04:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
carefully developed approach to reducing
 
04:56:32.750 --> 04:56:32.760 align:start position:0%
childhood hunger that is very cost
 
04:56:32.760 --> 04:56:33.948 align:start position:0%
childhood hunger that is very cost
effective

04:56:33.948 --> 04:56:33.958 align:start position:0%
effective
 
04:56:36.708 --> 04:56:36.718 align:start position:0%
regardless of the reasons a family is
 
04:56:38.570 --> 04:56:38.580 align:start position:0%
not providing adequate nutrition for
 
04:56:41.330 --> 04:56:41.340 align:start position:0%
their child that child should never be
 
04:56:43.010 --> 04:56:43.020 align:start position:0%
left hungry
 
04:56:45.410 --> 04:56:45.420 align:start position:0%
Federal School Meal programs are not
 
04:56:45.420 --> 04:56:46.730 align:start position:0%
Federal School Meal programs are not
perfect

04:56:46.730 --> 04:56:46.740 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
04:56:49.310 --> 04:56:49.320 align:start position:0%
but they are much more adequate than
 
04:56:51.890 --> 04:56:51.900 align:start position:0%
they are usually perceived as and they
 
04:56:54.230 --> 04:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
have improved greatly in the last 10
 
04:56:54.240 --> 04:56:56.690 align:start position:0%
have improved greatly in the last 10
years

04:56:56.690 --> 04:56:56.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:59.510 --> 04:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
they provide far better nutrition than
 
04:57:01.670 --> 04:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
what hungry children experience without
 
04:57:03.590 --> 04:57:03.600 align:start position:0%
School meals
 
04:57:06.830 --> 04:57:06.840 align:start position:0%
he's joined me in supporting HB 572 to
 
04:57:09.410 --> 04:57:09.420 align:start position:0%
feed our children no child should ever
 
04:57:12.230 --> 04:57:12.240 align:start position:0%
be left hungry
 
04:57:13.910 --> 04:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the majority
 
04:57:16.070 --> 04:57:16.080 align:start position:0%

04:57:39.180 --> 04:58:21.650 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:58:21.650 --> 04:58:21.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:23.570 --> 04:58:23.580 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is out of the
 
04:58:24.948 --> 04:58:24.958 align:start position:0%

04:58:30.170 --> 04:58:30.180 align:start position:0%

I'd like to request a roll call Mr
 
04:58:31.740 --> 04:58:34.190 align:start position:0%
I'd like to request a roll call Mr

04:58:34.190 --> 04:58:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:36.530 --> 04:58:36.540 align:start position:0%
this is a division vote
 
04:58:38.390 --> 04:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
chair recognized representative Ladd for
 
04:58:46.128 --> 04:58:46.138 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:48.830 --> 04:58:48.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker if I know this bill
 
04:58:50.868 --> 04:58:50.878 align:start position:0%
requires each School Board
 
04:58:53.590 --> 04:58:53.600 align:start position:0%
to make at least one real meal available
 
04:58:56.448 --> 04:58:56.458 align:start position:0%
without cost to a child that qualifies
 
04:58:59.150 --> 04:58:59.160 align:start position:0%
based upon a household income less than
 
04:59:02.270 --> 04:59:02.280 align:start position:0%
or equal to 300 percent of the federal
 
04:59:05.510 --> 04:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
poverty guidelines and if I know the
 
04:59:07.128 --> 04:59:07.138 align:start position:0%
department States this bill would
 
04:59:09.890 --> 04:59:09.900 align:start position:0%
increase costs at the local level for
 
04:59:11.690 --> 04:59:11.700 align:start position:0%
providing an increased number of meals
 
04:59:14.750 --> 04:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
at no cost and at the state level for

Staffing and the administration of the
 
04:59:19.730 --> 04:59:19.740 align:start position:0%
new program if I also know the bill
 
04:59:22.910 --> 04:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
creates a need for a new uh form of
 
04:59:26.270 --> 04:59:26.280 align:start position:0%
determining eligibility as the current
 
04:59:29.868 --> 04:59:29.878 align:start position:0%
process is under USDA would I then press
 
04:59:31.730 --> 04:59:31.740 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker if I know that many
 
04:59:44.868 --> 04:59:44.878 align:start position:0%
children in our schools are going
 
04:59:46.610 --> 04:59:46.620 align:start position:0%
through the school day without either
 
04:59:49.128 --> 04:59:49.138 align:start position:0%
breakfast or lunch because their parents
 
04:59:51.230 --> 04:59:51.240 align:start position:0%
cannot afford these meals
 
04:59:53.750 --> 04:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
and Mr Speaker if I believe that as a
 
04:59:55.310 --> 04:59:55.320 align:start position:0%
state representative I have the

offered in committee and failed in the
 
05:15:29.690 --> 05:15:29.700 align:start position:0%
Thai vote
 
05:15:32.628 --> 05:15:32.638 align:start position:0%

this amendment are unclear to the
 
05:15:36.890 --> 05:15:36.900 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services and

favorable than longer ones Mr Speaker
 
05:15:46.970 --> 05:15:46.980 align:start position:0%
would I then press the red button to
 
05:15:49.070 --> 05:15:49.080 align:start position:0%

waters to be protected
 
05:16:15.650 --> 05:16:15.660 align:start position:0%
and if I know that permeation of soils
 
05:16:17.270 --> 05:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
with pollutants and leachate can
 
05:16:19.430 --> 05:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
eventually reach our Vital drinking and
 
05:16:19.440 --> 05:16:20.708 align:start position:0%

05:16:28.810 --> 05:16:28.820 align:start position:0%
of water has already occurred in places
 
05:16:32.510 --> 05:16:32.520 align:start position:0%
like East Palestine Ohio Flint Michigan
 
05:16:35.690 --> 05:16:35.700 align:start position:0%
Fort Bragg North Carolina and even in
 
05:16:37.730 --> 05:16:37.740 align:start position:0%

pfas as well as other places
 
05:16:43.730 --> 05:16:43.740 align:start position:0%
and if I know that we can measure guard
 
05:16:46.128 --> 05:16:46.138 align:start position:0%
and remedy ground contamination movement
 
05:16:49.310 --> 05:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
with this amendment and bill before it
 
05:16:51.948 --> 05:16:51.958 align:start position:0%
reaches our water resources
 
05:16:54.110 --> 05:16:54.120 align:start position:0%

good afternoon Mr Speaker
 
05:18:28.970 --> 05:18:28.980 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire does not have a landfill
 
05:18:31.788 --> 05:18:31.798 align:start position:0%
capacity problem
 
05:18:34.788 --> 05:18:34.798 align:start position:0%
it has a trash problem
 
05:18:38.868 --> 05:18:38.878 align:start position:0%
it has a very big trash problem
 
05:18:42.530 --> 05:18:42.540 align:start position:0%
a part of that problem is that the state
 
05:18:44.990 --> 05:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
of Massachusetts is closing the
 
05:18:48.470 --> 05:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
availability to its landfills and so
 
05:18:51.288 --> 05:18:51.298 align:start position:0%
businesses are tracking are Trucking the
 
05:18:53.930 --> 05:18:53.940 align:start position:0%
trash up to us
 
05:18:53.940 --> 05:18:56.530 align:start position:0%
trash up to us
so

05:18:56.530 --> 05:18:56.540 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:19:01.190 --> 05:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
this bill is going to try to say where
 
05:19:05.270 --> 05:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
we are going to put the landfills
 
05:19:08.750 --> 05:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
we've had this bill for four years in my
 
05:19:13.010 --> 05:19:13.020 align:start position:0%
committee and actually we received more
 
05:19:15.650 --> 05:19:15.660 align:start position:0%
mail than I had ever received in all my
 
05:19:17.208 --> 05:19:17.218 align:start position:0%
years here
 
05:19:20.270 --> 05:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
and I I live in Nashua Southern border
 
05:19:20.280 --> 05:19:21.948 align:start position:0%
and I I live in Nashua Southern border
and

05:19:21.948 --> 05:19:21.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:19:25.368 --> 05:19:25.378 align:start position:0%
I drove up there to
 
05:19:25.378 --> 05:19:25.970 align:start position:0%
I drove up there to
um

05:19:25.970 --> 05:19:25.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:29.510 --> 05:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
to Bethlehem and White Field
 
05:19:32.390 --> 05:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
so I could see what was going on at
 
05:19:34.310 --> 05:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
Forest Lake
 
05:19:37.910 --> 05:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
and we had a constituent meeting in the
 
05:19:41.448 --> 05:19:41.458 align:start position:0%
middle of Frozen Forest Lake
 
05:19:45.830 --> 05:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
and what I learned
 
05:19:45.840 --> 05:19:47.570 align:start position:0%
and what I learned
is

05:19:47.570 --> 05:19:47.580 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:19:53.090 --> 05:19:53.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:55.850 --> 05:19:55.860 align:start position:0%
we're the ones who were sent here to
 
05:19:57.590 --> 05:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
take care of them
 
05:20:00.470 --> 05:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
there's very small towns
 
05:20:02.990 --> 05:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
with not a lot of money
 
05:20:05.810 --> 05:20:05.820 align:start position:0%
and a big corporation that was going to
 
05:20:08.030 --> 05:20:08.040 align:start position:0%
tell people that we need another yet
 
05:20:10.730 --> 05:20:10.740 align:start position:0%
another landfill
 
05:20:10.740 --> 05:20:11.330 align:start position:0%
another landfill
um

05:20:11.330 --> 05:20:11.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:20:14.030 --> 05:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
so that they have a place to put their
 
05:20:15.948 --> 05:20:15.958 align:start position:0%
own trash
 
05:20:19.250 --> 05:20:19.260 align:start position:0%
are you know from other states we don't
 
05:20:21.470 --> 05:20:21.480 align:start position:0%
need trash from other states to come
 
05:20:24.470 --> 05:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
here and we don't need
 
05:20:28.610 --> 05:20:28.620 align:start position:0%
to have landfills just built where we
 
05:20:31.550 --> 05:20:31.560 align:start position:0%
don't want them and so I would ask that
 
05:20:34.670 --> 05:20:34.680 align:start position:0%
you would join me and supporting all the
 
05:20:37.910 --> 05:20:37.920 align:start position:0%

05:20:58.250 --> 05:20:58.260 align:start position:0%
I rise in opposition to the
 
05:21:01.550 --> 05:21:01.560 align:start position:0%
ought to pass motion for HB 56. the
 
05:21:04.070 --> 05:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
committee agreed wholeheartedly
 
05:21:05.990 --> 05:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
with the importance of protecting our
 
05:21:08.030 --> 05:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
service and groundwater
 
05:21:12.590 --> 05:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
there have been extensive studies on how
 
05:21:14.530 --> 05:21:14.540 align:start position:0%
to clean up and make sure that the
 
05:21:17.390 --> 05:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
landfills are safe however
 
05:21:19.128 --> 05:21:19.138 align:start position:0%
during testimony Department of
 
05:21:21.350 --> 05:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
Environmental Service was adamant
 
05:21:25.310 --> 05:21:25.320 align:start position:0%
the hb66 would tie their hands with
 
05:21:27.350 --> 05:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
regard to developing the effective
 
05:21:30.190 --> 05:21:30.200 align:start position:0%
systems needed to properly monitor
 
05:21:32.390 --> 05:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
landfills and protect our ground and
 
05:21:33.708 --> 05:21:33.718 align:start position:0%
surface water
 
05:21:37.730 --> 05:21:37.740 align:start position:0%
HB 56 applies a one-size-fits-all
 
05:21:41.330 --> 05:21:41.340 align:start position:0%
solution to a complex problem that
 
05:21:43.910 --> 05:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
varies from site to site
 
05:21:45.708 --> 05:21:45.718 align:start position:0%
according to testimony New Hampshire
 
05:21:45.718 --> 05:21:47.090 align:start position:0%
according to testimony New Hampshire
landfills

05:21:47.090 --> 05:21:47.100 align:start position:0%
landfills
 
05:21:49.310 --> 05:21:49.320 align:start position:0%
are currently safe
 
05:21:52.610 --> 05:21:52.620 align:start position:0%
there are no landfills currently in the
 
05:21:55.310 --> 05:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
pipeline for approval of this lengthy
 
05:21:55.320 --> 05:21:56.570 align:start position:0%
pipeline for approval of this lengthy
process

05:21:56.570 --> 05:21:56.580 align:start position:0%
process
 
05:21:58.310 --> 05:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
we need to protect our water from
 
05:22:00.830 --> 05:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
potential landfill contamination
 
05:22:02.930 --> 05:22:02.940 align:start position:0%
but we need to make sure that our
 
05:22:06.110 --> 05:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
actions are well coordinated and have
 
05:22:08.628 --> 05:22:08.638 align:start position:0%
the intended consequences
 
05:22:11.090 --> 05:22:11.100 align:start position:0%
we heard in testimony that something has
 
05:22:13.070 --> 05:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
to be done
 
05:22:15.708 --> 05:22:15.718 align:start position:0%
even if it's not exactly right
 
05:22:21.470 --> 05:22:21.480 align:start position:0%
HB 56 as a case of ready fire aim
 
05:22:23.390 --> 05:22:23.400 align:start position:0%
it is trying to set standards for
 
05:22:23.400 --> 05:22:25.010 align:start position:0%
it is trying to set standards for
landfills

05:22:25.010 --> 05:22:25.020 align:start position:0%
landfills
 
05:22:26.690 --> 05:22:26.700 align:start position:0%
but they will not have the desired
 
05:22:26.700 --> 05:22:27.590 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr speaker thank you members
 
05:22:46.788 --> 05:22:46.798 align:start position:0%
currently the device and Department of
 
05:22:48.708 --> 05:22:48.718 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services rules set the
 
05:22:50.448 --> 05:22:50.458 align:start position:0%
minimum distance from a landfill to a
 
05:22:53.270 --> 05:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
surface water body at 200 feet New
 
05:22:54.890 --> 05:22:54.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire landfills annually produce
 
05:22:57.050 --> 05:22:57.060 align:start position:0%
between 2 million and 50 million gallons
 
05:22:58.430 --> 05:22:58.440 align:start position:0%
of leachate
 
05:23:00.410 --> 05:23:00.420 align:start position:0%
which typically contains many toxic
 
05:23:02.930 --> 05:23:02.940 align:start position:0%
substances including pfas
 
05:23:04.730 --> 05:23:04.740 align:start position:0%
although required double whiners reduce
 
05:23:07.550 --> 05:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
the chance of a leak leak the risk of a
 
05:23:09.110 --> 05:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
leaker spill over the multi-decade
 
05:23:10.850 --> 05:23:10.860 align:start position:0%
lifetime of a landfill remains
 
05:23:10.860 --> 05:23:12.050 align:start position:0%
lifetime of a landfill remains
significant

05:23:12.050 --> 05:23:12.060 align:start position:0%
significant
 
05:23:13.850 --> 05:23:13.860 align:start position:0%
the answer is not better liner
 
05:23:16.430 --> 05:23:16.440 align:start position:0%
technology choosing the right amp
 
05:23:18.170 --> 05:23:18.180 align:start position:0%
location is the answer
 
05:23:21.110 --> 05:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
under HB 56 the minimum distance from a
 
05:23:22.910 --> 05:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
landfill to a surface water body is
 
05:23:24.650 --> 05:23:24.660 align:start position:0%
based on how far a leak would travel in
 
05:23:25.850 --> 05:23:25.860 align:start position:0%
five years
 
05:23:28.368 --> 05:23:28.378 align:start position:0%
five years provides enough time to
 
05:23:32.330 --> 05:23:32.340 align:start position:0%
detect and begin to remediate any leak
 
05:23:33.948 --> 05:23:33.958 align:start position:0%
the amendment provides a very clear
 
05:23:35.390 --> 05:23:35.400 align:start position:0%
Grandfather Clause written in
 
05:23:37.128 --> 05:23:37.138 align:start position:0%
consultation with landfill industry
 
05:23:39.708 --> 05:23:39.718 align:start position:0%
stakeholders that that says this bill
 
05:23:41.628 --> 05:23:41.638 align:start position:0%
will not limit future expense and
 
05:23:44.090 --> 05:23:44.100 align:start position:0%
expansions at any currently operating
 
05:23:46.550 --> 05:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
landfill it's also the case that all
 
05:23:48.770 --> 05:23:48.780 align:start position:0%
currently operating landfills would meet
 
05:23:50.510 --> 05:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
the sec-back requirement within this
 
05:23:50.520 --> 05:23:51.890 align:start position:0%
the sec-back requirement within this
bill

05:23:51.900 --> 05:23:52.430 align:start position:0%
bill
um

05:23:52.430 --> 05:23:52.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:54.708 --> 05:23:54.718 align:start position:0%
Des was not supportive of this bill
 
05:23:56.690 --> 05:23:56.700 align:start position:0%
claiming that all aspects of landfill
 
05:23:58.850 --> 05:23:58.860 align:start position:0%
citing belong in rules because
 
05:24:01.010 --> 05:24:01.020 align:start position:0%
everything about our Landslide landfill
 
05:24:03.530 --> 05:24:03.540 align:start position:0%
sighting is so site specific any
 
05:24:05.868 --> 05:24:05.878 align:start position:0%
limitation in statute would prevent them
 
05:24:08.570 --> 05:24:08.580 align:start position:0%
from issuing variances they seem to
 
05:24:11.090 --> 05:24:11.100 align:start position:0%
misunderstand the respective roles of
 
05:24:13.730 --> 05:24:13.740 align:start position:0%
the legislature and the Departments
 
05:24:16.730 --> 05:24:16.740 align:start position:0%
we need to be clear our job is to set
 
05:24:19.128 --> 05:24:19.138 align:start position:0%
principles theirs is to make rules
 
05:24:22.310 --> 05:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
consistent with the principles
 
05:24:25.788 --> 05:24:25.798 align:start position:0%
signing landfills where only where they
 
05:24:27.470 --> 05:24:27.480 align:start position:0%
will not harm groundwater and surface
 
05:24:30.230 --> 05:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
water is an overriding principle for our
 
05:24:33.170 --> 05:24:33.180 align:start position:0%
state's economy our tourism and our
 
05:24:33.180 --> 05:24:34.010 align:start position:0%
state's economy our tourism and our
health

05:24:34.010 --> 05:24:34.020 align:start position:0%
health
 
05:24:36.470 --> 05:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
if a potential landfill site fails this
 
05:24:37.850 --> 05:24:37.860 align:start position:0%
principle it should not get
 
05:24:37.860 --> 05:24:39.230 align:start position:0%
principle it should not get
consideration

05:24:39.230 --> 05:24:39.240 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
05:24:41.750 --> 05:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
for example a gravel pit that would put
 
05:24:43.670 --> 05:24:43.680 align:start position:0%
a potential leak within six months of
 
05:24:45.830 --> 05:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
forest lake and within 12 months of the
 
05:24:48.110 --> 05:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
amnusic river should never be considered
 
05:24:50.570 --> 05:24:50.580 align:start position:0%
as a potential landfill site yet
 
05:24:52.910 --> 05:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
following their citing current sighting
 
05:24:55.310 --> 05:24:55.320 align:start position:0%
rules Des allowed a company to spend
 
05:24:56.810 --> 05:24:56.820 align:start position:0%
several years and a lot of money
 
05:24:59.390 --> 05:24:59.400 align:start position:0%
applying for a permit for that location
 
05:25:01.610 --> 05:25:01.620 align:start position:0%
the request has been withdrawn but
 
05:25:03.650 --> 05:25:03.660 align:start position:0%
nothing in Des rules says that can't be
 
05:25:03.660 --> 05:25:04.910 align:start position:0%
nothing in Des rules says that can't be
resubmitted

05:25:04.910 --> 05:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
resubmitted
 
05:25:07.430 --> 05:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
if HB 56 had been enforced at the time
 
05:25:09.288 --> 05:25:09.298 align:start position:0%
they could have determined with a few
 
05:25:11.750 --> 05:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
tests that the site was not suitable and
 
05:25:13.788 --> 05:25:13.798 align:start position:0%
saved a lot of money and effort
 
05:25:16.070 --> 05:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
putting principles like groundwater and
 
05:25:17.890 --> 05:25:17.900 align:start position:0%
surface water protection in statute
 
05:25:20.868 --> 05:25:20.878 align:start position:0%
provides regulatory predictability that
 
05:25:24.170 --> 05:25:24.180 align:start position:0%
industry needs passing HB 56 will
 
05:25:26.150 --> 05:25:26.160 align:start position:0%
provide the house position that there
 
05:25:28.070 --> 05:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
needs to be a clear upfront indicator
 
05:25:30.708 --> 05:25:30.718 align:start position:0%
for landfill sighting and that strong
 
05:25:32.330 --> 05:25:32.340 align:start position:0%
protections for our groundwater and
 
05:25:34.368 --> 05:25:34.378 align:start position:0%
surface water bodies are critical for

05:27:03.770 --> 05:27:03.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
05:27:06.530 --> 05:27:06.540 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know according to
 
05:27:09.708 --> 05:27:09.718 align:start position:0%
testimony current operating landfills in
 
05:27:12.590 --> 05:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
Berlin in Rochester and in Bethlehem
 
05:27:15.170 --> 05:27:15.180 align:start position:0%
would have likely passed the test in the
 
05:27:17.570 --> 05:27:17.580 align:start position:0%
proposed language in this bill leading
 
05:27:19.670 --> 05:27:19.680 align:start position:0%
me to believe that current Department of
 
05:27:22.430 --> 05:27:22.440 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services rules for citing
 
05:27:25.670 --> 05:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
landfills are presently very successful
 
05:27:29.030 --> 05:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
and Mr Speaker if I know landfill citing
 
05:27:31.208 --> 05:27:31.218 align:start position:0%
criteria using
 
05:27:33.770 --> 05:27:33.780 align:start position:0%
hydrogeologic conditions should be
 
05:27:36.050 --> 05:27:36.060 align:start position:0%
studied more as to how it can be
 
05:27:38.868 --> 05:27:38.878 align:start position:0%
correctly incorporated into statute and
 
05:27:41.448 --> 05:27:41.458 align:start position:0%
lastly Mr Speaker if I know that the
 
05:27:44.030 --> 05:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
ability to Grant time to be taken off of
 
05:27:46.310 --> 05:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
the leachate travel time in site
 
05:27:49.310 --> 05:27:49.320 align:start position:0%
evaluation from five from five years to
 
05:27:51.230 --> 05:27:51.240 align:start position:0%
three years
 
05:27:53.930 --> 05:27:53.940 align:start position:0%
is vague and lacks details for the
 
05:27:55.910 --> 05:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services to
 
05:27:59.030 --> 05:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
follow then Mr Speaker would I press the
 
05:28:00.890 --> 05:28:00.900 align:start position:0%
red button so another motion can be
 
05:28:00.900 --> 05:28:02.208 align:start position:0%
red button so another motion can be
offered

05:28:02.208 --> 05:28:02.218 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker
 
05:28:11.628 --> 05:28:11.638 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that landfills are
 
05:28:13.730 --> 05:28:13.740 align:start position:0%
the natural consequence of the very high
 
05:28:17.330 --> 05:28:17.340 align:start position:0%
standard of living that we enjoy as a
 
05:28:20.690 --> 05:28:20.700 align:start position:0%
people but Mr Speaker if I know that

considered the same being unable to
 
05:30:25.788 --> 05:30:25.798 align:start position:0%
agree with the majority Report with the
 
05:30:27.050 --> 05:30:27.060 align:start position:0%
following resolution resolved as
 
05:30:29.990 --> 05:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
inexpeding to legislate J.C Grotti for
 
05:30:31.610 --> 05:30:31.620 align:start position:0%
the minority of the committee chair
 
05:30:39.410 --> 05:30:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:41.510 --> 05:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
05:30:44.930 --> 05:30:44.940 align:start position:0%
House Bill 127 just grab some profit a
 
05:30:48.350 --> 05:30:48.360 align:start position:0%
process that already exists in statute
 
05:30:51.650 --> 05:30:51.660 align:start position:0%
at the calling of the speaker the house
 
05:30:53.948 --> 05:30:53.958 align:start position:0%
will convene during a state of emergency
 
05:30:56.868 --> 05:30:56.878 align:start position:0%
and determine whether or not the state
 
05:31:01.010 --> 05:31:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:02.750 --> 05:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
and therefore
 
05:31:04.610 --> 05:31:04.620 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that we need House Bill
 
05:31:07.368 --> 05:31:07.378 align:start position:0%
127 because we could already do what
 
05:31:09.890 --> 05:31:09.900 align:start position:0%
when House Bill 127 is asking us to do
 
05:31:11.628 --> 05:31:11.638 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:31:13.128 --> 05:31:13.138 align:start position:0%
chair recognize representative Tony
 
05:31:13.138 --> 05:31:19.310 align:start position:0%
chair recognize representative Tony
Lucas

05:31:19.310 --> 05:31:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:21.830 --> 05:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
05:31:24.170 --> 05:31:24.180 align:start position:0%
while it was said about current statute
 
05:31:26.810 --> 05:31:26.820 align:start position:0%
is correct there is a extremely
 
05:31:28.368 --> 05:31:28.378 align:start position:0%
important difference
 
05:31:31.250 --> 05:31:31.260 align:start position:0%
right now if the uh
 
05:31:33.590 --> 05:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
if the legislature doesn't end up
 
05:31:36.708 --> 05:31:36.718 align:start position:0%
meeting and have a quorum
 
05:31:38.510 --> 05:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
um then the state of emergency could
 
05:31:40.010 --> 05:31:40.020 align:start position:0%
continue indefinitely without the
 
05:31:42.410 --> 05:31:42.420 align:start position:0%
legislature's involvement and also very
 
05:31:42.420 --> 05:31:43.550 align:start position:0%
legislature's involvement and also very
importantly

05:31:43.550 --> 05:31:43.560 align:start position:0%
importantly
 
05:31:45.770 --> 05:31:45.780 align:start position:0%
to end the state of emergency would take
 
05:31:47.930 --> 05:31:47.940 align:start position:0%
a majority vote of both the house and
 
05:31:49.128 --> 05:31:49.138 align:start position:0%
the Senate
 
05:31:51.470 --> 05:31:51.480 align:start position:0%
I mean for every Bill we we work on
 
05:31:53.030 --> 05:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
today and every Bill we vote on this
 
05:31:53.040 --> 05:31:53.930 align:start position:0%
today and every Bill we vote on this
session

05:31:53.930 --> 05:31:53.940 align:start position:0%
session
 
05:31:56.208 --> 05:31:56.218 align:start position:0%
to become law requires a vote of both
 
05:31:58.070 --> 05:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
the house and the Senate along with the
 
05:32:02.930 --> 05:32:02.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:04.570 --> 05:32:04.580 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:32:06.650 --> 05:32:06.660 align:start position:0%
and we're dealing with a much more
 
05:32:08.350 --> 05:32:08.360 align:start position:0%
important thing for a state of emergency
 
05:32:11.270 --> 05:32:11.280 align:start position:0%
part one article 37 of our Constitution
 
05:32:13.788 --> 05:32:13.798 align:start position:0%
states in part in the government of this
 
05:32:15.288 --> 05:32:15.298 align:start position:0%
government of this state the three
 
05:32:17.570 --> 05:32:17.580 align:start position:0%
essential Powers thereof to wit the
 
05:32:19.490 --> 05:32:19.500 align:start position:0%
legislative executive and judicial ought
 
05:32:22.010 --> 05:32:22.020 align:start position:0%
to be kept as separate from independent
 
05:32:24.590 --> 05:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
of each other as the nature of a free
 
05:32:26.750 --> 05:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
government will admit a state of
 
05:32:29.150 --> 05:32:29.160 align:start position:0%
emergency is a truly extraordinary thing
 
05:32:31.310 --> 05:32:31.320 align:start position:0%
it is the suspension of this
 
05:32:33.288 --> 05:32:33.298 align:start position:0%
constitutionally mandated separation of
 
05:32:35.810 --> 05:32:35.820 align:start position:0%
powers well that may be necessary to
 
05:32:38.090 --> 05:32:38.100 align:start position:0%
respond quickly to an emergency after
 
05:32:39.770 --> 05:32:39.780 align:start position:0%
some point in time it is no longer
 
05:32:42.170 --> 05:32:42.180 align:start position:0%
Justified and the legislature must
 
05:32:44.330 --> 05:32:44.340 align:start position:0%
resume its constitutionally mandated
 
05:32:46.910 --> 05:32:46.920 align:start position:0%
task of guiding the way any remaining
 
05:32:48.650 --> 05:32:48.660 align:start position:0%
problems created by the emergency are
 
05:32:51.470 --> 05:32:51.480 align:start position:0%
managed that must be an active role not
 
05:32:53.690 --> 05:32:53.700 align:start position:0%
just standing aside and acquiescing to
 
05:32:55.310 --> 05:32:55.320 align:start position:0%
whatever the governor chooses to do
 
05:33:00.350 --> 05:33:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:04.490 --> 05:33:04.500 align:start position:0%
the recent emergency brought this statue
 
05:33:06.230 --> 05:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
to our attention it's the first time
 
05:33:08.750 --> 05:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
that it's ever been used this bill is
 
05:33:10.550 --> 05:33:10.560 align:start position:0%
not a referendum on how the recent state
 
05:33:12.890 --> 05:33:12.900 align:start position:0%
of emergency was handled even if we
 
05:33:14.390 --> 05:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
believe that the current governor
 
05:33:16.850 --> 05:33:16.860 align:start position:0%
handled the emergency perfectly we need
 
05:33:18.470 --> 05:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
to consider the possibility that a
 
05:33:20.270 --> 05:33:20.280 align:start position:0%
future Governor May respond in a less
 
05:33:22.070 --> 05:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate manner
 
05:33:24.470 --> 05:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
also if the state of emergency does need
 
05:33:26.990 --> 05:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
to extend beyond 84 days the legislature
 
05:33:29.150 --> 05:33:29.160 align:start position:0%
should have the governor's back and
 
05:33:31.368 --> 05:33:31.378 align:start position:0%
actively declare its support of how the
 
05:33:33.830 --> 05:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
emergency is being handled if there's
 
05:33:35.628 --> 05:33:35.638 align:start position:0%
opposition to the state of emergency we
 
05:33:37.430 --> 05:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
should share in the blame or credit of
 
05:33:39.770 --> 05:33:39.780 align:start position:0%
extending it that is our responsibility
 
05:33:41.930 --> 05:33:41.940 align:start position:0%

05:33:44.030 --> 05:33:44.040 align:start position:0%

hey Mr Speaker if I know that that
 
05:35:34.788 --> 05:35:34.798 align:start position:0%
pandemic or emergency might be big
 
05:35:37.128 --> 05:35:37.138 align:start position:0%

in the time frame stated
 
05:35:43.970 --> 05:35:43.980 align:start position:0%
and Mr Speaker if I know that what we
 
05:35:45.948 --> 05:35:45.958 align:start position:0%
currently have in statute is sufficient
 
05:35:47.510 --> 05:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
in stating that
 
05:35:50.510 --> 05:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
the legislature can terminate the state
 
05:35:53.868 --> 05:35:53.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:56.330 --> 05:35:56.340 align:start position:0%

and if I know that is perfectly
 
05:36:24.110 --> 05:36:24.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate and constitutional to have a
 
05:36:26.510 --> 05:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
different method for the legislature to
 
05:36:29.570 --> 05:36:29.580 align:start position:0%

the same recommendation that the bill

ought to pass from the J.C Grotti for

thank you Mr Speaker
 
05:38:31.740 --> 05:38:33.650 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
so

05:38:33.650 --> 05:38:33.660 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:38:35.930 --> 05:38:35.940 align:start position:0%
how many of you were even aware that we
 
05:38:40.010 --> 05:38:40.020 align:start position:0%
have a commission on demographic trends
 
05:38:40.020 --> 05:38:41.810 align:start position:0%
have a commission on demographic trends
anybody

05:38:41.810 --> 05:38:41.820 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
05:38:43.850 --> 05:38:43.860 align:start position:0%
well don't feel guilty because we have
 
05:38:47.270 --> 05:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
lots and lots of committees that study
 
05:38:50.270 --> 05:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
things a regular basis and so forth and
 
05:38:54.110 --> 05:38:54.120 align:start position:0%
it's only been in effect for one year
 
05:38:55.788 --> 05:38:55.798 align:start position:0%
and already we're talking about
 
05:38:57.288 --> 05:38:57.298 align:start position:0%
repealing it
 
05:39:00.110 --> 05:39:00.120 align:start position:0%
now we have lots of devices and entities
 
05:39:02.930 --> 05:39:02.940 align:start position:0%
in our lives that we depend on to
 
05:39:05.050 --> 05:39:05.060 align:start position:0%
provide us with important information
 
05:39:07.730 --> 05:39:07.740 align:start position:0%
some of them are things like your gas
 
05:39:07.740 --> 05:39:09.530 align:start position:0%
some of them are things like your gas
gauge

05:39:09.530 --> 05:39:09.540 align:start position:0%
gauge
 
05:39:11.270 --> 05:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
how would you like to drive around with
 
05:39:14.628 --> 05:39:14.638 align:start position:0%
a car that had a defective gas gauge
 
05:39:19.190 --> 05:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
so the reality is or your smoke alarm
 
05:39:21.470 --> 05:39:21.480 align:start position:0%
that's supposed to tell you when the
 
05:39:23.470 --> 05:39:23.480 align:start position:0%
battery needs replacing
 
05:39:26.150 --> 05:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
but in this particular in this
 
05:39:27.850 --> 05:39:27.860 align:start position:0%
particular case
 
05:39:31.128 --> 05:39:31.138 align:start position:0%
the commission on demographic Trends has
 
05:39:34.850 --> 05:39:34.860 align:start position:0%
had a problem with achieving a quorum
 
05:39:36.948 --> 05:39:36.958 align:start position:0%
we kind of live in extraordinary times
 
05:39:39.170 --> 05:39:39.180 align:start position:0%
don't we where we've had to deal with
 
05:39:42.350 --> 05:39:42.360 align:start position:0%
lots of unusual situations and the
 
05:39:44.288 --> 05:39:44.298 align:start position:0%
reality is that
 
05:39:46.550 --> 05:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
demographics are not insignificant
 
05:39:49.070 --> 05:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
demographics are kind of like kind of
 
05:39:50.448 --> 05:39:50.458 align:start position:0%
like gravity
 
05:39:52.670 --> 05:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
you can deny him you can hide from them
 
05:39:55.910 --> 05:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
but you can't really Escape them and the
 
05:39:58.670 --> 05:39:58.680 align:start position:0%
reality is we that the the commission on
 
05:40:01.310 --> 05:40:01.320 align:start position:0%
demographic Trends is not supposed to
 
05:40:04.250 --> 05:40:04.260 align:start position:0%
develop all this science that's what we
 
05:40:06.830 --> 05:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
have universities like UNH which has a
 
05:40:08.050 --> 05:40:08.060 align:start position:0%
very good
 
05:40:12.590 --> 05:40:12.600 align:start position:0%
uh scientific department on demographics
 
05:40:15.230 --> 05:40:15.240 align:start position:0%
but what the what the commission is
 
05:40:16.788 --> 05:40:16.798 align:start position:0%
supposed to do is it's supposed to
 
05:40:19.910 --> 05:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
monitor what the situation is and the
 
05:40:21.650 --> 05:40:21.660 align:start position:0%
science is
 
05:40:23.770 --> 05:40:23.780 align:start position:0%
and they're supposed to act as our
 
05:40:26.510 --> 05:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
Clearinghouse our Sentry our monitor
 
05:40:29.390 --> 05:40:29.400 align:start position:0%
maybe like our gas gauge telling us we
 
05:40:31.850 --> 05:40:31.860 align:start position:0%
got a situation that we ought to be
 
05:40:33.910 --> 05:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
paying attention to because
 
05:40:37.850 --> 05:40:37.860 align:start position:0%
demographic Trends have an impact on our
 
05:40:41.208 --> 05:40:41.218 align:start position:0%
economy our health care our retirement
 
05:40:43.788 --> 05:40:43.798 align:start position:0%
system all these kinds of things and the
 
05:40:45.590 --> 05:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
fact that the commission has had some
 
05:40:47.810 --> 05:40:47.820 align:start position:0%
problems with the Quorum in year one for
 
05:40:49.670 --> 05:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
crying out loud under these
 
05:40:52.430 --> 05:40:52.440 align:start position:0%
extraordinary circumstances is no reason
 
05:40:54.230 --> 05:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
to abandon it
 
05:40:56.390 --> 05:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
before it's ever had a chance to really
 
05:40:58.250 --> 05:40:58.260 align:start position:0%
do what it's supposed to do
 
05:41:00.350 --> 05:41:00.360 align:start position:0%
so I understand you know I've been here
 
05:41:01.868 --> 05:41:01.878 align:start position:0%
for 20 years
 
05:41:06.230 --> 05:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
and so I understand that a 14 to 2 vote
 
05:41:07.788 --> 05:41:07.798 align:start position:0%
suggests that the committee thought
 
05:41:10.430 --> 05:41:10.440 align:start position:0%
differently and they did
 
05:41:12.050 --> 05:41:12.060 align:start position:0%
but frankly
 
05:41:14.628 --> 05:41:14.638 align:start position:0%
anybody's capable of making a mistake
 
05:41:16.970 --> 05:41:16.980 align:start position:0%
and in this case the committee majority
 
05:41:18.948 --> 05:41:18.958 align:start position:0%
made a mistake there's just no two ways
 
05:41:21.368 --> 05:41:21.378 align:start position:0%
about it if they'd known more about
 
05:41:24.948 --> 05:41:24.958 align:start position:0%
demography I heard a wonderful lecture
 
05:41:27.350 --> 05:41:27.360 align:start position:0%
a long time ago from one of the
 
05:41:27.360 --> 05:41:29.230 align:start position:0%
a long time ago from one of the
outstanding

05:41:29.230 --> 05:41:29.240 align:start position:0%
outstanding
 
05:41:31.510 --> 05:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
scientists in this field Peter Francis
 
05:41:33.770 --> 05:41:33.780 align:start position:0%
was now moved off to Pennsylvania
 
05:41:33.780 --> 05:41:35.288 align:start position:0%
was now moved off to Pennsylvania
unfortunately

05:41:35.288 --> 05:41:35.298 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
05:41:39.410 --> 05:41:39.420 align:start position:0%
but it was incredibly enlightening we
 
05:41:40.970 --> 05:41:40.980 align:start position:0%
should have a lecture on the subject
 
05:41:43.070 --> 05:41:43.080 align:start position:0%
ourselves sometime that we could all
 
05:41:45.470 --> 05:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
have lunch and listen to somebody that
 
05:41:47.090 --> 05:41:47.100 align:start position:0%
knows a lot about something that we
 
05:41:50.330 --> 05:41:50.340 align:start position:0%
should know more about so please don't
 
05:41:52.310 --> 05:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
throw the baby out with a bath just
 
05:41:54.410 --> 05:41:54.420 align:start position:0%
because we've under these extraordinary
 
05:41:57.230 --> 05:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
circumstances it hasn't met that's more
 
05:41:59.750 --> 05:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
of a failure or leadership than anything
 
05:41:59.760 --> 05:42:01.190 align:start position:0%
of a failure or leadership than anything
else

05:42:01.190 --> 05:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
else
 
05:42:04.670 --> 05:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
let's keep it and and not walk around
 
05:42:07.128 --> 05:42:07.138 align:start position:0%
with a blindfold on thank you so
 
05:42:09.410 --> 05:42:09.420 align:start position:0%
remember yielded questions
 
05:42:09.420 --> 05:42:10.550 align:start position:0%
remember yielded questions
yeah

05:42:10.550 --> 05:42:10.560 align:start position:0%

05:42:18.770 --> 05:42:18.780 align:start position:0%
hi so
 
05:42:21.948 --> 05:42:21.958 align:start position:0%
um to clarify about the um
 
05:42:25.010 --> 05:42:25.020 align:start position:0%
point about the commission only having
 
05:42:28.310 --> 05:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
access existed for a year
 
05:42:30.050 --> 05:42:30.060 align:start position:0%
um that is
 
05:42:31.610 --> 05:42:31.620 align:start position:0%
if you
 
05:42:36.230 --> 05:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
um that that is due to a temporary lapse
 
05:42:39.770 --> 05:42:39.780 align:start position:0%
when it didn't exist so you could
 
05:42:39.780 --> 05:42:40.930 align:start position:0%
when it didn't exist so you could
um

05:42:40.930 --> 05:42:40.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:42:44.810 --> 05:42:44.820 align:start position:0%
would you agree that you could um
 
05:42:48.470 --> 05:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
count it as having existed for longer if
 
05:42:52.310 --> 05:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
you include the time from before the
 
05:42:54.590 --> 05:42:54.600 align:start position:0%
temporary stretch when it was previously
 
05:42:54.600 --> 05:42:59.750 align:start position:0%
temporary stretch when it was previously
repealed

05:43:05.930 --> 05:43:05.940 align:start position:0%

05:43:37.010 --> 05:43:37.020 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is ought to pass as
 
05:43:39.770 --> 05:43:39.780 align:start position:0%
amended on House Bill 228 are you ready
 
05:43:41.628 --> 05:43:41.638 align:start position:0%

commission on demographic Trends has
 
05:45:32.570 --> 05:45:32.580 align:start position:0%
been unable to be fully staffed due to
 
05:45:35.810 --> 05:45:35.820 align:start position:0%
not having the people available to serve
 
05:45:39.410 --> 05:45:39.420 align:start position:0%

the University of New Hampshire who do
 
05:45:44.330 --> 05:45:44.340 align:start position:0%
study demographics have kindly provided
 
05:45:46.310 --> 05:45:46.320 align:start position:0%
a great deal of demographic information
 
05:45:49.610 --> 05:45:49.620 align:start position:0%
to the legislature and the people of New
 
05:45:52.430 --> 05:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would I vote Yes to support
 
05:45:55.610 --> 05:45:55.620 align:start position:0%

05:59:06.410 --> 05:59:06.420 align:start position:0%
for what reason to memorize I I to ask a
 
05:59:09.650 --> 05:59:09.660 align:start position:0%
question of the speaker yes okay uh
 
05:59:12.470 --> 05:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
under Bill HB 572 which was the free
 
05:59:15.110 --> 05:59:15.120 align:start position:0%
school lunch program it clearly
 
05:59:17.448 --> 05:59:17.458 align:start position:0%
appropriate State funds so I'm just
 
05:59:19.430 --> 05:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
trying to understand why under house
 
05:59:22.010 --> 05:59:22.020 align:start position:0%
rule 47a that's not being referred to
 
05:59:24.230 --> 05:59:24.240 align:start position:0%
finance and why it was allowed to go to
 
05:59:25.730 --> 05:59:25.740 align:start position:0%
this point and because the rule
 
05:59:27.530 --> 05:59:27.540 align:start position:0%
explicitly says it has to go to finance
 
05:59:30.470 --> 05:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
maybe so why didn't it well I am not
 
05:59:32.150 --> 05:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
completely familiar with what you're
 
05:59:34.270 --> 05:59:34.280 align:start position:0%
talking about so
 
05:59:38.090 --> 05:59:38.100 align:start position:0%
and house rule 47a talks about two
 
05:59:38.100 --> 05:59:45.110 align:start position:0%
and house rule 47a talks about two
committees

05:59:45.110 --> 05:59:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:48.948 --> 05:59:48.958 align:start position:0%
when when we first assigned the bill uh
 
05:59:50.690 --> 05:59:50.700 align:start position:0%
and if you're asking me to remember why
 
05:59:52.610 --> 05:59:52.620 align:start position:0%
we didn't send it to finance at that
 
05:59:54.410 --> 05:59:54.420 align:start position:0%
point maybe we didn't have a financial
 
05:59:57.288 --> 05:59:57.298 align:start position:0%
statement at that point I I honestly
 
05:59:59.510 --> 05:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
don't remember okay well I guess my
 
06:00:01.730 --> 06:00:01.740 align:start position:0%
question is since it clearly is
 
06:00:04.250 --> 06:00:04.260 align:start position:0%
appropriating money and the rule clearly
 
06:00:06.288 --> 06:00:06.298 align:start position:0%
says that it's supposed to go to finance
 
06:00:09.530 --> 06:00:09.540 align:start position:0%
do we have any uh any alternative now
 
06:00:13.910 --> 06:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:17.270 --> 06:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
it was not designated as an early bill
 
06:00:19.490 --> 06:00:19.500 align:start position:0%
and therefore it
 
06:00:21.890 --> 06:00:21.900 align:start position:0%
it is not required to go to finance so
 
06:00:23.510 --> 06:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
again I'm not trying to be argumentative
 
06:00:25.670 --> 06:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
here but if someone makes a mistake and
 
06:00:27.590 --> 06:00:27.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't designated bill is an early bill
 
06:00:30.170 --> 06:00:30.180 align:start position:0%
then forever and ever it's not an early
 
06:00:32.448 --> 06:00:32.458 align:start position:0%
Bill even though the rule clearly says
 
06:00:34.430 --> 06:00:34.440 align:start position:0%
it should I'm not I don't not saying
 
06:00:36.170 --> 06:00:36.180 align:start position:0%
anybody made a mistake
 
06:00:39.770 --> 06:00:39.780 align:start position:0%
we did when we we assigned the bills it
 
06:00:43.788 --> 06:00:43.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:46.368 --> 06:00:46.378 align:start position:0%
so I don't it talks about spending all
 
06:00:52.430 --> 06:00:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:52.440 --> 06:01:00.650 align:start position:0%
 
just

06:01:00.650 --> 06:01:00.660 align:start position:0%

the purpose of Licensing is

resolution which was ATR a couple of
 
06:16:49.250 --> 06:16:49.260 align:start position:0%
terms ago I've brought it and it was

diversity
 
06:17:14.270 --> 06:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
let me give you an example I'm an
 
06:17:17.448 --> 06:17:17.458 align:start position:0%
immigrant a first generation immigrant I
 
06:17:19.788 --> 06:17:19.798 align:start position:0%
came to this country with a master's
 
06:17:23.390 --> 06:17:23.400 align:start position:0%
degree in my pocket and two suitcases
 
06:17:26.628 --> 06:17:26.638 align:start position:0%
and I made my home
 
06:17:31.628 --> 06:17:31.638 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire for over 35 years
 
06:17:35.990 --> 06:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
and I have seen the diversity what
 
06:17:39.890 --> 06:17:39.900 align:start position:0%
brought a lot more immigrants was Y2K
 
06:17:43.868 --> 06:17:43.878 align:start position:0%
many came to help through the transition
 
06:17:47.288 --> 06:17:47.298 align:start position:0%
and I can speak from
 
06:17:49.970 --> 06:17:49.980 align:start position:0%
my perspective where people who look
 
06:17:52.850 --> 06:17:52.860 align:start position:0%
like me who came from India and they
 
06:17:56.628 --> 06:17:56.638 align:start position:0%

06:20:28.490 --> 06:20:28.500 align:start position:0%
that we welcome
 
06:20:30.890 --> 06:20:30.900 align:start position:0%

06:20:53.810 --> 06:20:53.820 align:start position:0%
my kids were born and brought up here I
 
06:20:57.170 --> 06:20:57.180 align:start position:0%
have my grandkid now so this is
 
06:20:59.930 --> 06:20:59.940 align:start position:0%
something that we acknowledge we are all
 
06:20:59.940 --> 06:21:01.670 align:start position:0%
something that we acknowledge we are all
human

06:21:01.670 --> 06:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
human
 
06:21:03.890 --> 06:21:03.900 align:start position:0%
how do we make this
 
06:21:08.048 --> 06:21:08.058 align:start position:0%
our state even more vibrant so I ask you
 
06:21:12.350 --> 06:21:12.360 align:start position:0%
I plead that this is just a resolution I
 
06:21:14.868 --> 06:21:14.878 align:start position:0%
would love to see a overwhelming support
 
06:21:17.868 --> 06:21:17.878 align:start position:0%
to this resolution
 
06:21:17.878 --> 06:21:18.708 align:start position:0%
to this resolution
um

06:21:18.708 --> 06:21:18.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:21:24.230 --> 06:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
HR 11. Mr Speaker I asked for a division
 
06:21:28.548 --> 06:21:28.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:30.350 --> 06:21:30.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker and I thank my
 
06:21:32.990 --> 06:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
honorable colleague for her comments and
 
06:21:35.330 --> 06:21:35.340 align:start position:0%
I disagree with pretty much nothing that
 
06:21:37.250 --> 06:21:37.260 align:start position:0%
she said I think the values and the
 
06:21:38.990 --> 06:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
aspirations that we have as a society
 
06:21:41.510 --> 06:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
are as a general rule pointing in the
 
06:21:43.070 --> 06:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
same direction but the very fact that I
 
06:21:44.570 --> 06:21:44.580 align:start position:0%
can agree with all that and disagree
 
06:21:47.448 --> 06:21:47.458 align:start position:0%
with whether we should pass hr11 or not
 
06:21:50.330 --> 06:21:50.340 align:start position:0%
is a perfect illustration of why this
 
06:21:52.070 --> 06:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
bill is a problem
 
06:21:54.288 --> 06:21:54.298 align:start position:0%
the bill itself says that it urges that
 
06:21:55.910 --> 06:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
we as a body are going to urge
 
06:21:58.010 --> 06:21:58.020 align:start position:0%
subdivisions of the government local
 
06:22:00.590 --> 06:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
businesses individuals to hold
 
06:22:03.350 --> 06:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
appropriate celebrations for diversity
 
06:22:05.868 --> 06:22:05.878 align:start position:0%
throughout the entire month of September
 
06:22:07.788 --> 06:22:07.798 align:start position:0%
but defining what an appropriate
 
06:22:09.288 --> 06:22:09.298 align:start position:0%
celebration is and what will be
 
06:22:10.850 --> 06:22:10.860 align:start position:0%
welcoming to somebody is very difficult
 
06:22:11.750 --> 06:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
to do
 
06:22:14.510 --> 06:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
we experience this all of the time down
 
06:22:16.970 --> 06:22:16.980 align:start position:0%
here different Generations had different
 
06:22:20.208 --> 06:22:20.218 align:start position:0%
social norms as as they've gone through
 
06:22:22.430 --> 06:22:22.440 align:start position:0%
their life and some things that we say
 
06:22:24.288 --> 06:22:24.298 align:start position:0%
in one generation is offensive to the
 
06:22:25.610 --> 06:22:25.620 align:start position:0%
Next Generation even when we're trying
 
06:22:27.530 --> 06:22:27.540 align:start position:0%
to be welcoming and accepting of a
 
06:22:31.010 --> 06:22:31.020 align:start position:0%
certain idea so for example in 20 years
 
06:22:31.020 --> 06:22:32.270 align:start position:0%
certain idea so for example in 20 years
ago

06:22:32.270 --> 06:22:32.280 align:start position:0%
ago
 
06:22:35.030 --> 06:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
um calling people African Americans was
 
06:22:37.788 --> 06:22:37.798 align:start position:0%
basically the accepted general practice
 
06:22:39.590 --> 06:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
it was it was assumed to be the best way
 
06:22:40.788 --> 06:22:40.798 align:start position:0%
to handle it
 
06:22:43.250 --> 06:22:43.260 align:start position:0%
this generation it's not it's now people
 
06:22:44.270 --> 06:22:44.280 align:start position:0%
of color
 
06:22:46.310 --> 06:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
and some people are offended but you
 
06:22:47.570 --> 06:22:47.580 align:start position:0%
know I mean we have people from the
 
06:22:49.310 --> 06:22:49.320 align:start position:0%
Caribbean uh who move here as well
 
06:22:52.070 --> 06:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
they're not of African descent
 
06:22:53.868 --> 06:22:53.878 align:start position:0%
um and calling them an African-American
 
06:22:55.970 --> 06:22:55.980 align:start position:0%
isn't particularly welcoming to them so
 
06:22:57.830 --> 06:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
we may be trying to be welcoming and at
 
06:23:00.048 --> 06:23:00.058 align:start position:0%
the same time being alienating
 
06:23:01.430 --> 06:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
um and and that's the main problem with
 
06:23:03.288 --> 06:23:03.298 align:start position:0%
this with this legislation when we put
 
06:23:05.628 --> 06:23:05.638 align:start position:0%
our our backing behind it who gets to
 
06:23:07.850 --> 06:23:07.860 align:start position:0%
determine what's welcoming the person
 
06:23:09.288 --> 06:23:09.298 align:start position:0%
doing the welcoming or the person who's
 
06:23:11.448 --> 06:23:11.458 align:start position:0%
trying to be welcomed in because there's
 
06:23:13.490 --> 06:23:13.500 align:start position:0%
a lot of conflict that arises and and I
 
06:23:15.048 --> 06:23:15.058 align:start position:0%
think we all know this there's a lot of
 
06:23:16.548 --> 06:23:16.558 align:start position:0%
conflict that arises because of this
 
06:23:18.830 --> 06:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
kind of miscommunication and so the
 
06:23:20.090 --> 06:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill is good and I would
 
06:23:22.190 --> 06:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
guess I would just finish with this
 
06:23:22.200 --> 06:23:23.690 align:start position:0%
guess I would just finish with this
um

06:23:23.690 --> 06:23:23.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:23:26.030 --> 06:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
the title of the bill is compelling and
 
06:23:27.830 --> 06:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
at the title of a bill is enough to get
 
06:23:29.150 --> 06:23:29.160 align:start position:0%
you to vote for it then vote for this
 
06:23:29.160 --> 06:23:29.868 align:start position:0%
you to vote for it then vote for this
bill

06:23:29.868 --> 06:23:29.878 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:23:32.930 --> 06:23:32.940 align:start position:0%
the intentions of the sponsor are noble
 
06:23:35.090 --> 06:23:35.100 align:start position:0%
and the aspiration is good and if that's
 
06:23:36.830 --> 06:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
enough for you to vote for a bill then
 
06:23:38.208 --> 06:23:38.218 align:start position:0%
vote for this bill
 
06:23:41.208 --> 06:23:41.218 align:start position:0%
but if the philosophy that's being put
 
06:23:41.218 --> 06:23:42.288 align:start position:0%
but if the philosophy that's being put
forward

06:23:42.288 --> 06:23:42.298 align:start position:0%
forward
 
06:23:44.390 --> 06:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
is not capable of reaching the stated
 
06:23:46.070 --> 06:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
goal that it's that it's striving for
 
06:23:47.750 --> 06:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
but instead could actually undermine
 
06:23:49.910 --> 06:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
reaching that goal then I urge you to
 
06:23:52.070 --> 06:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
vote for me and vote this itl thank you
 
06:23:55.690 --> 06:23:55.700 align:start position:0%

06:27:11.090 --> 06:27:11.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
06:27:13.628 --> 06:27:13.638 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that
 
06:27:17.448 --> 06:27:17.458 align:start position:0%
HR stands for a resolution and not a
 
06:27:18.530 --> 06:27:18.540 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
06:27:20.708 --> 06:27:20.718 align:start position:0%
which is sort of like the recommendation
 
06:27:24.170 --> 06:27:24.180 align:start position:0%
and further if I know that in the city
 
06:27:29.868 --> 06:27:29.878 align:start position:0%
of Nashua has had a long long history
 
06:27:33.708 --> 06:27:33.718 align:start position:0%
of a welcoming City we had the English
 
06:27:37.010 --> 06:27:37.020 align:start position:0%
we had the Irish we had the Greeks the
 
06:27:39.948 --> 06:27:39.958 align:start position:0%
French and everybody picked up the Rope
 
06:27:42.708 --> 06:27:42.718 align:start position:0%
and yanked on that rope and pulled and
 
06:27:46.070 --> 06:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
made a better America for it and if I
 
06:27:49.010 --> 06:27:49.020 align:start position:0%
further know that most corporations do
 
06:27:51.890 --> 06:27:51.900 align:start position:0%
branding and in branding is here trying
 
06:27:54.288 --> 06:27:54.298 align:start position:0%
to sell a product and that's what we're
 
06:27:57.530 --> 06:27:57.540 align:start position:0%
selling here do you remember like I do
 
06:27:59.930 --> 06:27:59.940 align:start position:0%
that the old license plates Mr Speaker
 
06:28:03.770 --> 06:28:03.780 align:start position:0%
used to say welcome to Scenic New
 
06:28:03.780 --> 06:28:05.330 align:start position:0%
used to say welcome to Scenic New
Hampshire

06:28:05.330 --> 06:28:05.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
06:28:08.510 --> 06:28:08.520 align:start position:0%
now our license plate says Live Free or
 
06:28:12.470 --> 06:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
Die then please explain to me how you
 
06:28:14.868 --> 06:28:14.878 align:start position:0%
can live free and die and don't welcome
 
06:28:19.490 --> 06:28:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:21.230 --> 06:28:21.240 align:start position:0%
Geo recognize representative Carol
 
06:28:31.548 --> 06:28:31.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:33.890 --> 06:28:33.900 align:start position:0%
have the authority to declare themselves
 
06:28:37.250 --> 06:28:37.260 align:start position:0%
welcoming communities and celebrate it
 
06:28:38.930 --> 06:28:38.940 align:start position:0%
however they wish
 
06:28:41.930 --> 06:28:41.940 align:start position:0%
and if I also know that there's no
 
06:28:44.510 --> 06:28:44.520 align:start position:0%
consensus on what a welcoming Community
 
06:28:47.990 --> 06:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
does compared to any other community
 
06:28:50.390 --> 06:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
and so if I know that it's not clear
 
06:28:52.850 --> 06:28:52.860 align:start position:0%
what this resolution would accomplish if
 
06:28:55.610 --> 06:28:55.620 align:start position:0%
anything would I not press the green

06:31:59.868 --> 06:31:59.878 align:start position:0%
popular demand evidently uh
 
06:32:02.448 --> 06:32:02.458 align:start position:0%
what we have before us on this amendment
 
06:32:05.090 --> 06:32:05.100 align:start position:0%
is quite different than what was written
 
06:32:07.368 --> 06:32:07.378 align:start position:0%
in the original bill
 
06:32:10.430 --> 06:32:10.440 align:start position:0%
the original bill was supposed to be
 
06:32:13.610 --> 06:32:13.620 align:start position:0%
intended as tax relief
 
06:32:15.830 --> 06:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
to our constituents
 
06:32:19.070 --> 06:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
now on this amendment what it will do
 
06:32:22.250 --> 06:32:22.260 align:start position:0%
will take the money and appropriate it
 
06:32:25.490 --> 06:32:25.500 align:start position:0%
into the unfunded liability
 
06:32:27.530 --> 06:32:27.540 align:start position:0%
but ladies and gentlemen of this
 
06:32:29.150 --> 06:32:29.160 align:start position:0%
esteemed body
 
06:32:31.850 --> 06:32:31.860 align:start position:0%
the unfunded liability is a moving
 
06:32:31.860 --> 06:32:33.110 align:start position:0%
the unfunded liability is a moving
Target

06:32:33.110 --> 06:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
Target
 
06:32:35.990 --> 06:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
they say that it's supposed to be taken
 
06:32:40.670 --> 06:32:40.680 align:start position:0%
care of by 2039 well go ask that if they
 
06:32:42.890 --> 06:32:42.900 align:start position:0%
certify that in writing
 
06:32:44.930 --> 06:32:44.940 align:start position:0%
they won't
 
06:32:48.948 --> 06:32:48.958 align:start position:0%
it could go a little bit longer and if
 
06:32:52.368 --> 06:32:52.378 align:start position:0%
the stock market improves it may even be
 
06:32:55.448 --> 06:32:55.458 align:start position:0%
shorter but they have it on the books to
 
06:32:59.868 --> 06:32:59.878 align:start position:0%
2039 now the original bill would take
 
06:33:02.990 --> 06:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
that money and apply it to the cities
 
06:33:05.930 --> 06:33:05.940 align:start position:0%
and towns we all know the things that we
 
06:33:08.810 --> 06:33:08.820 align:start position:0%
fought together we forgot we fought
 
06:33:12.350 --> 06:33:12.360 align:start position:0%
covid we try to get Alternative Learning
 
06:33:15.910 --> 06:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
I know in Nashua we try to get
 
06:33:18.708 --> 06:33:18.718 align:start position:0%
computers for the kids and stuff like
 
06:33:21.770 --> 06:33:21.780 align:start position:0%
that right now a lot of cities and towns
 
06:33:23.810 --> 06:33:23.820 align:start position:0%
are cash strapped
 
06:33:27.470 --> 06:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
and by following the original Bill not
 
06:33:29.208 --> 06:33:29.218 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
06:33:31.850 --> 06:33:31.860 align:start position:0%
what will that will free up the money
 
06:33:31.860 --> 06:33:33.048 align:start position:0%
what will that will free up the money
now

06:33:33.048 --> 06:33:33.058 align:start position:0%
now
 
06:33:35.510 --> 06:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
in Nashua that's the sum approximately
 
06:33:38.510 --> 06:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
almost two million dollars which would
 
06:33:39.830 --> 06:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
help out
 
06:33:43.548 --> 06:33:43.558 align:start position:0%
and Mr Speaker also if you remember last
 
06:33:46.490 --> 06:33:46.500 align:start position:0%
year this body voted
 
06:33:49.490 --> 06:33:49.500 align:start position:0%
to take this particular bill was one of
 
06:33:51.410 --> 06:33:51.420 align:start position:0%

06:34:04.910 --> 06:34:04.920 align:start position:0%

work
 
06:34:30.650 --> 06:34:30.660 align:start position:0%
and by making the benefits better then
 
06:34:32.330 --> 06:34:32.340 align:start position:0%
you're going to have the people
 
06:34:33.890 --> 06:34:33.900 align:start position:0%

satisfy the immediate needs not
 
06:34:53.750 --> 06:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
something that's attached to 2039 which
 
06:34:56.390 --> 06:34:56.400 align:start position:0%
is a long way away many legislative
 
06:34:59.270 --> 06:34:59.280 align:start position:0%

06:35:04.310 --> 06:35:04.320 align:start position:0%

please support me in killing the
 
06:35:13.788 --> 06:35:13.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:15.890 --> 06:35:15.900 align:start position:0%
I recognize representative Dan Maguire
 
06:35:18.410 --> 06:35:18.420 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker excuse me may I have a
 
06:35:20.868 --> 06:35:20.878 align:start position:0%
division vote on that
 
06:35:22.670 --> 06:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
chair recognize representative Dan
 
06:35:22.680 --> 06:35:24.650 align:start position:0%
chair recognize representative Dan
Maguire

06:35:24.650 --> 06:35:24.660 align:start position:0%
Maguire
 
06:35:27.530 --> 06:35:27.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
06:35:30.948 --> 06:35:30.958 align:start position:0%
the decision you're about to make is not
 
06:35:33.708 --> 06:35:33.718 align:start position:0%
about whether to spend 50 million
 
06:35:36.948 --> 06:35:36.958 align:start position:0%
dollars but how to spend 50 million
 
06:35:39.830 --> 06:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
dollars following this vote however it
 
06:35:42.470 --> 06:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
goes I will be making a motion to table
 
06:35:46.910 --> 06:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
this bill so that it can re be reborn as
 
06:35:49.730 --> 06:35:49.740 align:start position:0%
part of the budget
 
06:35:53.868 --> 06:35:53.878 align:start position:0%
we have a serious debt problem in the
 
06:35:56.390 --> 06:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
retirement system
 
06:35:59.570 --> 06:35:59.580 align:start position:0%
more than half of the money going to the
 
06:36:03.288 --> 06:36:03.298 align:start position:0%
retirement system is being used to pay
 
06:36:05.448 --> 06:36:05.458 align:start position:0%
down that debt
 
06:36:10.310 --> 06:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
so it's greater than 10 percent of all
 
06:36:13.368 --> 06:36:13.378 align:start position:0%
the salaries of all the public employees
 
06:36:16.490 --> 06:36:16.500 align:start position:0%
in the state all Municipal teachers
 
06:36:20.208 --> 06:36:20.218 align:start position:0%
police fires state employees Etc more
 
06:36:23.270 --> 06:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
than 10 percent of their salaries is
 
06:36:25.970 --> 06:36:25.980 align:start position:0%
going to pay down debt
 
06:36:28.850 --> 06:36:28.860 align:start position:0%
this is a huge amount of money if you
 
06:36:31.548 --> 06:36:31.558 align:start position:0%
think about it if we had no debt all
 
06:36:33.470 --> 06:36:33.480 align:start position:0%
those employees could be paid 10 percent
 
06:36:35.990 --> 06:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
more or we could have 10 percent more
 
06:36:37.970 --> 06:36:37.980 align:start position:0%
employees or we could have money for
 
06:36:40.970 --> 06:36:40.980 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:45.788 --> 06:36:45.798 align:start position:0%
so what this bill does is rather than
 
06:36:50.448 --> 06:36:50.458 align:start position:0%
give employers money for just this
 
06:36:52.730 --> 06:36:52.740 align:start position:0%
coming biennium
 
06:36:54.850 --> 06:36:54.860 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
06:36:58.430 --> 06:36:58.440 align:start position:0%
pays down that debt so that employers
 
06:37:02.208 --> 06:37:02.218 align:start position:0%
will have lower rates from now until the
 
06:37:04.548 --> 06:37:04.558 align:start position:0%
debt is retired
 
06:37:07.510 --> 06:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
because when we give them a dollar today
 
06:37:10.850 --> 06:37:10.860 align:start position:0%
that's a dollar six we don't have to
 
06:37:14.208 --> 06:37:14.218 align:start position:0%
give them next year or a dollar fourteen
 
06:37:16.490 --> 06:37:16.500 align:start position:0%
the year after that or a dollar twenty
 
06:37:19.070 --> 06:37:19.080 align:start position:0%
the year after that and so on right
 
06:37:21.890 --> 06:37:21.900 align:start position:0%
because the retirement system expects to
 
06:37:29.690 --> 06:37:29.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:33.170 --> 06:37:33.180 align:start position:0%
all right so this bill will result as I
 
06:37:36.410 --> 06:37:36.420 align:start position:0%
said in a savings of a hundred and five
 
06:37:38.690 --> 06:37:38.700 align:start position:0%
million dollars this amendment will
 
06:37:41.448 --> 06:37:41.458 align:start position:0%
result in a savings of 105 million
 
06:37:45.350 --> 06:37:45.360 align:start position:0%
dollars to towns two employers over the
 
06:37:45.360 --> 06:37:46.850 align:start position:0%
dollars to towns two employers over the
next

06:37:46.850 --> 06:37:46.860 align:start position:0%
next
 
06:37:50.330 --> 06:37:50.340 align:start position:0%
um close to two decades
 
06:37:52.368 --> 06:37:52.378 align:start position:0%
this amendment is supported by the
 
06:37:55.430 --> 06:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
municipal Association it was unanimously
 
06:37:58.250 --> 06:37:58.260 align:start position:0%
supported in division one of Finance it
 
06:38:01.490 --> 06:38:01.500 align:start position:0%
had a very strong vote a bipartisan vote
 
06:38:04.730 --> 06:38:04.740 align:start position:0%
in the full finance committee
 
06:38:07.910 --> 06:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
in some sense the original bill is like
 
06:38:10.010 --> 06:38:10.020 align:start position:0%
a sugary dessert
 
06:38:12.590 --> 06:38:12.600 align:start position:0%
you know and I understand the
 
06:38:15.470 --> 06:38:15.480 align:start position:0%
attractions of that believe me
 
06:38:18.948 --> 06:38:18.958 align:start position:0%
but what the body politic needs is a
 
06:38:18.958 --> 06:38:20.410 align:start position:0%
but what the body politic needs is a
nutritionist

06:38:20.410 --> 06:38:20.420 align:start position:0%
nutritionist
 
06:38:24.590 --> 06:38:24.600 align:start position:0%
nutritional meal not a dessert
 
06:38:27.948 --> 06:38:27.958 align:start position:0%
so please vote green on this motion
 
06:38:32.110 --> 06:38:32.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:35.330 --> 06:38:35.340 align:start position:0%
this is going to be a division vote
 
06:39:12.048 --> 06:39:12.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:39.948 --> 06:39:39.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:42.048 --> 06:39:42.058 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is to adopt
 
06:39:42.058 --> 06:39:43.628 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is to adopt

okay if I know this amendment changes
 
06:40:23.570 --> 06:40:23.580 align:start position:0%
yearly direct support which over the
 
06:40:25.310 --> 06:40:25.320 align:start position:0%
two decades will probably be in the
 
06:40:29.448 --> 06:40:29.458 align:start position:0%
range total out to be about 600 million
 
06:40:32.030 --> 06:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
to towns and cities to a one-time
 
06:40:34.850 --> 06:40:34.860 align:start position:0%
payment against the unfunded accrued
 
06:40:36.708 --> 06:40:36.718 align:start position:0%
liability of the New Hampshire
 
06:40:39.230 --> 06:40:39.240 align:start position:0%
Retirement System
 
06:40:41.330 --> 06:40:41.340 align:start position:0%
if I know this yearly support was
 
06:40:43.910 --> 06:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
promised by the state when it convinced
 
06:40:46.368 --> 06:40:46.378 align:start position:0%
the towns cities and counties
 
06:40:50.990 --> 06:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
to join a Consolidated Retirement System
 
06:40:53.930 --> 06:40:53.940 align:start position:0%
if I know towns cities and counties
 
06:40:56.810 --> 06:40:56.820 align:start position:0%
prefer to get yearly direct payments to
 
06:40:59.628 --> 06:40:59.638 align:start position:0%
help offset the cost of benefits to
 
06:41:02.330 --> 06:41:02.340 align:start position:0%
police firefighters and teachers instead
 
06:41:05.270 --> 06:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
of indirect but helpful

members recognized for a parliamentary
 
06:46:30.240 --> 06:46:31.430 align:start position:0%
members recognized for a parliamentary
inquiry

06:46:31.430 --> 06:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
inquiry

06:46:38.090 --> 06:46:38.100 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker this is a true parliamentary
 
06:46:41.810 --> 06:46:41.820 align:start position:0%
inquiry because I this is a very new
 
06:46:44.270 --> 06:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
procedure for us although it's regular
 
06:46:47.690 --> 06:46:47.700 align:start position:0%
procedure in the Senate and I'm always a
 
06:46:49.310 --> 06:46:49.320 align:start position:0%
little suspicious of doing things the
 
06:46:51.530 --> 06:46:51.540 align:start position:0%
way the body on the other side which I
 
06:46:54.410 --> 06:46:54.420 align:start position:0%
should not have mentioned does things
 
06:46:54.420 --> 06:46:56.208 align:start position:0%
should not have mentioned does things
uh

06:46:56.208 --> 06:46:56.218 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:46:59.990 --> 06:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
if we don't table this bill is there
 
06:47:02.330 --> 06:47:02.340 align:start position:0%
anything that prohibits it being rolled
 
06:47:05.390 --> 06:47:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:05.400 --> 06:47:06.948 align:start position:0%
 
no

06:47:06.948 --> 06:47:06.958 align:start position:0%
no
 
06:47:14.628 --> 06:47:14.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:16.730 --> 06:47:16.740 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the table house
 
06:47:25.390 --> 06:47:25.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:28.250 --> 06:47:28.260 align:start position:0%
do you recognize representative O'Brien
 
06:47:31.368 --> 06:47:31.378 align:start position:0%
for parliamentary inquiry thank you
 
06:47:34.910 --> 06:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
uh again popular demand uh if you
 
06:47:36.948 --> 06:47:36.958 align:start position:0%
believe Mr Speaker if you believe this I
 
06:47:40.670 --> 06:47:40.680 align:start position:0%
do that the gentleman brought forward a
 
06:47:44.868 --> 06:47:44.878 align:start position:0%
bill and I think he stated how this was
 
06:47:47.750 --> 06:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
supposed to be to Panacea yet
 
06:47:51.350 --> 06:47:51.360 align:start position:0%
comes right back with a motion to table
 
06:47:53.690 --> 06:47:53.700 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that really you know
 
06:47:57.048 --> 06:47:57.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:01.070 --> 06:48:01.080 align:start position:0%
so Mr Speaker what should one do I ask
 
06:48:04.190 --> 06:48:04.200 align:start position:0%
you what I would do is vote down the
 
06:48:07.128 --> 06:48:07.138 align:start position:0%
motion to table and let's get on with
 
06:48:09.948 --> 06:48:09.958 align:start position:0%
the debate and keep the uh to Bill alive
 
06:48:12.590 --> 06:48:12.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker if the intentions
 
06:48:15.230 --> 06:48:15.240 align:start position:0%
are well intended
 
06:48:16.910 --> 06:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
okay I recognize representative Dan
 
06:48:20.150 --> 06:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
Maguire from parliamentary inquiry
 
06:48:23.150 --> 06:48:23.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker if I know that the
 
06:48:25.128 --> 06:48:25.138 align:start position:0%
finance committee could have retained
 
06:48:28.510 --> 06:48:28.520 align:start position:0%
this bill but we wish to ask this body
 
06:48:32.868 --> 06:48:32.878 align:start position:0%
what policy they wanted to have how we
 
06:48:34.670 --> 06:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to spend this money
 
06:48:37.610 --> 06:48:37.620 align:start position:0%
and if I know that that policy has now
 
06:48:40.670 --> 06:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
been decided and if I know that by
 
06:48:43.730 --> 06:48:43.740 align:start position:0%
tabling this bill it will become part of
 
06:48:46.850 --> 06:48:46.860 align:start position:0%
the budget and if I know that as part of
 
06:48:49.968 --> 06:48:49.978 align:start position:0%
the budget it will have that much more
 
06:48:52.850 --> 06:48:52.860 align:start position:0%
strength in terms of our future
 
06:48:56.030 --> 06:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
negotiations with the other body
 
06:48:58.128 --> 06:48:58.138 align:start position:0%
and if I know that if we left it simply
 
06:49:00.468 --> 06:49:00.478 align:start position:0%
as a bill and passed it over the other
 
06:49:02.750 --> 06:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
body they could just as easily get rid
 
06:49:03.708 --> 06:49:03.718 align:start position:0%
of it
 
06:49:05.810 --> 06:49:05.820 align:start position:0%

06:52:15.708 --> 06:52:15.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:18.890 --> 06:52:18.900 align:start position:0%
good afternoon colleagues
 
06:52:18.900 --> 06:52:20.448 align:start position:0%
good afternoon colleagues
and

06:52:20.448 --> 06:52:20.458 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:52:24.048 --> 06:52:24.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:25.610 --> 06:52:25.620 align:start position:0%
okay so here's what we're talking about
 
06:52:29.330 --> 06:52:29.340 align:start position:0%
in the town of dairy which I represent
 
06:52:29.340 --> 06:52:30.708 align:start position:0%
in the town of dairy which I represent
the

06:52:30.708 --> 06:52:30.718 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:52:33.410 --> 06:52:33.420 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation is adding
 
06:52:37.070 --> 06:52:37.080 align:start position:0%
an exit to Interstate 93.
 
06:52:39.110 --> 06:52:39.120 align:start position:0%
that exit
 
06:52:41.990 --> 06:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
will come across into
 
06:52:43.548 --> 06:52:43.558 align:start position:0%
because it's in Londonderry we'll come
 
06:52:46.310 --> 06:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
across into Dairy and it will cross the
 
06:52:48.350 --> 06:52:48.360 align:start position:0%
protected historic Railroad Bed that we
 
06:52:51.368 --> 06:52:51.378 align:start position:0%
have in the town of Derry
 
06:52:53.390 --> 06:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
there were public hearings that were
 
06:52:54.948 --> 06:52:54.958 align:start position:0%
done there was designs that were brought
 
06:52:54.958 --> 06:52:56.208 align:start position:0%
done there was designs that were brought
forward

06:52:56.208 --> 06:52:56.218 align:start position:0%
forward
 
06:52:57.948 --> 06:52:57.958 align:start position:0%
and everything was going along pretty
 
06:52:59.868 --> 06:52:59.878 align:start position:0%
good and then the Department of
 
06:53:01.788 --> 06:53:01.798 align:start position:0%
Transportation decided at kind of the
 
06:53:03.530 --> 06:53:03.540 align:start position:0%
last minute to make a change
 
06:53:07.610 --> 06:53:07.620 align:start position:0%
and we had to force them to do another
 
06:53:09.410 --> 06:53:09.420 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
06:53:11.570 --> 06:53:11.580 align:start position:0%
which was really done really done at the
 
06:53:15.230 --> 06:53:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:17.628 --> 06:53:17.638 align:start position:0%
and what that did was it removed a box
 
06:53:20.510 --> 06:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
tunnel underneath a six-lane road on
 
06:53:21.530 --> 06:53:21.540 align:start position:0%
this exit
 
06:53:24.110 --> 06:53:24.120 align:start position:0%
which would easily fit into this room
 
06:53:25.910 --> 06:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
actually it would fit into half of this
 
06:53:25.920 --> 06:53:26.750 align:start position:0%
actually it would fit into half of this
room

06:53:26.750 --> 06:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
room
 
06:53:28.788 --> 06:53:28.798 align:start position:0%
so that the folks that use the rail
 
06:53:31.190 --> 06:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
trail system could go underneath rather
 
06:53:35.750 --> 06:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
than either across a six-lane road or
 
06:53:38.150 --> 06:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
an alternative design which was a
 
06:53:40.968 --> 06:53:40.978 align:start position:0%
quarter mile out of the way
 
06:53:43.368 --> 06:53:43.378 align:start position:0%
under a bridge and next to a flooded a
 
06:53:45.948 --> 06:53:45.958 align:start position:0%
brook that floods all the time
 
06:53:47.990 --> 06:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
the important point of this here is that
 
06:53:49.670 --> 06:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
the Town Council in Derry did not ask
 
06:53:51.170 --> 06:53:51.180 align:start position:0%
for this change
 
06:53:53.208 --> 06:53:53.218 align:start position:0%
the Public Works director of dairy sent
 
06:53:54.288 --> 06:53:54.298 align:start position:0%
a letter to the Department of
 
06:53:56.930 --> 06:53:56.940 align:start position:0%
Transportation saying I do not want this
 
06:53:59.330 --> 06:53:59.340 align:start position:0%
change not a single member of the public
 
06:54:01.730 --> 06:54:01.740 align:start position:0%
asked for this not a single stakeholder
 
06:54:03.468 --> 06:54:03.478 align:start position:0%
asked for this
 
06:54:05.930 --> 06:54:05.940 align:start position:0%
the UNH handicap Mobility group said
 
06:54:09.048 --> 06:54:09.058 align:start position:0%
this redesign is not workable
 
06:54:11.390 --> 06:54:11.400 align:start position:0%
this redesign puts at a five degree
 
06:54:15.170 --> 06:54:15.180 align:start position:0%
pitch a 530 foot long
 
06:54:18.770 --> 06:54:18.780 align:start position:0%
Lane that someone in a wheelchair cannot
 
06:54:18.780 --> 06:54:20.750 align:start position:0%
Lane that someone in a wheelchair cannot
Traverse

06:54:20.750 --> 06:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
Traverse
 
06:54:23.628 --> 06:54:23.638 align:start position:0%
the Boston office of the EPA has
 
06:54:26.510 --> 06:54:26.520 align:start position:0%
concerns about this relocation
 
06:54:30.170 --> 06:54:30.180 align:start position:0%
and the D.O.T has refused to listen to
 
06:54:32.990 --> 06:54:33.000 align:start position:0%
the people of dairy in its state and the
 
06:54:35.448 --> 06:54:35.458 align:start position:0%
stakeholders that maintain this rail
 
06:54:37.128 --> 06:54:37.138 align:start position:0%
trail system
 
06:54:40.368 --> 06:54:40.378 align:start position:0%
to quote a DOT engineer this is an
 
06:54:42.830 --> 06:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
integral part of the Statewide trail
 
06:54:42.840 --> 06:54:45.230 align:start position:0%
integral part of the Statewide trail
system

06:54:45.230 --> 06:54:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:48.110 --> 06:54:48.120 align:start position:0%
so if it's an integral part why are you
 
06:54:50.208 --> 06:54:50.218 align:start position:0%
jacking with it
 
06:54:52.368 --> 06:54:52.378 align:start position:0%
this will have an effect on Salem
 
06:54:55.368 --> 06:54:55.378 align:start position:0%
Wyndham Dairy Londonderry and Manchester
 
06:54:59.030 --> 06:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
this is not a town park this is part of
 
06:55:02.810 --> 06:55:02.820 align:start position:0%
the larger state recreational concept of
 
06:55:06.288 --> 06:55:06.298 align:start position:0%
the rail system rail trail system
 
06:55:10.128 --> 06:55:10.138 align:start position:0%
when a state agency refuses to listen to
 
06:55:13.430 --> 06:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
the people the only recourse is to bring
 
06:55:15.650 --> 06:55:15.660 align:start position:0%
that issue to the people's house
 
06:55:20.150 --> 06:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:22.490 --> 06:55:22.500 align:start position:0%
and like I said this is part of a
 
06:55:25.010 --> 06:55:25.020 align:start position:0%
Federal Highway project a project that
 
06:55:27.948 --> 06:55:27.958 align:start position:0%
received Federal approval with the Box
 
06:55:31.128 --> 06:55:31.138 align:start position:0%
tunnel in the design and currently now
 
06:55:32.990 --> 06:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
this project does not have Federal
 
06:55:33.000 --> 06:55:36.650 align:start position:0%
this project does not have Federal
approval

06:55:36.650 --> 06:55:36.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:39.948 --> 06:55:39.958 align:start position:0%
when this came before the committee
 
06:55:41.930 --> 06:55:41.940 align:start position:0%
the Department of Transportation sent
 
06:55:44.868 --> 06:55:44.878 align:start position:0%
someone to argue
 
06:55:46.730 --> 06:55:46.740 align:start position:0%
as to why they shouldn't do it that
 
06:55:51.708 --> 06:55:51.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:53.868 --> 06:55:53.878 align:start position:0%
the Department of Transportation wants
 
06:55:56.448 --> 06:55:56.458 align:start position:0%
to talk about delays in the project this
 
06:55:59.030 --> 06:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
project started when I was six
 
06:56:01.250 --> 06:56:01.260 align:start position:0%
years old
 
06:56:04.490 --> 06:56:04.500 align:start position:0%
and has been delayed 15 times oh by the
 
06:56:07.368 --> 06:56:07.378 align:start position:0%
way it was delayed six days ago another
 
06:56:09.230 --> 06:56:09.240 align:start position:0%
six months
 
06:56:12.468 --> 06:56:12.478 align:start position:0%
so I'm asking you to overturn this itl
 
06:56:13.910 --> 06:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
so we can tell the Department of
 
06:56:16.368 --> 06:56:16.378 align:start position:0%
Transportation to please listen to the
 
06:56:21.230 --> 06:56:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:23.810 --> 06:56:23.820 align:start position:0%
and build what's right so that I don't
 
06:56:25.730 --> 06:56:25.740 align:start position:0%
have to shut the rail trail off in my
 
06:56:27.530 --> 06:56:27.540 align:start position:0%
community to the folks that are
 
06:56:34.128 --> 06:56:34.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:37.070 --> 06:56:37.080 align:start position:0%
do you recognized representative Gould
 
06:56:37.080 --> 06:56:44.890 align:start position:0%
do you recognized representative Gould
from

06:56:44.890 --> 06:56:44.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:48.110 --> 06:56:48.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker I am feeling good
 
06:56:51.288 --> 06:56:51.298 align:start position:0%
on the missing Minority Report on hb506
 
06:56:53.628 --> 06:56:53.638 align:start position:0%
relative to the construction of a rail
 
06:56:56.868 --> 06:56:56.878 align:start position:0%
trail box tunnel on Exit 4 A
 
06:56:59.628 --> 06:56:59.638 align:start position:0%
one originally in the finance division
 
06:57:03.708 --> 06:57:03.718 align:start position:0%
one subcommittee six voted to retain and
 
06:57:08.208 --> 06:57:08.218 align:start position:0%
two voted to itl on February 15th when
 
06:57:10.610 --> 06:57:10.620 align:start position:0%
presented to the full finance committee
 
06:57:13.610 --> 06:57:13.620 align:start position:0%
on March 15 the motion was given that
 
06:57:16.128 --> 06:57:16.138 align:start position:0%
the vote was itl
 
06:57:18.708 --> 06:57:18.718 align:start position:0%
second in regard to the majority report
 
06:57:20.810 --> 06:57:20.820 align:start position:0%
in the calendar saying that the
 
06:57:22.788 --> 06:57:22.798 align:start position:0%
committee was unwilling to second-guess
 
06:57:26.690 --> 06:57:26.700 align:start position:0%
D.O.T or to delay the project I would
 
06:57:29.948 --> 06:57:29.958 align:start position:0%
like to say that there are still
 
06:57:33.770 --> 06:57:33.780 align:start position:0%
97 properties to be purchased by dots
 
06:57:36.110 --> 06:57:36.120 align:start position:0%
through eminent domain
 
06:57:40.850 --> 06:57:40.860 align:start position:0%
uh also the revised environmental impact
 
06:57:43.430 --> 06:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
have still not been approved for the
 
06:57:46.310 --> 06:57:46.320 align:start position:0%
proposed New Hampshire dot rail trail
 
06:57:48.430 --> 06:57:48.440 align:start position:0%
plan alternative
 
06:57:51.770 --> 06:57:51.780 align:start position:0%
approvals were obtained for the original
 
06:57:56.930 --> 06:57:56.940 align:start position:0%
plans including the tunnel in 2019.
 
06:57:59.868 --> 06:57:59.878 align:start position:0%
this tunnel issue is not delaying the
 
06:57:59.878 --> 06:58:00.890 align:start position:0%
this tunnel issue is not delaying the
project

06:58:00.890 --> 06:58:00.900 align:start position:0%
project
 
06:58:03.830 --> 06:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire dot alternative is
 
06:58:05.948 --> 06:58:05.958 align:start position:0%
causing the delay
 
06:58:09.170 --> 06:58:09.180 align:start position:0%
fourth a key safety point and trail
 
06:58:12.070 --> 06:58:12.080 align:start position:0%
design is keeping the bike ped traffic
 
06:58:14.690 --> 06:58:14.700 align:start position:0%
separated from motor traffic
 
06:58:18.350 --> 06:58:18.360 align:start position:0%
without the tunnel Trail users would be
 
06:58:22.128 --> 06:58:22.138 align:start position:0%
enticed across six Lanes of traffic
 
06:58:24.890 --> 06:58:24.900 align:start position:0%
the town of Derry opposes this Crossing
 
06:58:27.410 --> 06:58:27.420 align:start position:0%
and wants the tunnel
 
06:58:30.230 --> 06:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
fifth it came to my attention last week
 
06:58:33.410 --> 06:58:33.420 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire D.O.T pushed out the
 
06:58:36.708 --> 06:58:36.718 align:start position:0%
dairy Connector Road Project bid date
 
06:58:41.468 --> 06:58:41.478 align:start position:0%
from October 2023 this year to March
 
06:58:45.730 --> 06:58:45.740 align:start position:0%
2024 next year with actual construction
 
06:58:50.110 --> 06:58:50.120 align:start position:0%
not likely until 2025.
 
06:58:53.628 --> 06:58:53.638 align:start position:0%
restoring the panel plan will not have a
 
06:58:56.030 --> 06:58:56.040 align:start position:0%
major impact on the project completion
 
06:58:56.040 --> 06:58:56.868 align:start position:0%
major impact on the project completion
date

06:58:56.868 --> 06:58:56.878 align:start position:0%
date
 
06:58:59.690 --> 06:58:59.700 align:start position:0%
there is only one chance to incorporate
 
06:59:03.048 --> 06:59:03.058 align:start position:0%
the proper and safe design and the time
 
06:59:04.128 --> 06:59:04.138 align:start position:0%
is now
 
06:59:06.288 --> 06:59:06.298 align:start position:0%
it is an issue that people who voted
 
06:59:07.628 --> 06:59:07.638 align:start position:0%
against the tunnel approach
 
06:59:09.948 --> 06:59:09.958 align:start position:0%
appropriation perhaps don't understand
 
06:59:13.010 --> 06:59:13.020 align:start position:0%
completely there are a lot of missing
 
06:59:15.110 --> 06:59:15.120 align:start position:0%
pieces to this mystery
 
06:59:18.170 --> 06:59:18.180 align:start position:0%
this project should be approved press
 
06:59:21.230 --> 06:59:21.240 align:start position:0%
the bread button to oppose the itl
 
06:59:23.510 --> 06:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
so that the motion of ought to pass can
 
06:59:27.468 --> 06:59:27.478 align:start position:0%
be given press the red button thank you
 
06:59:34.070 --> 06:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:36.948 --> 06:59:36.958 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker I decided not to
 
06:59:39.730 --> 06:59:39.740 align:start position:0%
take my chances with that microphone
 
06:59:39.740 --> 06:59:41.410 align:start position:0%
take my chances with that microphone
so

06:59:41.410 --> 06:59:41.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:59:45.110 --> 06:59:45.120 align:start position:0%
this is a bill came to us in finance
 
06:59:48.468 --> 06:59:48.478 align:start position:0%
division one we spent many many days on
 
06:59:50.448 --> 06:59:50.458 align:start position:0%
it more than any other bill that came to
 
06:59:53.030 --> 06:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
us including the one you just voted on
 
06:59:56.570 --> 06:59:56.580 align:start position:0%
um and it's it's as you can tell the
 
06:59:58.850 --> 06:59:58.860 align:start position:0%
advocates for this bill are very very
 
06:59:58.860 --> 07:00:00.230 align:start position:0%
advocates for this bill are very very
passionate

07:00:00.230 --> 07:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
passionate
 
07:00:02.628 --> 07:00:02.638 align:start position:0%
but basically what they're asking us to
 
07:00:04.430 --> 07:00:04.440 align:start position:0%
do is
 
07:00:08.750 --> 07:00:08.760 align:start position:0%
a sense play civil engineer and tell dot
 
07:00:11.330 --> 07:00:11.340 align:start position:0%
they don't know their business and they
 
07:00:13.448 --> 07:00:13.458 align:start position:0%
should do something different
 
07:00:17.390 --> 07:00:17.400 align:start position:0%
and our committee uh looked into it
 
07:00:19.670 --> 07:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
looked into all the allegations we
 
07:00:21.948 --> 07:00:21.958 align:start position:0%
visited the site and let me tell you
 
07:00:24.170 --> 07:00:24.180 align:start position:0%
about the site the place where this is
 
07:00:26.570 --> 07:00:26.580 align:start position:0%
going to happen right now does not have
 
07:00:28.430 --> 07:00:28.440 align:start position:0%
the trail at all so part of the project
 
07:00:31.368 --> 07:00:31.378 align:start position:0%
is to build this little section of the
 
07:00:31.378 --> 07:00:32.750 align:start position:0%
is to build this little section of the
trail

07:00:32.750 --> 07:00:32.760 align:start position:0%
trail
 
07:00:36.650 --> 07:00:36.660 align:start position:0%
the site is a couple of miles away from
 
07:00:39.288 --> 07:00:39.298 align:start position:0%
I-93 so this is crossing of the
 
07:00:41.810 --> 07:00:41.820 align:start position:0%
Connector Road into Dairy from this new
 
07:00:43.910 --> 07:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
exit of I-93
 
07:00:48.530 --> 07:00:48.540 align:start position:0%
the entire project is now when when the
 
07:00:50.690 --> 07:00:50.700 align:start position:0%
towns of dairy and Londonderry approve
 
07:00:53.270 --> 07:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
this project it was in the 50 million
 
07:00:55.910 --> 07:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
range and when they paid in their
 
07:00:59.288 --> 07:00:59.298 align:start position:0%
portion that was what it was it is now a
 
07:01:02.810 --> 07:01:02.820 align:start position:0%
125 million dollar project and probably
 
07:01:04.610 --> 07:01:04.620 align:start position:0%
yesterday it grew something I don't know
 
07:01:07.910 --> 07:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
but it's a very expensive project and
 
07:01:11.030 --> 07:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
this is a little tiny part of it
 
07:01:14.170 --> 07:01:14.180 align:start position:0%
the place where this Crossing would be
 
07:01:17.510 --> 07:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
will whether it has a tunnel or not will
 
07:01:19.548 --> 07:01:19.558 align:start position:0%
have a surface Crossing because it's a
 
07:01:20.868 --> 07:01:20.878 align:start position:0%
place where there's an intersection
 
07:01:23.570 --> 07:01:23.580 align:start position:0%
between two roads that intersection has
 
07:01:26.030 --> 07:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
a traffic light the traffic light has a
 
07:01:28.250 --> 07:01:28.260 align:start position:0%
crosswalk with a signal with a button
 
07:01:30.830 --> 07:01:30.840 align:start position:0%
you pushed across
 
07:01:32.990 --> 07:01:33.000 align:start position:0%
um I personally think that alone is
 
07:01:37.850 --> 07:01:37.860 align:start position:0%
adequate but in addition to that dot is
 
07:01:40.548 --> 07:01:40.558 align:start position:0%
designed and is planning to build an
 
07:01:43.788 --> 07:01:43.798 align:start position:0%
alternative route that goes underneath a
 
07:01:45.650 --> 07:01:45.660 align:start position:0%
nearby Bridge
 
07:01:48.288 --> 07:01:48.298 align:start position:0%
you know but but the bottom line is our
 
07:01:51.288 --> 07:01:51.298 align:start position:0%
committee looked into this we visited it
 
07:01:53.570 --> 07:01:53.580 align:start position:0%
Etc and
 
07:01:55.810 --> 07:01:55.820 align:start position:0%
um we voted in our subcommittee
 
07:01:58.250 --> 07:01:58.260 align:start position:0%
unanimously and in the full finance
 
07:02:01.490 --> 07:02:01.500 align:start position:0%
committee 22-3
 
07:02:04.490 --> 07:02:04.500 align:start position:0%
um that that this is not rise to the
 
07:02:06.468 --> 07:02:06.478 align:start position:0%
level of needing funding
 
07:02:10.910 --> 07:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:12.830 --> 07:02:12.840 align:start position:0%
Sam gold has requested a division
 
07:02:49.250 --> 07:02:49.260 align:start position:0%

07:03:55.070 --> 07:03:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:57.048 --> 07:03:57.058 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is any speed to
 
07:03:59.628 --> 07:03:59.638 align:start position:0%
legislate in house bill 506. this is a
 
07:04:01.010 --> 07:04:01.020 align:start position:0%
division vote Sheriff recognize
 
07:04:02.510 --> 07:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
representative Gould for a parliamentary
 
07:04:02.520 --> 07:04:09.110 align:start position:0%
representative Gould for a parliamentary
inquiry

07:04:09.110 --> 07:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:12.530 --> 07:04:12.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker if I know that 506
 
07:04:15.830 --> 07:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
will not delay the exit 4A because there
 
07:04:17.448 --> 07:04:17.458 align:start position:0%
are many other reasons for it being
 
07:04:20.090 --> 07:04:20.100 align:start position:0%
delayed and if I know that this tunnel
 
07:04:21.948 --> 07:04:21.958 align:start position:0%
is the safest solution to the other side
 
07:04:24.890 --> 07:04:24.900 align:start position:0%
of six Lanes of traffic and if I know
 
07:04:27.770 --> 07:04:27.780 align:start position:0%
that the criminal penalty will be
 
07:04:31.490 --> 07:04:31.500 align:start position:0%
removed by amendments and if I know that
 
07:04:33.708 --> 07:04:33.718 align:start position:0%
this alternative shuts off the rail
 
07:04:36.708 --> 07:04:36.718 align:start position:0%
trail to our handicapped Community would
 
07:04:38.750 --> 07:04:38.760 align:start position:0%
I then press the red button to overturn
 
07:04:41.570 --> 07:04:41.580 align:start position:0%
the Ito so that another motion may be
 
07:04:44.270 --> 07:04:44.280 align:start position:0%
made thank you do you recognize
 
07:04:45.410 --> 07:04:45.420 align:start position:0%

07:04:53.868 --> 07:04:53.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:56.868 --> 07:04:56.878 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker if I know that this
 
07:05:00.110 --> 07:05:00.120 align:start position:0%
was well supported by the finance
 
07:05:01.850 --> 07:05:01.860 align:start position:0%
committee and if there was very
 
07:05:05.930 --> 07:05:05.940 align:start position:0%
confusing and contradicting testimony in
 
07:05:08.150 --> 07:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
the many hours that we spend on it we
 
07:05:10.610 --> 07:05:10.620 align:start position:0%
finally decided that it was best not to
 
07:05:13.190 --> 07:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
bring this forward and spend money that
 
07:05:14.510 --> 07:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
had already been
 
07:05:17.628 --> 07:05:17.638 align:start position:0%
put in the budget by the Two Towns but I
 
07:05:19.850 --> 07:05:19.860 align:start position:0%
now support the committee and press the

Mr Speaker
 
07:10:15.230 --> 07:10:15.240 align:start position:0%
if I know
 
07:10:17.330 --> 07:10:17.340 align:start position:0%
this bill as amended would create a new
 
07:10:19.750 --> 07:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
license to allow diving for lobsters but
 
07:10:22.610 --> 07:10:22.620 align:start position:0%
provides no funding to establish or
 
07:10:24.830 --> 07:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
administer that license providing an
 
07:10:28.250 --> 07:10:28.260 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate and Mr Speaker
 
07:10:31.128 --> 07:10:31.138 align:start position:0%
if I know New Hampshire
 
07:10:33.948 --> 07:10:33.958 align:start position:0%
does have a derelict fishing gear and
 
07:10:35.868 --> 07:10:35.878 align:start position:0%
Coastal cleanup fund
 
07:10:37.730 --> 07:10:37.740 align:start position:0%
and on April 8th
 
07:10:38.990 --> 07:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire fishing game in
 
07:10:41.868 --> 07:10:41.878 align:start position:0%
collaboration with commercial fishermen
 
07:10:45.110 --> 07:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:47.990 --> 07:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
but Mr Speaker if I know that this bill
 
07:10:51.770 --> 07:10:51.780 align:start position:0%
as amended cites the wrong rsas in the
 
07:10:54.170 --> 07:10:54.180 align:start position:0%
section regard regarding who should be
 
07:10:55.730 --> 07:10:55.740 align:start position:0%
keeping logs
 
07:10:58.850 --> 07:10:58.860 align:start position:0%
of locations of these traps it would not
 
07:11:02.990 --> 07:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
include lobster men to record those
 
07:11:05.690 --> 07:11:05.700 align:start position:0%
and Mr Speaker finally if I know these
 
07:11:05.700 --> 07:11:06.948 align:start position:0%
and Mr Speaker finally if I know these
are

07:11:06.948 --> 07:11:06.958 align:start position:0%
are
 
07:11:09.410 --> 07:11:09.420 align:start position:0%
just that there are a number of
 
07:11:13.910 --> 07:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
other flaws in this amendment
 
07:11:16.548 --> 07:11:16.558 align:start position:0%
and that we shouldn't rely on the Senate
 
07:11:19.250 --> 07:11:19.260 align:start position:0%
to fix those flaws for us
 
07:11:21.288 --> 07:11:21.298 align:start position:0%
and that this bill is not ready for
 
07:11:23.750 --> 07:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
prime time
 
07:11:26.030 --> 07:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
then Mr Speaker would I press the green
 
07:11:29.868 --> 07:11:29.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:31.670 --> 07:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
representative Roy's recognized for
 
07:11:34.310 --> 07:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry
 
07:11:37.190 --> 07:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I was
 
07:11:40.128 --> 07:11:40.138 align:start position:0%
if I know that I was originally inclined
 
07:11:42.650 --> 07:11:42.660 align:start position:0%
to support the table motion
 
07:11:46.190 --> 07:11:46.200 align:start position:0%
and if I further know that after that I
 
07:11:49.208 --> 07:11:49.218 align:start position:0%
saw evidence of
 
07:11:53.510 --> 07:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
tens of thousands of lobsters and other
 
07:11:56.270 --> 07:11:56.280 align:start position:0%
sea creatures dying of starvation
 
07:11:58.730 --> 07:11:58.740 align:start position:0%
and if you want to know why you're going
 
07:12:01.128 --> 07:12:01.138 align:start position:0%
to have to hear the bill then would I
 
07:12:03.410 --> 07:12:03.420 align:start position:0%
maybe hold off for just a few minutes
 
07:12:07.368 --> 07:12:07.378 align:start position:0%
and let's hear all about this bill
 
07:12:10.190 --> 07:12:10.200 align:start position:0%
and finally Mr Speaker if I know that I
 
07:12:12.048 --> 07:12:12.058 align:start position:0%
generally don't care about Lobster and
 
07:12:16.310 --> 07:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
luster and John butter but this
 
07:12:19.190 --> 07:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
even a front was an affront to my
 
07:12:22.010 --> 07:12:22.020 align:start position:0%
conscience I would want to vote to hold
 
07:12:23.810 --> 07:12:23.820 align:start position:0%
off on the table and hear the Bill thank
 
07:12:23.820 --> 07:12:27.110 align:start position:0%
off on the table and hear the Bill thank
you

07:12:27.110 --> 07:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:27.120 --> 07:12:30.770 align:start position:0%
 
is

07:12:30.770 --> 07:12:30.780 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:32.270 --> 07:12:32.280 align:start position:0%
the question is whether to lay House
 
07:12:35.390 --> 07:12:35.400 align:start position:0%
Bill 442 on the table this is a roll
 
07:12:37.788 --> 07:12:37.798 align:start position:0%
call vote if you're in favor press the
 
07:12:39.948 --> 07:12:39.958 align:start position:0%
green button if you're opposed press the
 
07:12:41.750 --> 07:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
red button voting stations are open for
 
07:12:46.730 --> 07:12:46.740 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:18.948 --> 07:13:18.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:34.250 --> 07:13:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:35.810 --> 07:13:35.820 align:start position:0%
of all members present had an
 
07:13:37.548 --> 07:13:37.558 align:start position:0%
opportunity to vote
 
07:13:40.548 --> 07:13:40.558 align:start position:0%
thou shall attendeth state of the vote
 
07:13:43.190 --> 07:13:43.200 align:start position:0%
131 on the affirmative 245 in the
 
07:13:48.410 --> 07:13:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:51.530 --> 07:13:51.540 align:start position:0%
the question now is on the
 
07:13:53.150 --> 07:13:53.160 align:start position:0%
committee Amendment
 
07:13:55.910 --> 07:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
zero seven zero nine H Princeton House
 
07:14:03.110 --> 07:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:05.208 --> 07:14:05.218 align:start position:0%
representative goalie is recognized
 
07:14:25.430 --> 07:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:27.530 --> 07:14:27.540 align:start position:0%
well I appreciate that members are
 
07:14:29.208 --> 07:14:29.218 align:start position:0%
taking their conversations to the answer
 
07:14:31.548 --> 07:14:31.558 align:start position:0%
room maybe start the conversations when
 
07:14:43.670 --> 07:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:45.350 --> 07:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker honorable
 
07:14:45.360 --> 07:14:46.548 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker honorable
colleagues

07:14:46.548 --> 07:14:46.558 align:start position:0%
colleagues
 
07:14:51.048 --> 07:14:51.058 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:53.270 --> 07:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
let me explain that
 
07:14:55.788 --> 07:14:55.798 align:start position:0%
when we come to our committees and do
 
07:14:57.590 --> 07:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
our committee work
 
07:15:00.590 --> 07:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate that especially when
 
07:15:02.330 --> 07:15:02.340 align:start position:0%
you only have one bill when you send
 
07:15:08.448 --> 07:15:08.458 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:10.548 --> 07:15:10.558 align:start position:0%
why am I here speaking against this
 
07:15:10.558 --> 07:15:13.128 align:start position:0%
why am I here speaking against this
amendment

07:15:13.128 --> 07:15:13.138 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:13.138 --> 07:15:14.750 align:start position:0%
 
because

07:15:14.750 --> 07:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
because
 
07:15:16.850 --> 07:15:16.860 align:start position:0%
there are a number of flaws that should
 
07:15:18.830 --> 07:15:18.840 align:start position:0%
have been fixed in committee before
 
07:15:21.170 --> 07:15:21.180 align:start position:0%
going to coming to this floor at least
 
07:15:24.890 --> 07:15:24.900 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:28.490 --> 07:15:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:31.730 --> 07:15:31.740 align:start position:0%
first of all as stated in my Pi this
 
07:15:34.190 --> 07:15:34.200 align:start position:0%
creates a new license with no funding
 
07:15:34.200 --> 07:15:36.110 align:start position:0%
creates a new license with no funding
source

07:15:36.110 --> 07:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
source
 
07:15:41.810 --> 07:15:41.820 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:44.628 --> 07:15:44.638 align:start position:0%
second of all
 
07:15:48.288 --> 07:15:48.298 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:50.448 --> 07:15:50.458 align:start position:0%
stating that the executive director
 
07:15:56.208 --> 07:15:56.218 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:00.530 --> 07:16:00.540 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:02.030 --> 07:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
scuba divers
 
07:16:04.850 --> 07:16:04.860 align:start position:0%
with a recreational license may Harvest
 
07:16:08.628 --> 07:16:08.638 align:start position:0%
lobsters during the established season
 
07:16:11.208 --> 07:16:11.218 align:start position:0%
but then it goes on to state
 
07:16:14.390 --> 07:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
all areas outside the zones shall be
 
07:16:17.030 --> 07:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
restricted to harvesting Lobsters by
 
07:16:22.128 --> 07:16:22.138 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:24.350 --> 07:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
so let me ask if it's restricted to just
 
07:16:25.548 --> 07:16:25.558 align:start position:0%
diverse where are the commercial
 
07:16:30.650 --> 07:16:30.660 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:32.448 --> 07:16:32.458 align:start position:0%
we were told
 
07:16:34.490 --> 07:16:34.500 align:start position:0%
that that shouldn't have been the
 
07:16:36.530 --> 07:16:36.540 align:start position:0%
language it should have been restricted
 
07:16:36.540 --> 07:16:39.230 align:start position:0%
language it should have been restricted
from

07:16:39.230 --> 07:16:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:40.548 --> 07:16:40.558 align:start position:0%
we should have fixed it in a committee
 
07:16:45.350 --> 07:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:48.830 --> 07:16:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:53.090 --> 07:16:53.100 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:55.250 --> 07:16:55.260 align:start position:0%
we use
 
07:16:58.730 --> 07:16:58.740 align:start position:0%
Town lines and Roads to Mark those
 
07:16:58.740 --> 07:17:02.750 align:start position:0%
Town lines and Roads to Mark those
boundaries

07:17:02.750 --> 07:17:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:05.930 --> 07:17:05.940 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:08.150 --> 07:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
there's no markers
 
07:17:10.190 --> 07:17:10.200 align:start position:0%
what are our Harbor markers but that's
 
07:17:11.810 --> 07:17:11.820 align:start position:0%
about it
 
07:17:14.150 --> 07:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
where is fishing game supposed to set up
 
07:17:16.070 --> 07:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
a Zone
 
07:17:18.110 --> 07:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
using GPS
 
07:17:19.730 --> 07:17:19.740 align:start position:0%
we were told divers can't use GPS
 
07:17:19.740 --> 07:17:23.390 align:start position:0%
we were told divers can't use GPS
underwater

07:17:23.390 --> 07:17:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:25.010 --> 07:17:25.020 align:start position:0%
there's no fence to stop them when they
 
07:17:28.250 --> 07:17:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:29.990 --> 07:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
how do you manage it how do you enforce
 
07:17:30.000 --> 07:17:34.190 align:start position:0%
how do you manage it how do you enforce
it

07:17:34.190 --> 07:17:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:39.110 --> 07:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:41.690 --> 07:17:41.700 align:start position:0%
these divers shall abide by the New
 
07:17:45.530 --> 07:17:45.540 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:48.650 --> 07:17:48.660 align:start position:0%
there is no guide
 
07:17:50.628 --> 07:17:50.638 align:start position:0%
this does there's no definition of what
 
07:17:53.150 --> 07:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
the guide is
 
07:18:00.890 --> 07:18:00.900 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:04.190 --> 07:18:04.200 align:start position:0%
this bill goes on to further state that
 
07:18:07.968 --> 07:18:07.978 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:10.430 --> 07:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
the location and tracking of
 
07:18:14.868 --> 07:18:14.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:16.430 --> 07:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
person who holds a license to take
 
07:18:21.410 --> 07:18:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:24.468 --> 07:18:24.478 align:start position:0%
those rsas have nothing to do with
 
07:18:27.590 --> 07:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
commercial Lobster licenses
 
07:18:29.628 --> 07:18:29.638 align:start position:0%
that was brought up during the exact
 
07:18:29.638 --> 07:18:31.548 align:start position:0%
that was brought up during the exact
session

07:18:31.548 --> 07:18:31.558 align:start position:0%
session
 
07:18:37.430 --> 07:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:39.468 --> 07:18:39.478 align:start position:0%
here it is still in the bill in the
 
07:18:39.478 --> 07:18:45.410 align:start position:0%
here it is still in the bill in the
amendment

07:18:45.410 --> 07:18:45.420 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:52.788 --> 07:18:52.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:56.570 --> 07:18:56.580 align:start position:0%
and this was a big deal for the fishing
 
07:18:59.330 --> 07:18:59.340 align:start position:0%
game as well as a commercial lobsterman
 
07:19:02.090 --> 07:19:02.100 align:start position:0%
it adds into the language for traps that
 
07:19:04.190 --> 07:19:04.200 align:start position:0%
are attached or retrievable no person
 
07:19:06.770 --> 07:19:06.780 align:start position:0%
except the owner and then adds or
 
07:19:11.990 --> 07:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:14.570 --> 07:19:14.580 align:start position:0%
so instead of the commercial lobsterman
 
07:19:17.030 --> 07:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
being responsible for his own traps this
 
07:19:19.788 --> 07:19:19.798 align:start position:0%
now opens the door to say he can allow
 
07:19:22.730 --> 07:19:22.740 align:start position:0%
anybody out there licensed or unlicensed
 
07:19:24.830 --> 07:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
to retrieve his traps because he
 
07:19:27.048 --> 07:19:27.058 align:start position:0%
authorized them to
 
07:19:29.090 --> 07:19:29.100 align:start position:0%
that's not right that gets strong
 
07:19:32.930 --> 07:19:32.940 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:34.548 --> 07:19:34.558 align:start position:0%
we were told well that shouldn't have
 
07:19:35.570 --> 07:19:35.580 align:start position:0%
been in there
 
07:19:41.690 --> 07:19:41.700 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:45.410 --> 07:19:45.420 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:47.628 --> 07:19:47.638 align:start position:0%
the final line of this is
 
07:19:52.250 --> 07:19:52.260 align:start position:0%
shall take effect 60 days upon Passage
 
07:19:53.690 --> 07:19:53.700 align:start position:0%
now those of you who have been here long
 
07:19:53.700 --> 07:19:54.770 align:start position:0%
now those of you who have been here long
enough

07:19:54.770 --> 07:19:54.780 align:start position:0%
enough
 
07:19:54.780 --> 07:19:56.690 align:start position:0%
enough
no

07:19:56.690 --> 07:19:56.700 align:start position:0%
no
 
07:19:59.330 --> 07:19:59.340 align:start position:0%
it is almost impossible
 
07:20:01.368 --> 07:20:01.378 align:start position:0%
to set up rules and get it through gel
 
07:20:03.590 --> 07:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
car and set up a whole new program that
 
07:20:12.230 --> 07:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:14.810 --> 07:20:14.820 align:start position:0%
so I stand here today and ask you the
 
07:20:19.430 --> 07:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:20.930 --> 07:20:20.940 align:start position:0%
stopping the federal government from
 
07:20:23.150 --> 07:20:23.160 align:start position:0%
enacting stricter regulations on our
 
07:20:23.160 --> 07:20:25.368 align:start position:0%
enacting stricter regulations on our
industry

07:20:25.368 --> 07:20:25.378 align:start position:0%
industry
 
07:20:30.890 --> 07:20:30.900 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:33.468 --> 07:20:33.478 align:start position:0%
that increases more mandates on this
 
07:20:39.948 --> 07:20:39.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:43.010 --> 07:20:43.020 align:start position:0%
so I ask you to vote down this amendment
 
07:20:44.448 --> 07:20:44.458 align:start position:0%
I was hoping we could have tabled it so
 
07:20:45.770 --> 07:20:45.780 align:start position:0%
that a better bill could have been
 
07:20:47.930 --> 07:20:47.940 align:start position:0%
brought back next year
 
07:20:49.730 --> 07:20:49.740 align:start position:0%
fixing these problems and we wouldn't be
 
07:20:52.310 --> 07:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
sending this across the way hoping that
 
07:20:55.730 --> 07:20:55.740 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:58.548 --> 07:20:58.558 align:start position:0%
so I'm asking you to vote against the
 
07:20:58.558 --> 07:21:01.910 align:start position:0%
so I'm asking you to vote against the
amendment

07:21:01.910 --> 07:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:04.968 --> 07:21:04.978 align:start position:0%
do the right thing and
 
07:21:07.430 --> 07:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:21:10.190 --> 07:21:10.200 align:start position:0%
does a member yield for a question
 
07:21:13.190 --> 07:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
remember does not yield
 
07:21:15.170 --> 07:21:15.180 align:start position:0%
representative Spillane is recognized
 
07:21:18.830 --> 07:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:21.110 --> 07:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
07:21:23.990 --> 07:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
members the original bill was filed at
 
07:21:25.788 --> 07:21:25.798 align:start position:0%
the request of a group of lobstermen to
 
07:21:27.350 --> 07:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
offer some protection from the proposed
 
07:21:29.270 --> 07:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
Federal rules dealing with the right
 
07:21:31.730 --> 07:21:31.740 align:start position:0%
whales and interaction with lobster gear
 
07:21:33.590 --> 07:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
and those rules were set aside by the
 
07:21:34.968 --> 07:21:34.978 align:start position:0%
federal government for an additional six
 
07:21:37.910 --> 07:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
years making that part of the bill move
 
07:21:39.948 --> 07:21:39.958 align:start position:0%
the amendment removed the unnecessary
 
07:21:42.288 --> 07:21:42.298 align:start position:0%
wording but kept the second part of the
 
07:21:44.090 --> 07:21:44.100 align:start position:0%
original Bill dealing with the sport of
 
07:21:46.548 --> 07:21:46.558 align:start position:0%
hunting for lobsters bare-handed while
 
07:21:49.730 --> 07:21:49.740 align:start position:0%
using scuba equipment and free diving
 
07:21:52.250 --> 07:21:52.260 align:start position:0%
that part of the legislation has easily
 
07:21:54.650 --> 07:21:54.660 align:start position:0%
passed in this body the last three times
 
07:21:57.708 --> 07:21:57.718 align:start position:0%
it appeared once on a Voice vote
 
07:21:59.990 --> 07:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
the amendment does not create a
 
07:22:02.390 --> 07:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
free-for-all of lobster dive of divers
 
07:22:05.448 --> 07:22:05.458 align:start position:0%
taking Lobster but it allocates a mere
 
07:22:08.570 --> 07:22:08.580 align:start position:0%
100 licenses annually
 
07:22:10.070 --> 07:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
which a diver
 
07:22:12.770 --> 07:22:12.780 align:start position:0%
using that license may take up to three
 
07:22:14.510 --> 07:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
lobsters a day
 
07:22:16.190 --> 07:22:16.200 align:start position:0%
for a season
 
07:22:18.650 --> 07:22:18.660 align:start position:0%
that will only be about four weeks long
 
07:22:20.810 --> 07:22:20.820 align:start position:0%
to begin
 
07:22:23.330 --> 07:22:23.340 align:start position:0%
the amendment also addresses a serious
 
07:22:25.128 --> 07:22:25.138 align:start position:0%
environmental situation that many states
 
07:22:27.708 --> 07:22:27.718 align:start position:0%
and countries are now just recognizing
 
07:22:30.048 --> 07:22:30.058 align:start position:0%
the Connecticut legislature passed a
 
07:22:31.910 --> 07:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
similar legislation just prior to covid
 
07:22:34.070 --> 07:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
so you can see we are years late coming
 
07:22:35.628 --> 07:22:35.638 align:start position:0%
to the game
 
07:22:37.610 --> 07:22:37.620 align:start position:0%
this environmental situation has to do
 
07:22:39.948 --> 07:22:39.958 align:start position:0%
with the loss of underwater of modern
 
07:22:43.310 --> 07:22:43.320 align:start position:0%
steel and plastic lobster traps lobster
 
07:22:45.530 --> 07:22:45.540 align:start position:0%
traps are no longer things of wood and
 
07:22:47.810 --> 07:22:47.820 align:start position:0%
string which degrades relatively quickly
 
07:22:49.368 --> 07:22:49.378 align:start position:0%
in the ocean
 
07:22:51.468 --> 07:22:51.478 align:start position:0%
the committee heard testimony from the
 
07:22:53.628 --> 07:22:53.638 align:start position:0%
owner of a Maine not-for-profit company
 
07:22:57.350 --> 07:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
that specializes in locating identifying
 
07:22:59.868 --> 07:22:59.878 align:start position:0%
removing and recycling
 
07:23:02.090 --> 07:23:02.100 align:start position:0%
what are referred to as derelict or
 
07:23:04.850 --> 07:23:04.860 align:start position:0%
ghost traps from the bottom of the
 
07:23:07.010 --> 07:23:07.020 align:start position:0%
coastal Waters in Maine
 
07:23:08.810 --> 07:23:08.820 align:start position:0%
while this company has successfully
 
07:23:11.628 --> 07:23:11.638 align:start position:0%
removed thousands of these traps already
 
07:23:14.150 --> 07:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
the estimates are that an additional 3
 
07:23:17.868 --> 07:23:17.878 align:start position:0%
million traps remain in Maine Waters
 
07:23:20.150 --> 07:23:20.160 align:start position:0%
imagine for a moment if we learned that
 
07:23:23.330 --> 07:23:23.340 align:start position:0%
3 million shopping carts were abandoned
 
07:23:25.368 --> 07:23:25.378 align:start position:0%
throughout the White Mountains
 
07:23:28.310 --> 07:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
how much of an outcry would there be
 
07:23:30.288 --> 07:23:30.298 align:start position:0%
but the traps are Underwater All Along
 
07:23:34.010 --> 07:23:34.020 align:start position:0%
our Shoreline unseen by most people
 
07:23:35.810 --> 07:23:35.820 align:start position:0%
but there's still a contamination and
 
07:23:38.030 --> 07:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
they deserve our immediate attention
 
07:23:40.250 --> 07:23:40.260 align:start position:0%
while we in New Hampshire
 
07:23:42.530 --> 07:23:42.540 align:start position:0%
have much less Coastline than adjacent
 
07:23:44.570 --> 07:23:44.580 align:start position:0%
States the problem of the abundance of
 
07:23:46.670 --> 07:23:46.680 align:start position:0%
ghost traps in our Coastal Waters is
 
07:23:49.250 --> 07:23:49.260 align:start position:0%
stunning a member has placed a photo
 
07:23:51.590 --> 07:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
album on the table in the anterum
 
07:23:54.468 --> 07:23:54.478 align:start position:0%
to show what a single diver with a
 
07:23:56.810 --> 07:23:56.820 align:start position:0%
30-minute dive at the mouth of the
 
07:23:59.690 --> 07:23:59.700 align:start position:0%
piscataqua river encountered and
 
07:23:59.700 --> 07:24:01.190 align:start position:0%
piscataqua river encountered and
documented

07:24:01.190 --> 07:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
documented
 
07:24:03.410 --> 07:24:03.420 align:start position:0%
this was done in the week prior to the
 
07:24:04.788 --> 07:24:04.798 align:start position:0%
Committee hearing
 
07:24:07.368 --> 07:24:07.378 align:start position:0%
not too long ago and I hope you have had
 
07:24:08.990 --> 07:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
a chance to look at it
 
07:24:11.510 --> 07:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
in addition to the polluting aspect of
 
07:24:14.330 --> 07:24:14.340 align:start position:0%
PVC coated steel traps lost on our
 
07:24:16.610 --> 07:24:16.620 align:start position:0%
Coastline two-thirds of all these ghost
 
07:24:20.390 --> 07:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
traps purportedly contain live animals
 
07:24:22.070 --> 07:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
you'll see in the pictures that are back
 
07:24:24.708 --> 07:24:24.718 align:start position:0%
there that one has a large cod fish
 
07:24:27.530 --> 07:24:27.540 align:start position:0%
stock and another one has a lobster
 
07:24:31.368 --> 07:24:31.378 align:start position:0%
due to our existing laws no person may
 
07:24:33.350 --> 07:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
touch the lobster trap aside from the
 
07:24:33.360 --> 07:24:34.670 align:start position:0%
touch the lobster trap aside from the
owner

07:24:34.670 --> 07:24:34.680 align:start position:0%
owner
 
07:24:37.610 --> 07:24:37.620 align:start position:0%
and that is the law even if the Trap Is
 
07:24:37.620 --> 07:24:39.350 align:start position:0%
and that is the law even if the Trap Is
Lost

07:24:39.350 --> 07:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
Lost
 
07:24:41.150 --> 07:24:41.160 align:start position:0%
the animals caught in these abandoned
 
07:24:42.890 --> 07:24:42.900 align:start position:0%
traps will eventually die a slow death
 
07:24:44.270 --> 07:24:44.280 align:start position:0%
of starvation
 
07:24:46.850 --> 07:24:46.860 align:start position:0%
even if a scuba diver discovers the
 
07:24:48.110 --> 07:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
abandoned trap
 
07:24:50.030 --> 07:24:50.040 align:start position:0%
because it's illegal for the scuba diver
 
07:24:52.128 --> 07:24:52.138 align:start position:0%
to touch the trap in any way to release
 
07:24:54.170 --> 07:24:54.180 align:start position:0%
the animal
 
07:24:56.150 --> 07:24:56.160 align:start position:0%
this amendment allows divers who come
 
07:24:58.070 --> 07:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
upon gear that is unable to be hauled to
 
07:24:59.690 --> 07:24:59.700 align:start position:0%
the surface in its present form to
 
07:25:02.690 --> 07:25:02.700 align:start position:0%
legally release the animals
 
07:25:04.548 --> 07:25:04.558 align:start position:0%
while at the same time asks them to
 
07:25:07.548 --> 07:25:07.558 align:start position:0%
record the location for fish and game
 
07:25:10.010 --> 07:25:10.020 align:start position:0%
both of these parts to the amendment are
 
07:25:12.110 --> 07:25:12.120 align:start position:0%
important because biologists testifying
 
07:25:14.090 --> 07:25:14.100 align:start position:0%
said that when the trapped animal dies
 
07:25:16.850 --> 07:25:16.860 align:start position:0%
the carcass becomes new bait attracting
 
07:25:19.968 --> 07:25:19.978 align:start position:0%
new victims and the cycle continues over
 
07:25:22.730 --> 07:25:22.740 align:start position:0%
and over
 
07:25:25.310 --> 07:25:25.320 align:start position:0%
the committee heard statistics that
 
07:25:27.048 --> 07:25:27.058 align:start position:0%
commercial lobstermen lose 10 percent of
 
07:25:28.368 --> 07:25:28.378 align:start position:0%
their traps annually
 
07:25:30.288 --> 07:25:30.298 align:start position:0%
that figure was disputed by
 
07:25:31.670 --> 07:25:31.680 align:start position:0%
representatives of the lobster and
 
07:25:34.310 --> 07:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
Commercial industry but the 10 figure is
 
07:25:36.410 --> 07:25:36.420 align:start position:0%
generally accepted and backed up in
 
07:25:38.030 --> 07:25:38.040 align:start position:0%
every study I've read including those
 
07:25:40.190 --> 07:25:40.200 align:start position:0%
done by our federal government
 
07:25:41.690 --> 07:25:41.700 align:start position:0%

location of as many of these traps
 
07:26:50.270 --> 07:26:50.280 align:start position:0%
and then require the reporting of the
 
07:26:52.850 --> 07:26:52.860 align:start position:0%
location in a timely fashion to begin
 
07:26:54.650 --> 07:26:54.660 align:start position:0%
building a database from which we can

07:27:13.850 --> 07:27:13.860 align:start position:0%
question would you believe that since we
 
07:27:17.570 --> 07:27:17.580 align:start position:0%
heard previously that the rsas that were
 
07:27:19.368 --> 07:27:19.378 align:start position:0%
referenced were the incorrect rsas and
 
07:27:22.190 --> 07:27:22.200 align:start position:0%
were not commercial uh licenses that I
 
07:27:23.930 --> 07:27:23.940 align:start position:0%
had OLS double checked their work for me
 
07:27:25.490 --> 07:27:25.500 align:start position:0%
and they just sent me an email and I'm
 
07:27:27.590 --> 07:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
happy to share it with the house that
 
07:27:30.350 --> 07:27:30.360 align:start position:0%
shows every single one of those rsas
 
07:27:32.090 --> 07:27:32.100 align:start position:0%
references non-commercial software
 
07:27:33.910 --> 07:27:33.920 align:start position:0%
license non-resident wholesaler license
 
07:27:35.628 --> 07:27:35.638 align:start position:0%
non-resident commercial saltwater
 
07:27:37.250 --> 07:27:37.260 align:start position:0%
license and Resident wholesaler license
 
07:27:40.250 --> 07:27:40.260 align:start position:0%
that they are all the correct rsas
 
07:27:44.628 --> 07:27:44.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:27:45.770 --> 07:27:45.780 align:start position:0%
I do
 
07:27:47.150 --> 07:27:47.160 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington you may
 
07:27:47.160 --> 07:27:48.350 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington you may
inquire

07:27:48.350 --> 07:27:48.360 align:start position:0%
inquire
 
07:27:49.850 --> 07:27:49.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker and thank you for
 
07:27:51.410 --> 07:27:51.420 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative there
 
07:27:52.670 --> 07:27:52.680 align:start position:0%
seemed to be a lot of discussion about
 
07:27:54.350 --> 07:27:54.360 align:start position:0%
whether fish in the aim could implement
 
07:27:56.510 --> 07:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
this or Implement that but isn't it true
 
07:27:59.030 --> 07:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
that every state from Massachusetts to
 
07:28:01.430 --> 07:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
Florida has allowed scuba diving by
 
07:28:04.850 --> 07:28:04.860 align:start position:0%
licenses by scuba diving to take
 
07:28:07.190 --> 07:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
lobsters and that I'm sure our fish and
 
07:28:08.690 --> 07:28:08.700 align:start position:0%
game department is as capable of the
 
07:28:10.190 --> 07:28:10.200 align:start position:0%
zozoic come up with the appropriate
 
07:28:10.200 --> 07:28:12.410 align:start position:0%
zozoic come up with the appropriate
regulations

07:28:12.410 --> 07:28:12.420 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
07:28:14.150 --> 07:28:14.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:28:17.750 --> 07:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
that is true uh we actually had some
 
07:28:19.850 --> 07:28:19.860 align:start position:0%
testimony in committee from fish and
 
07:28:23.330 --> 07:28:23.340 align:start position:0%
game uh disputing or challenging the the
 
07:28:25.250 --> 07:28:25.260 align:start position:0%
figure that every state along the
 
07:28:26.810 --> 07:28:26.820 align:start position:0%
Eastern Seaboard with the exception of
 
07:28:28.190 --> 07:28:28.200 align:start position:0%
Maine and New Hampshire currently allows
 
07:28:31.430 --> 07:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
scuba diving for lobsters so I actually
 
07:28:33.288 --> 07:28:33.298 align:start position:0%
personally contacted mass in Rhode
 
07:28:33.298 --> 07:28:34.670 align:start position:0%
personally contacted mass in Rhode
Island

07:28:34.670 --> 07:28:34.680 align:start position:0%
Island
 
07:28:37.010 --> 07:28:37.020 align:start position:0%
um they both do and we have also
 
07:28:39.530 --> 07:28:39.540 align:start position:0%
investigated the the game laws and fish
 
07:28:42.170 --> 07:28:42.180 align:start position:0%
laws all the way down the Seacoast and
 
07:28:43.730 --> 07:28:43.740 align:start position:0%
every single one of them allows diving
 
07:28:46.368 --> 07:28:46.378 align:start position:0%
for lobsters however about the Carolinas
 
07:28:48.468 --> 07:28:48.478 align:start position:0%
it changes from the main lobster to the
 
07:28:50.510 --> 07:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
spiny Lobster so whether you want to
 
07:28:52.250 --> 07:28:52.260 align:start position:0%
count scuba diving for spiny Lobster
 
07:28:54.530 --> 07:28:54.540 align:start position:0%
instead of Maine Lobsters up to you
 
07:28:57.830 --> 07:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
does a member yield for another question
 
07:29:00.350 --> 07:29:00.360 align:start position:0%
representative Cahill you may inquire
 
07:29:02.090 --> 07:29:02.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr speaker thank you for
 
07:29:04.430 --> 07:29:04.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question would you believe
 
07:29:07.850 --> 07:29:07.860 align:start position:0%
that the ghost lobster traps also pose a
 
07:29:10.788 --> 07:29:10.798 align:start position:0%
threat to swimmers and Surfers and I
 
07:29:13.250 --> 07:29:13.260 align:start position:0%
once had to cut free a surfer whose foot
 
07:29:19.670 --> 07:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:29:21.468 --> 07:29:21.478 align:start position:0%
yes I would believe that because the
 
07:29:22.968 --> 07:29:22.978 align:start position:0%
storms tend to put these things wherever
 
07:29:25.128 --> 07:29:25.138 align:start position:0%
they feel like it and we've seen actual
 
07:29:27.170 --> 07:29:27.180 align:start position:0%
balls of these traps as they entangle
 
07:29:29.090 --> 07:29:29.100 align:start position:0%
one another and become giant mountains
 
07:29:34.010 --> 07:29:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
07:29:36.110 --> 07:29:36.120 align:start position:0%
representative Jan Vernon has recognized
 
07:29:41.868 --> 07:29:41.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:29:43.730 --> 07:29:43.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
07:29:45.650 --> 07:29:45.660 align:start position:0%
it should come as no surprise with the
 
07:29:47.390 --> 07:29:47.400 align:start position:0%
name of Jameson and come from Seabrook
 
07:29:48.830 --> 07:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
and representing Seabrook and Hampton
 
07:29:50.990 --> 07:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
I'd be against the amendment
 
07:29:53.150 --> 07:29:53.160 align:start position:0%
but you also notice if you look at the
 
07:29:55.128 --> 07:29:55.138 align:start position:0%
original bill that I was a co-sponsor of
 
07:29:57.230 --> 07:29:57.240 align:start position:0%
the bill so it's very unusual for me to
 
07:29:58.670 --> 07:29:58.680 align:start position:0%
be against an amendment wouldn't you
 
07:29:58.680 --> 07:29:59.810 align:start position:0%
be against an amendment wouldn't you
think

07:29:59.810 --> 07:29:59.820 align:start position:0%
think
 
07:30:01.490 --> 07:30:01.500 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you why I'm against the
 
07:30:01.500 --> 07:30:02.690 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you why I'm against the
amendment

07:30:02.690 --> 07:30:02.700 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
07:30:06.048 --> 07:30:06.058 align:start position:0%
the bill was it was introduced was to
 
07:30:08.330 --> 07:30:08.340 align:start position:0%
reduce government interference and
 
07:30:10.670 --> 07:30:10.680 align:start position:0%
government regulation on a very very
 
07:30:13.730 --> 07:30:13.740 align:start position:0%
regulated industry an industry which my
 
07:30:17.270 --> 07:30:17.280 align:start position:0%
town was founded upon fishermen
 
07:30:19.850 --> 07:30:19.860 align:start position:0%
and it was a way to protect them from
 
07:30:22.310 --> 07:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
government overreach this amendment
 
07:30:23.868 --> 07:30:23.878 align:start position:0%
takes away that
 
07:30:28.070 --> 07:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
and adds more re requirements of the
 
07:30:28.080 --> 07:30:29.150 align:start position:0%
and adds more re requirements of the
fishermen

07:30:29.150 --> 07:30:29.160 align:start position:0%
fishermen
 
07:30:30.788 --> 07:30:30.798 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that is very very
 
07:30:33.468 --> 07:30:33.478 align:start position:0%
perplexing to me is that it would
 
07:30:35.690 --> 07:30:35.700 align:start position:0%
require a lobsterman to keep a written
 
07:30:38.628 --> 07:30:38.638 align:start position:0%
record of where his traps are
 
07:30:40.368 --> 07:30:40.378 align:start position:0%
oh you know what I've been on a remote
 
07:30:42.468 --> 07:30:42.478 align:start position:0%
I've thrown Lobster pots over the side
 
07:30:46.128 --> 07:30:46.138 align:start position:0%
and I also hit my button on my GPS that
 
07:30:48.530 --> 07:30:48.540 align:start position:0%
told me where I dropped it but you know
 
07:30:50.270 --> 07:30:50.280 align:start position:0%
what the currents and Tides move those
 
07:30:52.610 --> 07:30:52.620 align:start position:0%
traps over time but at least I had an
 
07:30:54.288 --> 07:30:54.298 align:start position:0%
electronic record with it to where to
 
07:30:56.930 --> 07:30:56.940 align:start position:0%
start looking for that buoy bobbin
 
07:30:59.690 --> 07:30:59.700 align:start position:0%
but if I had to go back to the port
 
07:31:01.610 --> 07:31:01.620 align:start position:0%
and download every one of those
 
07:31:04.250 --> 07:31:04.260 align:start position:0%
Geographic locations and put it onto a
 
07:31:07.850 --> 07:31:07.860 align:start position:0%
written log that's kind of silly
 
07:31:10.788 --> 07:31:10.798 align:start position:0%
I also had the honor of serving as a
 
07:31:12.410 --> 07:31:12.420 align:start position:0%
member of this house
 
07:31:14.628 --> 07:31:14.638 align:start position:0%
in a commission called the commission
 
07:31:17.090 --> 07:31:17.100 align:start position:0%
the Coastal Marine natural resources and
 
07:31:19.430 --> 07:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
environment Commission and I'll tell you
 
07:31:21.410 --> 07:31:21.420 align:start position:0%
the makeup of that commission there are
 
07:31:24.590 --> 07:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
two senators and three one two three
 
07:31:26.628 --> 07:31:26.638 align:start position:0%
four five representatives of this house
 
07:31:28.730 --> 07:31:28.740 align:start position:0%
on that commission along with New
 
07:31:31.448 --> 07:31:31.458 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Des Fish and Game
 
07:31:34.610 --> 07:31:34.620 align:start position:0%
UNH Cooperative Extension New Hampshire
 
07:31:36.430 --> 07:31:36.440 align:start position:0%
nature conservancy
 
07:31:39.230 --> 07:31:39.240 align:start position:0%
environmental scientists from unh
 
07:31:41.030 --> 07:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
yes they have a commercial fisherman
 
07:31:43.250 --> 07:31:43.260 align:start position:0%
also represented there and two
 
07:31:46.250 --> 07:31:46.260 align:start position:0%
aquaculture industry experts and our
 
07:31:46.260 --> 07:31:47.330 align:start position:0%
aquaculture industry experts and our
favorite

07:31:47.330 --> 07:31:47.340 align:start position:0%
favorite
 
07:31:50.510 --> 07:31:50.520 align:start position:0%
state agency called dread
 
07:31:53.448 --> 07:31:53.458 align:start position:0%
it's very very interesting that that
 
07:31:55.610 --> 07:31:55.620 align:start position:0%
commission never came to this body with
 
07:31:59.030 --> 07:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
a recommendation to further restrict
 
07:32:01.368 --> 07:32:01.378 align:start position:0%
the lobster industry
 
07:32:03.170 --> 07:32:03.180 align:start position:0%
for uh for
 
07:32:04.910 --> 07:32:04.920 align:start position:0%
the people that want this amendment to
 
07:32:07.850 --> 07:32:07.860 align:start position:0%
say that uh a lobsterman doesn't care
 
07:32:10.070 --> 07:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
about his traps being lost guess what
 
07:32:11.750 --> 07:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
that's an investment that he's lost in
 
07:32:11.760 --> 07:32:13.070 align:start position:0%
that's an investment that he's lost in
investment

07:32:13.070 --> 07:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
investment
 
07:32:16.250 --> 07:32:16.260 align:start position:0%
one two if he throws another Lobster Pot
 
07:32:18.708 --> 07:32:18.718 align:start position:0%
a string of lobster pots over top of
 
07:32:21.410 --> 07:32:21.420 align:start position:0%
that derelict gear they get entangled
 
07:32:23.510 --> 07:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
and guess what now he's out two Lobster
 
07:32:26.030 --> 07:32:26.040 align:start position:0%
pots for them to say that a lobsterman
 
07:32:28.310 --> 07:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't care about his derelict traps is
 
07:32:31.190 --> 07:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
bunk so I'd ask you to defeat the
 
07:32:33.230 --> 07:32:33.240 align:start position:0%
amendment so we can move on to the main
 
07:32:36.288 --> 07:32:36.298 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you Mr Speaker
 
07:32:38.270 --> 07:32:38.280 align:start position:0%
representative wheelers recognized speak
 
07:32:42.048 --> 07:32:42.058 align:start position:0%
 
07:32:44.570 --> 07:32:44.580 align:start position:0%
that's right representative that's right
 
07:32:46.368 --> 07:32:46.378 align:start position:0%
my friend from Deerfield that is the
 
07:32:47.690 --> 07:32:47.700 align:start position:0%
lobsters that we're here fighting for
 
07:32:49.490 --> 07:32:49.500 align:start position:0%
and I think the imagery that
 
07:32:51.468 --> 07:32:51.478 align:start position:0%
representative Spillane gave us of
 
07:32:53.930 --> 07:32:53.940 align:start position:0%
millions of shopping carts scattered in
 
07:32:56.390 --> 07:32:56.400 align:start position:0%
the White Mountains aptly describes the
 
07:32:58.548 --> 07:32:58.558 align:start position:0%
situation that we are in our oceans
 
07:33:00.770 --> 07:33:00.780 align:start position:0%
after Decades of the lobster industry
 
07:33:02.810 --> 07:33:02.820 align:start position:0%
being able to dump these steel cages
 
07:33:05.750 --> 07:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
into the ecosystem of our oceans sit
 
07:33:08.930 --> 07:33:08.940 align:start position:0%
littered legislating is about finding
 
07:33:11.208 --> 07:33:11.218 align:start position:0%
balance between interests and as you
 
07:33:13.250 --> 07:33:13.260 align:start position:0%
vote on this amendment I asked you to
 
07:33:15.830 --> 07:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
ask yourself whether a lobster fishing
 
07:33:17.930 --> 07:33:17.940 align:start position:0%
corporation's bottom line is more
 
07:33:20.330 --> 07:33:20.340 align:start position:0%
important than the fish getting stuck in
 
07:33:22.730 --> 07:33:22.740 align:start position:0%
these cages all throughout our Waters
 
07:33:26.330 --> 07:33:26.340 align:start position:0%
for me that answer is clear our oceans
 
07:33:27.708 --> 07:33:27.718 align:start position:0%
are more important than the bottom line
 
07:33:31.250 --> 07:33:31.260 align:start position:0%
our fish our sea life and our ecosystems
 
07:33:33.048 --> 07:33:33.058 align:start position:0%
are more important important than the
 
07:33:35.750 --> 07:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
bottom line of an industry
 
07:33:37.310 --> 07:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
we can't Proclaim to be
 
07:33:39.230 --> 07:33:39.240 align:start position:0%
environmentalists while supporting

07:36:54.288 --> 07:36:54.298 align:start position:0%
that the establishment of this license

07:37:02.030 --> 07:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
and Mr Speaker if I know
 
07:37:04.730 --> 07:37:04.740 align:start position:0%
we all agree our oceans need to be

but this bill
 
07:37:10.610 --> 07:37:10.620 align:start position:0%
doesn't do that
 
07:37:12.230 --> 07:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
and Mr Speaker
 
07:37:14.628 --> 07:37:14.638 align:start position:0%
it falls short of that I should say
 
07:37:16.190 --> 07:37:16.200 align:start position:0%
hey Mr Speaker
 
07:37:18.830 --> 07:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
if I know
 
07:37:21.890 --> 07:37:21.900 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire does have
 
07:37:25.850 --> 07:37:25.860 align:start position:0%
a derelict gear fund
 
07:37:29.390 --> 07:37:29.400 align:start position:0%
and that the commercial fishermen do do

07:37:42.830 --> 07:37:42.840 align:start position:0%
that fishing game testified that there
 
07:37:44.750 --> 07:37:44.760 align:start position:0%
are a number of areas in this piece of

thank you Mr Speaker
 
07:38:19.548 --> 07:38:19.558 align:start position:0%
if I know that at 30 percent
 
07:38:22.070 --> 07:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
fishing industry is the leading source
 
07:38:23.930 --> 07:38:23.940 align:start position:0%
of trash for the ocean
 
07:38:25.788 --> 07:38:25.798 align:start position:0%
and further if I know that this
 
07:38:27.650 --> 07:38:27.660 align:start position:0%
amendment would use proceeds from
 
07:38:30.170 --> 07:38:30.180 align:start position:0%
selling licenses for divers to go
 
07:38:33.288 --> 07:38:33.298 align:start position:0%
lobstering and use those proceeds to do
 
07:38:36.650 --> 07:38:36.660 align:start position:0%
Coastal cleanup efforts and further if I
 
07:38:39.110 --> 07:38:39.120 align:start position:0%
know that this this law would allow Good

07:38:44.628 --> 07:38:44.638 align:start position:0%

Hampshire despite its Live Free or Die
 
07:38:54.770 --> 07:38:54.780 align:start position:0%

Press
 
07:45:19.070 --> 07:45:19.080 align:start position:0%
hospitals would then be further harmed
 
07:45:20.930 --> 07:45:20.940 align:start position:0%
by this policy and would potentially
 
07:45:22.810 --> 07:45:22.820 align:start position:0%
need to pay back Services
 
07:45:25.610 --> 07:45:25.620 align:start position:0%
Institute a reduction in force I.E
 
07:45:27.468 --> 07:45:27.478 align:start position:0%
firing people
 
07:45:29.868 --> 07:45:29.878 align:start position:0%
we're ultimately closed this would
 
07:45:32.330 --> 07:45:32.340 align:start position:0%
negatively impact local employment and
 
07:45:34.430 --> 07:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
impede patient access to pay to timely

acute care facilities 26 or 13 of these
 
07:45:41.990 --> 07:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
are what they call critical access
 
07:45:43.430 --> 07:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
hospitals some of the very small
 
07:45:46.070 --> 07:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
Community Hospitals
 
07:45:47.930 --> 07:45:47.940 align:start position:0%
all these hospitals would be harmed by
 
07:45:49.810 --> 07:45:49.820 align:start position:0%
this policy if the same day surgeries
 
07:45:52.750 --> 07:45:52.760 align:start position:0%
laboratory tests studies like MRIs
 
07:45:57.048 --> 07:45:57.058 align:start position:0%
x-rays CAT scans we're continued
 
07:45:59.150 --> 07:45:59.160 align:start position:0%
from their day-to-day operations and
 
07:46:00.890 --> 07:46:00.900 align:start position:0%
performed by those direct payment
 
07:46:04.010 --> 07:46:04.020 align:start position:0%
facilities who only provide richly
 
07:46:06.468 --> 07:46:06.478 align:start position:0%
reimbursed services for those with
 
07:46:09.288 --> 07:46:09.298 align:start position:0%
resources to pay for them
 
07:46:11.208 --> 07:46:11.218 align:start position:0%
it would create a two-tiered Healthcare
 
07:46:13.910 --> 07:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
System placing an undue burden on the
 
07:46:16.010 --> 07:46:16.020 align:start position:0%
Community Hospitals that attempt to
 
07:46:18.948 --> 07:46:18.958 align:start position:0%
maintain needed and much much broader
 
07:46:20.708 --> 07:46:20.718 align:start position:0%
service lines for their communities
 
07:46:24.230 --> 07:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
hospitals must accept patients as
 
07:46:26.150 --> 07:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
required by their licensing regardless
 
07:46:28.490 --> 07:46:28.500 align:start position:0%
of the patient's insurance coverage or
 
07:46:30.110 --> 07:46:30.120 align:start position:0%
ability to pay
 
07:46:32.030 --> 07:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
if this bill were to pass our local
 
07:46:33.650 --> 07:46:33.660 align:start position:0%
Community Hospitals would be left to
 
07:46:36.048 --> 07:46:36.058 align:start position:0%
provide all the well less reimburse
 
07:46:38.390 --> 07:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
Services while still maintaining a
 
07:46:42.350 --> 07:46:42.360 align:start position:0%
comprehensive 20 24 7 care to all
 
07:46:45.650 --> 07:46:45.660 align:start position:0%
patients regardless of ability to pay
 
07:46:45.660 --> 07:46:46.430 align:start position:0%
patients regardless of ability to pay
clear

07:46:46.430 --> 07:46:46.440 align:start position:0%
clear
 
07:46:48.650 --> 07:46:48.660 align:start position:0%
with this bill the membership-based
 
07:46:51.048 --> 07:46:51.058 align:start position:0%
model facilities would not be required
 
07:46:53.270 --> 07:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
to adhere to the same licensing
 
07:46:55.730 --> 07:46:55.740 align:start position:0%
requirements and would not offer any
 
07:46:58.910 --> 07:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
charity care for the same services
 
07:47:01.250 --> 07:47:01.260 align:start position:0%
totally unfair
 
07:47:04.368 --> 07:47:04.378 align:start position:0%
House Bill 69 would further compromise
 
07:47:06.890 --> 07:47:06.900 align:start position:0%
your local Community Hospitals if their
 
07:47:09.530 --> 07:47:09.540 align:start position:0%
Workforce is siphoned away to work at
 
07:47:11.510 --> 07:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
these specialized facilities which can
 
07:47:13.850 --> 07:47:13.860 align:start position:0%
offer more attractive schedules and
 
07:47:15.770 --> 07:47:15.780 align:start position:0%
higher compensation
 
07:47:18.530 --> 07:47:18.540 align:start position:0%
as Workforce is the number one issue
 
07:47:21.468 --> 07:47:21.478 align:start position:0%
facing all Health Care Facilities in
 
07:47:23.690 --> 07:47:23.700 align:start position:0%
this state this would be unfair and
 
07:47:26.208 --> 07:47:26.218 align:start position:0%
unacceptable lastly
 
07:47:28.910 --> 07:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
any payments made to these facilities
 
07:47:30.350 --> 07:47:30.360 align:start position:0%
would not count towards their
 
07:47:32.448 --> 07:47:32.458 align:start position:0%
deductibles in their insurance premiums
 
07:47:35.090 --> 07:47:35.100 align:start position:0%
which will only make any further or
 
07:47:35.100 --> 07:47:36.170 align:start position:0%
which will only make any further or
future

07:47:36.170 --> 07:47:36.180 align:start position:0%
future
 
07:47:38.390 --> 07:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
more Specialized Hospital
 
07:47:40.490 --> 07:47:40.500 align:start position:0%
or multi-disciplinary Services more
 
07:47:42.170 --> 07:47:42.180 align:start position:0%
costly to the patients on an annual
 
07:47:46.610 --> 07:47:46.620 align:start position:0%
basis and believe me they will need them
 
07:47:47.810 --> 07:47:47.820 align:start position:0%
in the future
 
07:47:49.910 --> 07:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
hopefully these hospitals will still be
 
07:47:52.670 --> 07:47:52.680 align:start position:0%
maintained and still open
 
07:47:55.730 --> 07:47:55.740 align:start position:0%
this bill fails to recognize the
 
07:47:57.830 --> 07:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
interconnectedness of the New Hampshire
 
07:48:01.010 --> 07:48:01.020 align:start position:0%
Health Care system and by exempting the
 
07:48:03.590 --> 07:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
membership-based facilities from
 
07:48:05.628 --> 07:48:05.638 align:start position:0%
appropriate and equal licensure
 
07:48:08.090 --> 07:48:08.100 align:start position:0%
requirements and allowing them to cherry
 
07:48:10.190 --> 07:48:10.200 align:start position:0%
pick only those highly reimbursed
 
07:48:12.530 --> 07:48:12.540 align:start position:0%
Services while leaving the community and
 
07:48:14.690 --> 07:48:14.700 align:start position:0%
tertiary care hospitals to cover the
 
07:48:14.700 --> 07:48:15.530 align:start position:0%
tertiary care hospitals to cover the
rest

07:48:15.530 --> 07:48:15.540 align:start position:0%
rest
 
07:48:17.810 --> 07:48:17.820 align:start position:0%
will only further burden the taxpayers
 
07:48:19.570 --> 07:48:19.580 align:start position:0%
and the insured
 
07:48:22.310 --> 07:48:22.320 align:start position:0%
licensed facilities that contract with
 
07:48:24.170 --> 07:48:24.180 align:start position:0%
Medicare Medicaid or private insurance
 
07:48:26.510 --> 07:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
and who serve the entire Community
 
07:48:29.090 --> 07:48:29.100 align:start position:0%
should be protected from facilities that
 
07:48:29.100 --> 07:48:30.350 align:start position:0%
should be protected from facilities that
discriminate

07:48:30.350 --> 07:48:30.360 align:start position:0%
discriminate
 
07:48:32.090 --> 07:48:32.100 align:start position:0%
by selecting their patient population
 
07:48:35.208 --> 07:48:35.218 align:start position:0%
according to their ability to pay
 
07:48:37.368 --> 07:48:37.378 align:start position:0%
differential treatment of these
 
07:48:39.590 --> 07:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
facilities and hospitals that provide
 
07:48:43.310 --> 07:48:43.320 align:start position:0%
the same Services is simply unfair it
 
07:48:45.530 --> 07:48:45.540 align:start position:0%
creates a two-tiered system and will
 
07:48:47.510 --> 07:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
compromise our health care in New
 
07:48:50.150 --> 07:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I urge you all and I I hope
 
07:48:51.948 --> 07:48:51.958 align:start position:0%
that you all vote no on the auto pass
 
07:48:55.670 --> 07:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:48:57.410 --> 07:48:57.420 align:start position:0%
remember from Manchester representative
 
07:48:59.090 --> 07:48:59.100 align:start position:0%
McLean's recognized to speak in support
 
07:49:07.910 --> 07:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:49:11.510 --> 07:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr Speaker
 
07:49:13.750 --> 07:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker
 
07:49:17.150 --> 07:49:17.160 align:start position:0%
hb69 simply takes a direct pay model
 
07:49:19.850 --> 07:49:19.860 align:start position:0%
passed into law by this body two years
 
07:49:23.208 --> 07:49:23.218 align:start position:0%
ago for Primary Health Care and expands
 
07:49:25.128 --> 07:49:25.138 align:start position:0%
it to Health Care Facilities
 
07:49:26.690 --> 07:49:26.700 align:start position:0%
supporters of the bill like me believe
 
07:49:28.490 --> 07:49:28.500 align:start position:0%
that it would open up the HealthCare
 
07:49:31.788 --> 07:49:31.798 align:start position:0%
Marketplace just a tiny crack to expand
 
07:49:34.430 --> 07:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
pricing transparency choice and
 
07:49:34.440 --> 07:49:35.690 align:start position:0%
pricing transparency choice and
competition

07:49:35.690 --> 07:49:35.700 align:start position:0%
competition
 
07:49:38.030 --> 07:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
like the direct Primary Care model
 
07:49:41.150 --> 07:49:41.160 align:start position:0%
already in use the bill will grant those
 
07:49:43.070 --> 07:49:43.080 align:start position:0%
facilities and exclusively receive
 
07:49:45.410 --> 07:49:45.420 align:start position:0%
payment directly from the patient the
 
07:49:47.750 --> 07:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
ability to opt out of the all-payer
 
07:49:50.030 --> 07:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
model are currently required in state
 
07:49:53.330 --> 07:49:53.340 align:start position:0%
law because of this those facilities are
 
07:49:55.730 --> 07:49:55.740 align:start position:0%
choose to operate under this model will
 
07:49:58.010 --> 07:49:58.020 align:start position:0%
be completely upfront with their pricing
 
07:50:01.310 --> 07:50:01.320 align:start position:0%
and they may be extremely attractive to
 
07:50:04.368 --> 07:50:04.378 align:start position:0%
those patients who are self-insured or
 
07:50:08.150 --> 07:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
uninsured right just imagine how awesome
 
07:50:10.610 --> 07:50:10.620 align:start position:0%
it would be to be able to go in for a
 
07:50:13.030 --> 07:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
colonoscopy or a hernia surgery
 
07:50:16.430 --> 07:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
and no to the dollar how much you're
 
07:50:18.650 --> 07:50:18.660 align:start position:0%
going to have to pay up front if you're
 
07:50:21.350 --> 07:50:21.360 align:start position:0%
self-insured on a tight budget trying to
 
07:50:24.110 --> 07:50:24.120 align:start position:0%
make the best decisions you can with the
 
07:50:26.690 --> 07:50:26.700 align:start position:0%
resources you have it would be great if
 
07:50:28.730 --> 07:50:28.740 align:start position:0%
you could go to a place where you could
 
07:50:31.190 --> 07:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
escape the Byzantine Billing System of
 
07:50:32.628 --> 07:50:32.638 align:start position:0%
the current system
 
07:50:34.850 --> 07:50:34.860 align:start position:0%
last year I went into the hospital for
 
07:50:38.208 --> 07:50:38.218 align:start position:0%
covid and I received excellent care but
 
07:50:40.368 --> 07:50:40.378 align:start position:0%
over a year later I'm still getting
 
07:50:40.378 --> 07:50:42.070 align:start position:0%
over a year later I'm still getting
bills

07:50:42.070 --> 07:50:42.080 align:start position:0%
bills
 
07:50:45.350 --> 07:50:45.360 align:start position:0%
hb69 may also serve to attract providers
 
07:50:46.968 --> 07:50:46.978 align:start position:0%
to the state who might find that it
 
07:50:48.350 --> 07:50:48.360 align:start position:0%
relieves them of the costly
 
07:50:50.510 --> 07:50:50.520 align:start position:0%
administrative overhead of the all-payer
 
07:50:53.750 --> 07:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
model the bottom line is hb69 is about
 
07:50:56.510 --> 07:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
choice and competition but I want to
 
07:50:59.090 --> 07:50:59.100 align:start position:0%
address some of the concerns opponents
 
07:51:00.650 --> 07:51:00.660 align:start position:0%
of the bill say it's going to lead to
 
07:51:02.570 --> 07:51:02.580 align:start position:0%
Patient cherry picking they say hey
 
07:51:05.150 --> 07:51:05.160 align:start position:0%
because it's so transparent the model is
 
07:51:07.430 --> 07:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
going to lure away the best high-paying
 
07:51:09.230 --> 07:51:09.240 align:start position:0%
customers and it's going to leave
 
07:51:11.510 --> 07:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
hospitals and other facilities with
 
07:51:13.250 --> 07:51:13.260 align:start position:0%
lower paying customers like those on
 
07:51:13.260 --> 07:51:14.270 align:start position:0%
lower paying customers like those on
Medicaid

07:51:14.270 --> 07:51:14.280 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
 
07:51:16.610 --> 07:51:16.620 align:start position:0%
but that that's part of the Bill's
 
07:51:20.868 --> 07:51:20.878 align:start position:0%
intention and it's not a done deal that
 
07:51:23.208 --> 07:51:23.218 align:start position:0%
the hospitals are going to lose in that
 
07:51:25.730 --> 07:51:25.740 align:start position:0%
fight okay the hospitals are going to be
 
07:51:28.850 --> 07:51:28.860 align:start position:0%
free to compete for every single one of
 
07:51:31.128 --> 07:51:31.138 align:start position:0%
those patients and indeed they have a
 
07:51:32.868 --> 07:51:32.878 align:start position:0%
lot to offer those patients as I
 
07:51:35.388 --> 07:51:35.398 align:start position:0%
mentioned they have excellent care and
 
07:51:37.610 --> 07:51:37.620 align:start position:0%
most folks with employer-based insurance
 
07:51:39.948 --> 07:51:39.958 align:start position:0%
are still going to choose them over a
 
07:51:41.690 --> 07:51:41.700 align:start position:0%
facility where they have to pay
 
07:51:43.430 --> 07:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
everything out of their own pocket
 
07:51:43.440 --> 07:51:44.628 align:start position:0%
everything out of their own pocket
however

07:51:44.628 --> 07:51:44.638 align:start position:0%
however
 
07:51:47.570 --> 07:51:47.580 align:start position:0%
if the hospitals want to retain a high
 
07:51:49.548 --> 07:51:49.558 align:start position:0%
capture rate they're going to be forced
 
07:51:51.530 --> 07:51:51.540 align:start position:0%
to look at their business model and the
 
07:51:53.750 --> 07:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
pricing and billing practices and that's
 
07:51:56.150 --> 07:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
a good thing opponents are going to say
 
07:51:58.310 --> 07:51:58.320 align:start position:0%
that you know the bill could bankrupt
 
07:52:00.110 --> 07:52:00.120 align:start position:0%
the state's critical access hospitals
 
07:52:02.208 --> 07:52:02.218 align:start position:0%
and got access to care in the rural
 
07:52:04.368 --> 07:52:04.378 align:start position:0%
regions of the state but the reality is
 
07:52:07.368 --> 07:52:07.378 align:start position:0%
this all of the federal protections
 
07:52:09.650 --> 07:52:09.660 align:start position:0%
granted to critical access hospitals by
 
07:52:12.708 --> 07:52:12.718 align:start position:0%
the balanced budget Act of 1997 remain
 
07:52:16.250 --> 07:52:16.260 align:start position:0%
intact as does the 15-mile exclusion
 
07:52:20.990 --> 07:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
Zone defined an RSA 151 colon 4. so when
 
07:52:23.208 --> 07:52:23.218 align:start position:0%
you lay these exclusion zones over each
 
07:52:25.490 --> 07:52:25.500 align:start position:0%
other the fact of the matter is the only
 
07:52:27.530 --> 07:52:27.540 align:start position:0%
part of the state that remains open to
 
07:52:29.930 --> 07:52:29.940 align:start position:0%
the introduction of the type of facility
 
07:52:32.990 --> 07:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
brought forth in hb69 is in the extreme
 
07:52:36.048 --> 07:52:36.058 align:start position:0%
Southeastern corner of the state but the
 
07:52:37.670 --> 07:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
fact is that since the federal
 
07:52:39.048 --> 07:52:39.058 align:start position:0%
protections for critical access
 
07:52:42.730 --> 07:52:42.740 align:start position:0%
hospitals went into law in 1997 about
 
07:52:46.128 --> 07:52:46.138 align:start position:0%
200 of the country's 800 critical access
 
07:52:48.708 --> 07:52:48.718 align:start position:0%
hospitals have gone bankrupt that's 25
 
07:52:51.650 --> 07:52:51.660 align:start position:0%
percent so if you're counting on the
 
07:52:54.230 --> 07:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
existing regulations to save you it's
 
07:52:56.750 --> 07:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
not going to happen and in fact in in
 
07:52:58.250 --> 07:52:58.260 align:start position:0%
the executive session in the committee
 
07:52:59.750 --> 07:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
we talked about the fact that 70
 
07:53:01.730 --> 07:53:01.740 align:start position:0%
obstetrics departments have closed down
 
07:53:04.070 --> 07:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
across the country was that because of
 
07:53:07.968 --> 07:53:07.978 align:start position:0%
bills like HP 69 and if hb69 and bills
 
07:53:10.430 --> 07:53:10.440 align:start position:0%
like it were not to pass does that
 
07:53:12.048 --> 07:53:12.058 align:start position:0%
magically mean that all these
 
07:53:13.670 --> 07:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
departments and services are going to
 
07:53:16.788 --> 07:53:16.798 align:start position:0%
come back no they're not the truth is
 
07:53:19.388 --> 07:53:19.398 align:start position:0%
the current operating model is
 
07:53:21.530 --> 07:53:21.540 align:start position:0%
non-sustainable and our Health Care
 
07:53:23.570 --> 07:53:23.580 align:start position:0%
system is on a Glide path to implosion
 
07:53:26.750 --> 07:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
if we don't innovate in October 2020
 
07:53:28.910 --> 07:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
Lakes Region General Hospital filed for
 
07:53:32.570 --> 07:53:32.580 align:start position:0%
bankruptcy at issue was not HB 69 hb69
 
07:53:35.628 --> 07:53:35.638 align:start position:0%
did not exist at issue was the fact that
 
07:53:37.430 --> 07:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
they had made some decisions that were
 
07:53:39.888 --> 07:53:39.898 align:start position:0%
in hindsight unwise and they still might
 
07:53:41.930 --> 07:53:41.940 align:start position:0%
have pulled through except for the fact
 
07:53:43.670 --> 07:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
that their operating structure was such
 
07:53:45.468 --> 07:53:45.478 align:start position:0%
that they were losing millions of
 
07:53:47.868 --> 07:53:47.878 align:start position:0%
dollars a year and as a result they
 
07:53:50.090 --> 07:53:50.100 align:start position:0%
never realistically had any chance for
 
07:53:52.730 --> 07:53:52.740 align:start position:0%
recovery and if things don't change they
 
07:53:54.530 --> 07:53:54.540 align:start position:0%
won't be alone in the future
 
07:53:56.990 --> 07:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
opponents say that hb69 would allow
 
07:53:58.730 --> 07:53:58.740 align:start position:0%
certain facilities not to play by the
 
07:54:00.530 --> 07:54:00.540 align:start position:0%
rules but my friends what I'm submitting
 
07:54:02.810 --> 07:54:02.820 align:start position:0%
to you now is that the rules are the
 
07:54:04.850 --> 07:54:04.860 align:start position:0%
problem the rules are a large part of
 
07:54:07.190 --> 07:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
the reason that this state in spite of
 
07:54:09.888 --> 07:54:09.898 align:start position:0%
its ever-growing population has not had
 
07:54:13.730 --> 07:54:13.740 align:start position:0%
a new hospital in over 30 years finally
 
07:54:15.708 --> 07:54:15.718 align:start position:0%
let's just contrast the way that we look
 
07:54:17.628 --> 07:54:17.638 align:start position:0%
at health care and the way we look at
 
07:54:20.030 --> 07:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
renewable energy on the renewable energy
 
07:54:22.490 --> 07:54:22.500 align:start position:0%
front we enacted regulations like the
 
07:54:24.590 --> 07:54:24.600 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard so that we
 
07:54:26.868 --> 07:54:26.878 align:start position:0%
could explore all forms of renewable
 
07:54:29.270 --> 07:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
energy and find out what's right for New
 
07:54:31.670 --> 07:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire what's the bet best fit for
 
07:54:32.690 --> 07:54:32.700 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
07:54:35.628 --> 07:54:35.638 align:start position:0%
in contrast in health care it's just the
 
07:54:37.670 --> 07:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
opposite our health care regulations
 
07:54:40.730 --> 07:54:40.740 align:start position:0%
kill Innovation and they force everyone
 
07:54:43.850 --> 07:54:43.860 align:start position:0%
into one unsustainable model that
 
07:54:46.430 --> 07:54:46.440 align:start position:0%
everyone can see is ultimately doomed to
 
07:54:50.628 --> 07:54:50.638 align:start position:0%
fail hb69 isn't the problem it's part of
 
07:54:54.830 --> 07:54:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:54:56.750 --> 07:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
is on the motion of ought to pass on
 
07:54:59.030 --> 07:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
House Bill 69 representative Santo
 
07:55:01.190 --> 07:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
nastazo requests a roll call and it is
 
07:55:03.110 --> 07:55:03.120 align:start position:0%
sufficiently seconded this will be a
 
07:55:04.730 --> 07:55:04.740 align:start position:0%
roll call vote members please take your
 
07:55:04.740 --> 07:55:10.910 align:start position:0%
roll call vote members please take your
seats

07:55:10.910 --> 07:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:55:10.920 --> 07:56:17.810 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

07:56:17.810 --> 07:56:17.820 align:start position:0%
 
07:56:22.730 --> 07:56:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
07:56:25.010 --> 07:56:25.020 align:start position:0%
the question is on the motion of ought
 
07:56:28.128 --> 07:56:28.138 align:start position:0%
to pass on House Bill 69 representative
 
07:56:29.810 --> 07:56:29.820 align:start position:0%
Murphy is recognized for parliamentary
 
07:56:29.820 --> 07:56:34.490 align:start position:0%
Murphy is recognized for parliamentary
inquiry

07:56:34.490 --> 07:56:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
07:56:36.530 --> 07:56:36.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
07:56:39.288 --> 07:56:39.298 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that the prior
 
07:56:41.510 --> 07:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
arguments you just heard only further
 
07:56:44.090 --> 07:56:44.100 align:start position:0%
reinforce many of my comments and
 
07:56:47.570 --> 07:56:47.580 align:start position:0%
concerns but that today alone we are not
 
07:56:49.430 --> 07:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
going to change the entire Health Care
 
07:56:52.250 --> 07:56:52.260 align:start position:0%
System broadly speaking and that this
 
07:56:54.410 --> 07:56:54.420 align:start position:0%
bill would simply hurt
 
07:56:56.388 --> 07:56:56.398 align:start position:0%
Our Community Hospitals and the care
 
07:56:59.090 --> 07:56:59.100 align:start position:0%
that we receive 24 7 from those
 
07:57:02.990 --> 07:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
facilities if I also know that as
 
07:57:04.730 --> 07:57:04.740 align:start position:0%
President Ronald Reagan once said that
 
07:57:06.530 --> 07:57:06.540 align:start position:0%
Health Care Providers have a societal
 
07:57:08.750 --> 07:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
obligation and that the proposed
 
07:57:10.730 --> 07:57:10.740 align:start position:0%
licensure exemption for these
 
07:57:12.590 --> 07:57:12.600 align:start position:0%
member-based facilities means that they
 
07:57:15.350 --> 07:57:15.360 align:start position:0%
are not obligated to care for all
 
07:57:18.230 --> 07:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
patients regardless of ability to pay
 
07:57:20.090 --> 07:57:20.100 align:start position:0%
and if I know that this bill would place
 
07:57:23.030 --> 07:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
an undue burden a significant undue
 
07:57:24.708 --> 07:57:24.718 align:start position:0%
burden on the New Hampshire hospitals
 
07:57:26.990 --> 07:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
that are already stressed
 
07:57:29.090 --> 07:57:29.100 align:start position:0%
and that maintain the many needed
 
07:57:31.430 --> 07:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
Services the many needed broad services
 
07:57:35.448 --> 07:57:35.458 align:start position:0%
that we all require 24 7 while adhering
 
07:57:37.968 --> 07:57:37.978 align:start position:0%
to their charity care policies as
 
07:57:40.368 --> 07:57:40.378 align:start position:0%
required by their licensure
 
07:57:42.230 --> 07:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
and finally if I know that this bill
 
07:57:44.150 --> 07:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
fails to recognize the
 
07:57:45.530 --> 07:57:45.540 align:start position:0%
interconnectedness of the Health Care
 
07:57:47.750 --> 07:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
system in New Hampshire and will further
 
07:57:50.388 --> 07:57:50.398 align:start position:0%
burden taxpayers and those insured what
 
07:57:53.150 --> 07:57:53.160 align:start position:0%
I now read push the red button uh on the
 
07:57:56.810 --> 07:57:56.820 align:start position:0%
motion uh ought to pass thank you
 
07:57:58.788 --> 07:57:58.798 align:start position:0%
representative kofos recognized for
 
07:58:03.048 --> 07:58:03.058 align:start position:0%
 
07:58:05.990 --> 07:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
07:58:08.930 --> 07:58:08.940 align:start position:0%
if I know that the restrictions that
 
07:58:11.448 --> 07:58:11.458 align:start position:0%
this bill attempts to roll back have
 
07:58:15.770 --> 07:58:15.780 align:start position:0%
been in place only since 2016.
 
07:58:17.388 --> 07:58:17.398 align:start position:0%
and further if I know that critical
 
07:58:20.868 --> 07:58:20.878 align:start position:0%
access hospitals existed before 2016.
 
07:58:23.150 --> 07:58:23.160 align:start position:0%
and they will continue to be protected
 
07:58:26.930 --> 07:58:26.940 align:start position:0%
if this bill passes
 
07:58:28.430 --> 07:58:28.440 align:start position:0%
furthermore if I know that Innovative
 
07:58:30.770 --> 07:58:30.780 align:start position:0%
facilities that this bill would unleash
 
07:58:33.530 --> 07:58:33.540 align:start position:0%
are unlikely to be opened in sparsely
 
07:58:37.010 --> 07:58:37.020 align:start position:0%
populated rural areas
 
07:58:39.110 --> 07:58:39.120 align:start position:0%
and if I know that protectionism
 
07:58:39.120 --> 07:58:41.388 align:start position:0%
and if I know that protectionism
disincentivizes

07:58:41.388 --> 07:58:41.398 align:start position:0%
disincentivizes
 
07:58:45.170 --> 07:58:45.180 align:start position:0%
Innovation and harms patients would I
 
07:58:47.750 --> 07:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
then press the green button to pass this
 
07:58:51.048 --> 07:58:51.058 align:start position:0%

Speaker having voting on the prevailing
 
08:00:15.708 --> 08:00:15.718 align:start position:0%
side I move reconsideration and I ask

previous sponsors of this same bill
 
08:08:10.310 --> 08:08:10.320 align:start position:0%
disclosed in testimony in committee that
 
08:08:11.930 --> 08:08:11.940 align:start position:0%
this is just the first step in removing
 
08:08:13.788 --> 08:08:13.798 align:start position:0%
the rights of parents to oversee their
 
08:08:16.310 --> 08:08:16.320 align:start position:0%
child's mental health care and the goal
 
08:08:19.610 --> 08:08:19.620 align:start position:0%
is to get the age down to 20 12.
 
08:08:22.070 --> 08:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
we need to stop this right here right
 
08:08:22.080 --> 08:08:23.150 align:start position:0%
we need to stop this right here right
now

08:08:23.150 --> 08:08:23.160 align:start position:0%
now
 
08:08:25.310 --> 08:08:25.320 align:start position:0%
the erosion of a parent's right to
 
08:08:27.650 --> 08:08:27.660 align:start position:0%
provide for their children's well-being
 
08:08:30.230 --> 08:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
to be informed of what is happening in
 
08:08:32.448 --> 08:08:32.458 align:start position:0%
their lives and to be involved in
 
08:08:35.930 --> 08:08:35.940 align:start position:0%
resolving mental health issues is a sign
 
08:08:39.468 --> 08:08:39.478 align:start position:0%
that our society is failing families
 
08:08:41.930 --> 08:08:41.940 align:start position:0%
families are the backbone of society the
 
08:08:45.530 --> 08:08:45.540 align:start position:0%
member will suspend it is awful awful
 
08:08:47.628 --> 08:08:47.638 align:start position:0%
noisy in here the member has a right to
 
08:08:50.510 --> 08:08:50.520 align:start position:0%
be heard again if you need to have a
 
08:08:52.310 --> 08:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
conversation take it out into the Annie
 
08:08:52.320 --> 08:08:53.570 align:start position:0%
conversation take it out into the Annie
room

08:08:53.570 --> 08:08:53.580 align:start position:0%
room
 
08:08:55.610 --> 08:08:55.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
08:08:58.490 --> 08:08:58.500 align:start position:0%
families are the backbone of society and
 
08:09:00.468 --> 08:09:00.478 align:start position:0%
there are currently many forces trying
 
08:09:02.868 --> 08:09:02.878 align:start position:0%
to drive a wedge between children and
 
08:09:04.610 --> 08:09:04.620 align:start position:0%
their parents
 
08:09:07.128 --> 08:09:07.138 align:start position:0%
this is a common tactic of totalitarian
 
08:09:09.590 --> 08:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
regimes of the past and we should not
 
08:09:12.410 --> 08:09:12.420 align:start position:0%
accept any incrementalist legislation
 
08:09:14.510 --> 08:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
towards stripping parents of their
 
08:09:16.910 --> 08:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
natural right to direct the upbringing
 
08:09:18.350 --> 08:09:18.360 align:start position:0%
of their children
 
08:09:20.628 --> 08:09:20.638 align:start position:0%
furthermore Mr Speaker this bill does
 
08:09:22.610 --> 08:09:22.620 align:start position:0%
not address the issue presented about
 
08:09:24.948 --> 08:09:24.958 align:start position:0%
who pays for the mental health treatment
 
08:09:27.110 --> 08:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
children do not routinely manage their
 
08:09:28.610 --> 08:09:28.620 align:start position:0%
own medical bills unless they are
 
08:09:30.350 --> 08:09:30.360 align:start position:0%
emancipated minors
 
08:09:31.968 --> 08:09:31.978 align:start position:0%
if the children are under their parents
 
08:09:33.590 --> 08:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
health insurance plans then as the
 
08:09:35.510 --> 08:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
payers the parents have a vested
 
08:09:37.250 --> 08:09:37.260 align:start position:0%
interest in what health services their
 
08:09:39.948 --> 08:09:39.958 align:start position:0%
children are receiving beyond the innate
 
08:09:42.170 --> 08:09:42.180 align:start position:0%
desire and Duty they have to ensure
 
08:09:44.690 --> 08:09:44.700 align:start position:0%
their children are happy and healthy
 
08:09:46.368 --> 08:09:46.378 align:start position:0%
this bill does not deal with that
 
08:09:48.530 --> 08:09:48.540 align:start position:0%
conflict whatsoever
 
08:09:50.448 --> 08:09:50.458 align:start position:0%
most of you know that I'm a registered
 
08:09:53.030 --> 08:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
nurse in general it is understood that
 
08:09:55.548 --> 08:09:55.558 align:start position:0%
miners under the age of 18 cannot
 
08:09:57.590 --> 08:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
consent to Medical Care
 
08:10:00.110 --> 08:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
they can assent But ultimately consent
 
08:10:01.850 --> 08:10:01.860 align:start position:0%
is still required to be obtained from
 
08:10:04.128 --> 08:10:04.138 align:start position:0%
their parent or Guardian Mental Health
 
08:10:06.350 --> 08:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
Care is no different
 
08:10:08.990 --> 08:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker parents are assumed under
 
08:10:11.270 --> 08:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
common law to act in the best interest
 
08:10:13.850 --> 08:10:13.860 align:start position:0%
of their children they have the maturity
 
08:10:16.128 --> 08:10:16.138 align:start position:0%
and wisdom to help guide their children
 
08:10:17.690 --> 08:10:17.700 align:start position:0%
in navigating the trials and
 
08:10:19.430 --> 08:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
tribulations of life
 
08:10:21.708 --> 08:10:21.718 align:start position:0%
how can they do that if we legislators
 
08:10:23.570 --> 08:10:23.580 align:start position:0%
create a structure
 
08:10:25.968 --> 08:10:25.978 align:start position:0%
that for children to hide things from
 
08:10:27.650 --> 08:10:27.660 align:start position:0%
their parents
 
08:10:29.150 --> 08:10:29.160 align:start position:0%
there is nothing wrong with a child
 
08:10:31.250 --> 08:10:31.260 align:start position:0%
going to a therapist and having a safe
 
08:10:33.288 --> 08:10:33.298 align:start position:0%
space to talk about their feelings and
 
08:10:35.990 --> 08:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
08:10:38.810 --> 08:10:38.820 align:start position:0%
but the parents should also be involved
 
08:10:41.150 --> 08:10:41.160 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't be kept in the dark if
 
08:10:43.430 --> 08:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
there are concerns about abuse we have
 
08:10:44.930 --> 08:10:44.940 align:start position:0%
procedures for reporting and
 
08:10:44.940 --> 08:10:46.490 align:start position:0%
procedures for reporting and
investigating

08:10:46.490 --> 08:10:46.500 align:start position:0%
investigating
 
08:10:49.010 --> 08:10:49.020 align:start position:0%
and with due process the rights of
 
08:10:50.990 --> 08:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
parents can be suspended and then
 
08:10:52.548 --> 08:10:52.558 align:start position:0%
children may attain Mental Health Care
 
08:10:54.110 --> 08:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
without their consent
 
08:10:55.850 --> 08:10:55.860 align:start position:0%
but without proof that there is some
 
08:10:57.410 --> 08:10:57.420 align:start position:0%
compelling reason
 
08:10:59.868 --> 08:10:59.878 align:start position:0%
to take the rights of parents away
 
08:11:02.150 --> 08:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
they should maintain that right to
 
08:11:04.368 --> 08:11:04.378 align:start position:0%
direct the care for the well-being of
 
08:11:05.690 --> 08:11:05.700 align:start position:0%
their children
 
08:11:07.910 --> 08:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
we should not give this even one inch
 
08:11:10.010 --> 08:11:10.020 align:start position:0%
parents have the right to know what is
 
08:11:11.810 --> 08:11:11.820 align:start position:0%
going on with their children and the
 
08:11:13.430 --> 08:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
state legislature should not be creating
 
08:11:15.288 --> 08:11:15.298 align:start position:0%
wedges in families and taking away
 
08:11:17.868 --> 08:11:17.878 align:start position:0%
parental rights without due process
 
08:11:17.878 --> 08:11:19.128 align:start position:0%
parental rights without due process
period

08:11:19.128 --> 08:11:19.138 align:start position:0%
period
 
08:11:21.708 --> 08:11:21.718 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
08:11:28.910 --> 08:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
08:11:33.530 --> 08:11:33.540 align:start position:0%
 
08:11:35.750 --> 08:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
I stand before you today to speak in
 
08:11:39.048 --> 08:11:39.058 align:start position:0%
favor of House Bill 114 a bill that will
 
08:11:42.170 --> 08:11:42.180 align:start position:0%
allow anyone 16 years or older to
 
08:11:44.810 --> 08:11:44.820 align:start position:0%
consent to mental health treatment
 
08:11:47.810 --> 08:11:47.820 align:start position:0%
this is a short and simple bill it does
 
08:11:49.788 --> 08:11:49.798 align:start position:0%
not address payment
 
08:11:52.190 --> 08:11:52.200 align:start position:0%
it does not require a mental health
 
08:11:54.350 --> 08:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
practitioner to provide services to
 
08:11:54.360 --> 08:11:55.788 align:start position:0%
practitioner to provide services to
minors

08:11:55.788 --> 08:11:55.798 align:start position:0%
minors
 
08:11:58.610 --> 08:11:58.620 align:start position:0%
it explicitly disallows the prescribing
 
08:12:02.690 --> 08:12:02.700 align:start position:0%
of medication without parental consent
 
08:12:04.910 --> 08:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
it does not create an authoritarian
 
08:12:04.920 --> 08:12:06.350 align:start position:0%
it does not create an authoritarian
regime

08:12:06.350 --> 08:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
regime
 
08:12:10.010 --> 08:12:10.020 align:start position:0%
it simply says that a mature minor 16
 
08:12:12.650 --> 08:12:12.660 align:start position:0%
years and older can participate in
 
08:12:14.990 --> 08:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
counseling with a willing licensed
 
08:12:17.448 --> 08:12:17.458 align:start position:0%
provider without the consent of their
 
08:12:19.448 --> 08:12:19.458 align:start position:0%
parent or Guardian
 
08:12:23.030 --> 08:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
in fact this bill would clarify and
 
08:12:25.670 --> 08:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
perhaps limit the age at which a minor
 
08:12:27.650 --> 08:12:27.660 align:start position:0%
can obtain services without parent
 
08:12:29.690 --> 08:12:29.700 align:start position:0%
parent consent
 
08:12:32.868 --> 08:12:32.878 align:start position:0%
current New Hampshire law provides that
 
08:12:36.468 --> 08:12:36.478 align:start position:0%
quote any person quote can apply for
 
08:12:39.410 --> 08:12:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
08:12:42.948 --> 08:12:42.958 align:start position:0%
not a radical idea currently 31 states
 
08:12:45.590 --> 08:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
have Provisions expanding Mental Health
 
08:12:47.990 --> 08:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
Services to minors there are many
 
08:12:50.388 --> 08:12:50.398 align:start position:0%
reasons for this
 
08:12:53.090 --> 08:12:53.100 align:start position:0%
While most adolescents have caring
 
08:12:55.190 --> 08:12:55.200 align:start position:0%
competent and responsible parents to
 
08:12:58.430 --> 08:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
guide and care for them some do not
 
08:13:02.090 --> 08:13:02.100 align:start position:0%
ravaged by poverty addiction mental
 
08:13:04.968 --> 08:13:04.978 align:start position:0%
illness or intergenerational trauma
 
08:13:07.490 --> 08:13:07.500 align:start position:0%
some parents are simply unable to
 
08:13:10.490 --> 08:13:10.500 align:start position:0%
respond to the needs of their children
 
08:13:12.770 --> 08:13:12.780 align:start position:0%
some adolescents are in fact homeless
 
08:13:15.770 --> 08:13:15.780 align:start position:0%
and fending for themselves
 
08:13:18.048 --> 08:13:18.058 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire suicide is the second
 
08:13:20.510 --> 08:13:20.520 align:start position:0%
leading cause of death among individuals
 
08:13:23.448 --> 08:13:23.458 align:start position:0%
10 to 24 years of age
 
08:13:26.330 --> 08:13:26.340 align:start position:0%
and suicidal ideation and behavior is
 
08:13:31.190 --> 08:13:31.200 align:start position:0%
especially prominent among lgbtq youth
 
08:13:33.770 --> 08:13:33.780 align:start position:0%
the parents of immigrant adolescents May
 
08:13:35.930 --> 08:13:35.940 align:start position:0%
view mental health treatment as a
 
08:13:37.548 --> 08:13:37.558 align:start position:0%
foreign idea
 
08:13:40.670 --> 08:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
and or be fearful of giving consent to
 
08:13:42.830 --> 08:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
those in authority
 
08:13:46.610 --> 08:13:46.620 align:start position:0%
finally a maturing 16 or 17 year old in
 
08:13:48.410 --> 08:13:48.420 align:start position:0%
the process of developing their own
 
08:13:50.510 --> 08:13:50.520 align:start position:0%
adult identity
 
08:13:52.910 --> 08:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
we call that individuation
 
08:13:56.270 --> 08:13:56.280 align:start position:0%
made simply not be ready to share their
 
08:13:58.070 --> 08:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
particular struggle with their parents
 
08:14:02.090 --> 08:14:02.100 align:start position:0%
and in fact a skilled provider will be
 
08:14:03.650 --> 08:14:03.660 align:start position:0%
able to help them speak with their
 
08:14:06.468 --> 08:14:06.478 align:start position:0%
parents when they are ready and when
 
08:14:07.910 --> 08:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
they are able
 
08:14:12.770 --> 08:14:12.780 align:start position:0%
 
08:14:15.288 --> 08:14:15.298 align:start position:0%
as legislators we are often called upon
 
08:14:17.930 --> 08:14:17.940 align:start position:0%
to assess the relative benefits and
 
08:14:20.090 --> 08:14:20.100 align:start position:0%
consequences of doing something
 
08:14:22.010 --> 08:14:22.020 align:start position:0%
or not doing something
 
08:14:24.110 --> 08:14:24.120 align:start position:0%
voting for or against the bill that
 
08:14:25.788 --> 08:14:25.798 align:start position:0%
comes before us
 
08:14:28.430 --> 08:14:28.440 align:start position:0%
if we do not pass this bill some
 
08:14:30.770 --> 08:14:30.780 align:start position:0%
deserving youth will go without much
 
08:14:32.330 --> 08:14:32.340 align:start position:0%
needed care
 
08:14:35.510 --> 08:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
if we do pass this bill
 
08:14:37.850 --> 08:14:37.860 align:start position:0%
we might in some
 
08:14:40.368 --> 08:14:40.378 align:start position:0%
some way limit a parent's very important
 
08:14:42.530 --> 08:14:42.540 align:start position:0%
role in their child's life
 
08:14:44.750 --> 08:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
to this I would say to you
 
08:14:47.628 --> 08:14:47.638 align:start position:0%
please trust that the vast majority of
 
08:14:50.150 --> 08:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire parents are compassionate
 
08:14:53.030 --> 08:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
and competent that they absolutely want
 
08:14:55.670 --> 08:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
the best for their children this change
 
08:14:58.548 --> 08:14:58.558 align:start position:0%
will not diminish those strong bonds
 
08:15:00.888 --> 08:15:00.898 align:start position:0%
however for those youth lacking capable
 
08:15:03.530 --> 08:15:03.540 align:start position:0%
parents or in situations where there is
 
08:15:05.270 --> 08:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
a temporary breach
 
08:15:07.190 --> 08:15:07.200 align:start position:0%
counseling will make a world of
 
08:15:07.200 --> 08:15:08.330 align:start position:0%
counseling will make a world of
difference

08:15:08.330 --> 08:15:08.340 align:start position:0%
difference
 
08:15:10.430 --> 08:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
please join me in supporting the
 
08:15:12.468 --> 08:15:12.478 align:start position:0%
majority recommendation of ought to pass
 
08:15:15.410 --> 08:15:15.420 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 114 by pushing the green
 
08:15:17.810 --> 08:15:17.820 align:start position:0%
button and I would ask for a division
 
08:15:17.820 --> 08:15:19.070 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker

08:17:12.590 --> 08:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
to Medical Psychiatric Services is
 
08:17:14.750 --> 08:17:14.760 align:start position:0%

if I know that a small percentage of
 
08:17:48.830 --> 08:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
adolescents do not have parents who are
 
08:17:51.948 --> 08:17:51.958 align:start position:0%
capable or available to assist them
 
08:17:54.530 --> 08:17:54.540 align:start position:0%

and Mr Speaker if I believe that the
 
08:18:08.810 --> 08:18:08.820 align:start position:0%
great majority of New Hampshire parents
 
08:18:11.570 --> 08:18:11.580 align:start position:0%
have positive strong relationships with
 
08:18:13.788 --> 08:18:13.798 align:start position:0%
their teenage children and that
 
08:18:16.070 --> 08:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
permission for the needy few to seek
 
08:18:18.590 --> 08:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
help will in no way weaken those strong
 
08:18:20.330 --> 08:18:20.340 align:start position:0%
family bonds
 
08:18:22.548 --> 08:18:22.558 align:start position:0%
would I push the green button and

Mr Speaker and esteemed colleagues today
 
08:27:10.010 --> 08:27:10.020 align:start position:0%
I Rise to oppose itl on HB 342.
 
08:27:11.930 --> 08:27:11.940 align:start position:0%
my experience in the state house and
 
08:27:13.910 --> 08:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
working with both parties has led me to
 
08:27:15.468 --> 08:27:15.478 align:start position:0%
the following conclusion
 
08:27:18.288 --> 08:27:18.298 align:start position:0%
we rarely disagree on the principle of a
 
08:27:20.628 --> 08:27:20.638 align:start position:0%
bill and we often disagree on the
 
08:27:20.638 --> 08:27:22.010 align:start position:0%
bill and we often disagree on the
solution

08:27:22.010 --> 08:27:22.020 align:start position:0%
solution
 
08:27:25.968 --> 08:27:25.978 align:start position:0%
HP 342 is an example of how we agree and
 
08:27:28.310 --> 08:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
yet disagree
 
08:27:31.250 --> 08:27:31.260 align:start position:0%
HB 342 requires all children to be
 
08:27:33.708 --> 08:27:33.718 align:start position:0%
tested for blood level lead levels
 
08:27:37.070 --> 08:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
before their first entry into school and
 
08:27:38.990 --> 08:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
if not tested before this time will be
 
08:27:40.548 --> 08:27:40.558 align:start position:0%
given six months to remedy the
 
08:27:40.558 --> 08:27:42.530 align:start position:0%
given six months to remedy the
deficiency

08:27:42.530 --> 08:27:42.540 align:start position:0%
deficiency
 
08:27:44.510 --> 08:27:44.520 align:start position:0%
I hope we all agree our children are
 
08:27:46.910 --> 08:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
important to us enough to watch out for
 
08:27:49.368 --> 08:27:49.378 align:start position:0%
their General Health we also know lead
 
08:27:51.110 --> 08:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
and children's blood affects their
 
08:27:52.430 --> 08:27:52.440 align:start position:0%
learning ability
 
08:27:54.468 --> 08:27:54.478 align:start position:0%
it is also known that if a child is
 
08:27:56.628 --> 08:27:56.638 align:start position:0%
found to have lead levels exceeding five
 
08:27:59.990 --> 08:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
micrograms per deciliter there are ways
 
08:28:01.968 --> 08:28:01.978 align:start position:0%
to reduce these Levels by changing a
 
08:28:03.350 --> 08:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
child's diet
 
08:28:05.930 --> 08:28:05.940 align:start position:0%
so testing can be a good thing
 
08:28:08.628 --> 08:28:08.638 align:start position:0%
however let's look at what happens when
 
08:28:10.850 --> 08:28:10.860 align:start position:0%
a child is found to have blood levels
 
08:28:13.968 --> 08:28:13.978 align:start position:0%
lead levels more than five micrograms
 
08:28:15.468 --> 08:28:15.478 align:start position:0%
per deciliter
 
08:28:18.230 --> 08:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
we have a constituent in Hillsborough
 
08:28:20.810 --> 08:28:20.820 align:start position:0%
County where the five with with
 
08:28:24.250 --> 08:28:24.260 align:start position:0%
five-year-old twin boys one tested 7.5
 
08:28:27.410 --> 08:28:27.420 align:start position:0%
and the other tested 9.5
 
08:28:29.810 --> 08:28:29.820 align:start position:0%
they are now on a diet and the parents
 
08:28:32.208 --> 08:28:32.218 align:start position:0%
parents are confident the lead levels
 
08:28:34.850 --> 08:28:34.860 align:start position:0%
will be reversed in that end time
 
08:28:37.190 --> 08:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
that's good news right
 
08:28:39.288 --> 08:28:39.298 align:start position:0%
not so fast
 
08:28:41.350 --> 08:28:41.360 align:start position:0%
those results were reported to the state
 
08:28:43.850 --> 08:28:43.860 align:start position:0%
and then their land where landlord was
 
08:28:46.610 --> 08:28:46.620 align:start position:0%
contacted the landlord now facing a lead
 
08:28:48.590 --> 08:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
abatement of a typical income property
 
08:28:50.330 --> 08:28:50.340 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
08:28:52.070 --> 08:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
one of the states with the oldest
 
08:28:54.128 --> 08:28:54.138 align:start position:0%
housing inventories in the nation
 
08:28:57.230 --> 08:28:57.240 align:start position:0%
decided to handle the case by issuing
 
08:29:00.230 --> 08:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
the family unnoticed to vacate

the most common source of lead exposure
 
08:32:00.110 --> 08:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
comes from lead dust that is Created

08:33:27.888 --> 08:33:27.898 align:start position:0%
so having this test done at least once
 
08:33:30.708 --> 08:33:30.718 align:start position:0%
during a child's first six years we

since it's a fact that let ingestion

08:36:38.750 --> 08:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
08:36:41.090 --> 08:36:41.100 align:start position:0%
know that children are already required
 
08:36:43.670 --> 08:36:43.680 align:start position:0%

six
 
08:36:47.208 --> 08:36:47.218 align:start position:0%
and if I know that recent low testing
 
08:36:49.850 --> 08:36:49.860 align:start position:0%
rates were due to the recall of the lead
 
08:36:51.708 --> 08:36:51.718 align:start position:0%
testing machines
 
08:36:54.230 --> 08:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
and if I know that linking lead testing
 
08:36:57.770 --> 08:36:57.780 align:start position:0%
to entry into child care and schools has
 
08:37:00.110 --> 08:37:00.120 align:start position:0%
the potential to flood new

at the same time

both child care and family-friendly
 
08:37:11.930 --> 08:37:11.940 align:start position:0%
