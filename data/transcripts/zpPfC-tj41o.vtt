all

00:09:05.509 --> 00:09:05.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
and just please identify yourselves for
 
00:09:10.269 --> 00:09:10.279 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
committee good morning uh Joe stanel the
 
00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
superintendent at Hillsboro County
 
00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:15.680 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
Corrections Tim conin I'm the uh booking
 
00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:23.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
supervisor so if you could um whether or
 
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:28.120 align:start position:0%
not you're aware we've retained about
 
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
five or six bills that have to do with
 
00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
um bail changing conditions of bail
 
00:09:33.829 --> 00:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
things of that nature and what we've
 
00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:35.240 align:start position:0%
been asking the counties because the
 
00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:37.320 align:start position:0%
counties are the folks who end up with
 
00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:39.560 align:start position:0%
these people after they've been arrested
 
00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
waiting for bail or returned after bail
 
00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:44.320 align:start position:0%
if you could tell us your involvement in
 
00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:46.200 align:start position:0%
that system what if any kind of
 
00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:48.760 align:start position:0%
pre-trial programs you have how you deal
 
00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:50.800 align:start position:0%
with people that are on bail and how it
 
00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:53.000 align:start position:0%
impacts you and how any changes could
 
00:09:55.269 --> 00:09:55.279 align:start position:0%
impact you we'd love to hear
 
00:09:59.110 --> 00:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
it well good morning again um I can talk
 
00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:01.720 align:start position:0%
talk to this uh I guess I would say from
 
00:10:03.389 --> 00:10:03.399 align:start position:0%
my experience obviously working in
 
00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
Corrections um I've been in it for a
 
00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:08.200 align:start position:0%
period of time now um every facility is
 
00:10:09.509 --> 00:10:09.519 align:start position:0%
a little bit different different
 
00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
counties are a little bit different um
 
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
10 jails 10 superintendents but when it
 
00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:17.320 align:start position:0%
comes down to the basics of what we do
 
00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:20.600 align:start position:0%
as Corrections um and and that is the
 
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
Safety and Security of of the
 
00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
institution and of the community um over
 
00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:29.160 align:start position:0%
the years we've seen drastic changes um
 
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
in our populations one stems from bail
 
00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:34.680 align:start position:0%
reform one stem from coid um where our
 
00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:36.760 align:start position:0%
populations really dropped and when I
 
00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:40.680 align:start position:0%
say really dropped um uh they would they
 
00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
would go from an average daily
 
00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:44.120 align:start position:0%
population someplace down in Hillsboro
 
00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:45.680 align:start position:0%
prior to me getting down there I do want
 
00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:47.519 align:start position:0%
to say that um I was previously the
 
00:10:50.629 --> 00:10:50.639 align:start position:0%
superintendent marac and up until uh
 
00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:53.560 align:start position:0%
July of 22 August of 22 and then I
 
00:10:54.949 --> 00:10:54.959 align:start position:0%
transitioned right over to Hillsboro so
 
00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:56.240 align:start position:0%
I've been there just a little bit over a
 
00:10:59.150 --> 00:10:59.160 align:start position:0%
year um their population used to sit
 
00:11:02.389 --> 00:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
around I would say probably 400 500 um
 
00:11:04.829 --> 00:11:04.839 align:start position:0%
daily population when I got down there
 
00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
we're hovering in the mid 200s um I can
 
00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
tell you today we're at 340 roughly
 
00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:11.750 align:start position:0%
tell you today we're at 340 roughly
around

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:11:15.829 --> 00:11:15.839 align:start position:0%
340 um the impacts of the bail um I will
 
00:11:18.069 --> 00:11:18.079 align:start position:0%
say in general and and I think this is a
 
00:11:20.949 --> 00:11:20.959 align:start position:0%
good platform to have this discussion is
 
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:24.720 align:start position:0%
um we are seeing individuals come in um
 
00:11:26.389 --> 00:11:26.399 align:start position:0%
in the worst medical conditions that
 
00:11:28.509 --> 00:11:28.519 align:start position:0%
we've ever seen them um I have ever seen
 
00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:30.440 align:start position:0%
them in my experience and
 
00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:33.880 align:start position:0%
Corrections um when you talk about costs
 
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
that's uh that's a sh that's that's a
 
00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:41.720 align:start position:0%
large part of that now I had
 
00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
uh previously we've had discussions
 
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
amongst the superintendent as you know
 
00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:48.200 align:start position:0%
it's very hard to lock down what an
 
00:11:51.949 --> 00:11:51.959 align:start position:0%
average daily rate is for a a individual
 
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:53.720 align:start position:0%
in custody I mean there's a formula you
 
00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:56.600 align:start position:0%
can break it down with that's you take
 
00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
your budget you break it down by 365 and
 
00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:00.720 align:start position:0%
then and You by that you break down how
 
00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
many Imes you have and you come out with
 
00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:03.800 align:start position:0%
an estimated cost so let's just say if
 
00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
it was
 
00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.350 align:start position:0%
it was
$155

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
$155
 
00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:09.160 align:start position:0%
right the problem with that is to give
 
00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:11.560 align:start position:0%
it an actual estimated cost like that is
 
00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
we could have one individual for example
 
00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:17.240 align:start position:0%
that would cost us $30,000 a month in
 
00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
medication costs depending on what
 
00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:22.360 align:start position:0%
they're on so what I'm saying that the
 
00:12:24.949 --> 00:12:24.959 align:start position:0%
the impact of and and what's been going
 
00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:27.880 align:start position:0%
on um in regards to to bail and what
 
00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:30.240 align:start position:0%
we're seeing and the impacts at the
 
00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
level of the stakeholders in the county
 
00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:37.240 align:start position:0%
jails is that um medical needs to be I
 
00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
Would S medical is something that you
 
00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
definitely need to be mindful of um and
 
00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:47.000 align:start position:0%
then also um in regards to in regards to
 
00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
the cost per day um that's the largest
 
00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
driving Factor I'm gonna I'm going to
 
00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
say that um my experience uh and I'm
 
00:12:58.069 --> 00:12:58.079 align:start position:0%
going to ask uh Lieutenant Kon to talk a
 
00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
little bit um um experience in regards
 
00:13:02.829 --> 00:13:02.839 align:start position:0%
to pre-trial Services hillsbor currently
 
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:04.720 align:start position:0%
does not have a pre-trial service
 
00:13:08.949 --> 00:13:08.959 align:start position:0%
program um my understanding is is that
 
00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
at one point it was there was talks
 
00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
about it um but at this point in time
 
00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
it's it really boils down to funding too
 
00:13:21.189 --> 00:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
as well um there's also a lot of other C
 
00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
uh pieces that have to be put in place
 
00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:26.440 align:start position:0%
with that such as who's revoking uh
 
00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:27.880 align:start position:0%
their their bail status while they're
 
00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
out on pre-trial
 
00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
um you know do correction officers
 
00:13:32.949 --> 00:13:32.959 align:start position:0%
actually have the authority to go out
 
00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:35.560 align:start position:0%
and and take somebody in that's on a
 
00:13:38.509 --> 00:13:38.519 align:start position:0%
pre-trial status um to my knowledge that
 
00:13:40.629 --> 00:13:40.639 align:start position:0%
there uh that
 
00:13:43.629 --> 00:13:43.639 align:start position:0%
isn't that there isn't any RSA or
 
00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:46.720 align:start position:0%
authority that we have to do that um you
 
00:13:48.509 --> 00:13:48.519 align:start position:0%
know so there's a lot of mechanisms and
 
00:13:50.069 --> 00:13:50.079 align:start position:0%
Staffing that would need to be put in
 
00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
place too in regards to that which all
 
00:13:53.629 --> 00:13:53.639 align:start position:0%
boils down to one thing and that's
 
00:13:56.949 --> 00:13:56.959 align:start position:0%
funding so is it something that um the
 
00:13:59.590 --> 00:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
county would um
 
00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
uh look at in the future I that is
 
00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
something that I would request that we
 
00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:05.240 align:start position:0%
respectfully have to have a conversation
 
00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
with our commissioners and with our
 
00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:09.320 align:start position:0%
funding Authority the delegation and the
 
00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:11.320 align:start position:0%
executive committee
 
00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:13.880 align:start position:0%
um currently right now we do have I know
 
00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
there was questions about electronic
 
00:14:17.069 --> 00:14:17.079 align:start position:0%
monitoring programs and so forth um
 
00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
electronic monitoring for us right now
 
00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:22.120 align:start position:0%
we utilize it for sentence individuals
 
00:14:24.269 --> 00:14:24.279 align:start position:0%
um individuals who are on our programs
 
00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:26.959 align:start position:0%
and out in the community we monitor them
 
00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:29.720 align:start position:0%
in the community it costs us uh
 
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
roughly $6 and I think
 
00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
37 if you just remind me for a second I
 
00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:39.160 align:start position:0%
actually have the number right here
 
00:14:42.189 --> 00:14:42.199 align:start position:0%
um costs us I'm
 
00:14:45.189 --> 00:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
$685 per day to keep that monitor on
 
00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:47.480 align:start position:0%
that individual so obviously there's a
 
00:14:50.629 --> 00:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
shared cost that's associated with that
 
00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
um so we obvious the the individual
 
00:14:55.629 --> 00:14:55.639 align:start position:0%
that's out has to repay that cost while
 
00:14:59.710 --> 00:14:59.720 align:start position:0%
they're out now there is um
 
00:15:01.389 --> 00:15:01.399 align:start position:0%
that doesn't sound like a lot but when
 
00:15:03.389 --> 00:15:03.399 align:start position:0%
we talk about re-entry and putting
 
00:15:05.749 --> 00:15:05.759 align:start position:0%
people back into the community holding
 
00:15:05.759 --> 00:15:07.230 align:start position:0%
people back into the community holding
stable

00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:07.240 align:start position:0%
stable
 
00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:11.160 align:start position:0%
jobs um especially those who are um
 
00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
experiencing substance misuse uh that
 
00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:16.240 align:start position:0%
can be challenging that can be very
 
00:15:19.749 --> 00:15:19.759 align:start position:0%
challenging um so I guess that's a brief
 
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
overview I mean I'd be happy to answer
 
00:15:24.389 --> 00:15:24.399 align:start position:0%
any questions um I can ask Lieutenant
 
00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
conine I know some of the questions were
 
00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:27.880 align:start position:0%
how do we interact directly with the
 
00:15:30.309 --> 00:15:30.319 align:start position:0%
bail system so those in those
 
00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:32.240 align:start position:0%
individuals that are come into our
 
00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:35.160 align:start position:0%
custody um you know we see we see a
 
00:15:38.189 --> 00:15:38.199 align:start position:0%
various range of preventative detention
 
00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:41.800 align:start position:0%
cash baales um we see a lot of PR baales
 
00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:43.880 align:start position:0%
um and we're seeing a lot of repeat
 
00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:47.000 align:start position:0%
individuals coming back in um and as I
 
00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:50.120 align:start position:0%
said their their condition has just
 
00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:53.160 align:start position:0%
worsened over time um which eventually
 
00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
by the time they hit that Mark of
 
00:15:59.030 --> 00:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
they're being held for a period of time
 
00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
um again they're on pre- child status
 
00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
but they're they've reached a mark where
 
00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:05.240 align:start position:0%
they're they're definitely going to be
 
00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
more costly than than they ever have
 
00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
been um and that's just uh my
 
00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:12.040 align:start position:0%
observations as a correction
 
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
professional and as an expert in
 
00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
Corrections um it's I think that just
 
00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:20.600 align:start position:0%
needs to be noted so do you have any you
 
00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:22.600 align:start position:0%
to talk about how we interact with the
 
00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:24.990 align:start position:0%
to talk about how we interact with the
bill

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:25.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:28.069 --> 00:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
system uh yeah so right now I know one
 
00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
of the problems we're facing with the
 
00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
bail system is the lack of available
 
00:16:33.749 --> 00:16:33.759 align:start position:0%
bail Commissioners that are online on
 
00:16:36.069 --> 00:16:36.079 align:start position:0%
any given day I know we have a handful
 
00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
that we use at our facility and we are
 
00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:39.800 align:start position:0%
frequently run into problems where we
 
00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
have to redirect people to the courts to
 
00:16:44.509 --> 00:16:44.519 align:start position:0%
have bails posted rather than being able
 
00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
to call a bail commissioner down to the
 
00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:47.480 align:start position:0%
jail to post it because there's just no
 
00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
one available sometimes uh we have a
 
00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
good relationship with the bail
 
00:16:52.629 --> 00:16:52.639 align:start position:0%
Commissioners so sometimes we can get a
 
00:16:54.509 --> 00:16:54.519 align:start position:0%
hold of them and have them volunteer to
 
00:16:56.389 --> 00:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
come in on days they're not necessarily
 
00:16:58.670 --> 00:16:58.680 align:start position:0%
working that has been a hangup with the
 
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
bail process as it stands now and I know
 
00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
there's several reasons for that for the
 
00:17:06.669 --> 00:17:06.679 align:start position:0%
lack of bail Commissioners I'm sure they
 
00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
can speak more to that um than I could
 
00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
but that is probably our biggest hang up
 
00:17:14.429 --> 00:17:14.439 align:start position:0%
with people who are actually being held
 
00:17:17.029 --> 00:17:17.039 align:start position:0%
in jail getting out I know we've we're
 
00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:19.640 align:start position:0%
seeing more PR baales come in and go out
 
00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:21.839 align:start position:0%
than I have at any other time in my
 
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
18year career seems like it's often the
 
00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
same people you know once a week we see
 
00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:28.520 align:start position:0%
them we say goodbye to them we see them
 
00:17:30.029 --> 00:17:30.039 align:start position:0%
again the next week it's just in and out
 
00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:31.880 align:start position:0%
and as he said I think that's leading
 
00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:34.720 align:start position:0%
towards a lot more medical issues I
 
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
think years ago it used to be a rarity
 
00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:38.480 align:start position:0%
that we'd send somebody out to the
 
00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:41.320 align:start position:0%
hospital or not accept someone at intake
 
00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
and now it's just we know these people
 
00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:45.080 align:start position:0%
and they come back and we know as he
 
00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:46.280 align:start position:0%
said the conditions are just getting
 
00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:48.520 align:start position:0%
worse and worse so it's um they're
 
00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:50.360 align:start position:0%
coming in they're being deflected before
 
00:17:51.549 --> 00:17:51.559 align:start position:0%
they even get they have to get medically
 
00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:53.200 align:start position:0%
cleared with us before they come in so
 
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
the police departments are have to take
 
00:17:57.310 --> 00:17:57.320 align:start position:0%
them over and we have to try and arrange
 
00:17:59.630 --> 00:17:59.640 align:start position:0%
the arrangments with the courts and get
 
00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
that settled and then we go through the
 
00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
whole process of getting them stabilized
 
00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
and back and then it's another PR bail
 
00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
and they're back out on the street and
 
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
repeating that cycle over and over again
 
00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
more often um one of the things um and
 
00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:15.640 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you ask some questions but
 
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
obviously with the felony felony first
 
00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:19.640 align:start position:0%
roll back um that's going to bring on
 
00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:21.240 align:start position:0%
some drastic changes as well we've
 
00:18:24.029 --> 00:18:24.039 align:start position:0%
already began our meetings with um with
 
00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:26.360 align:start position:0%
the uh public defender's office or
 
00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
excuse me with the um Clerk's of Court's
 
00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
office and I have a couple meetings with
 
00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
my local public heads of local public
 
00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:34.600 align:start position:0%
defenders office um I know the head of
 
00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
the public defenders office is in the
 
00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
back right there so um and just trying
 
00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:40.120 align:start position:0%
to navigate that process it's going to
 
00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:42.520 align:start position:0%
go essentially back to the way it used
 
00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
to be um so obviously there's going to
 
00:18:49.789 --> 00:18:49.799 align:start position:0%
be some changes in that status and that
 
00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
will affect us as well too and
 
00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:54.200 align:start position:0%
operationally so how do you see that
 
00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.310 align:start position:0%
operationally so how do you see that
affecting

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
affecting
 
00:18:58.950 --> 00:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
you uh I I I think there's going to be a
 
00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:00.720 align:start position:0%
there's obviously going to be a lot more
 
00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
um in and out um I think there's going
 
00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:05.320 align:start position:0%
to be um individuals when you're when
 
00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
you're doing the baales at the um when
 
00:19:10.149 --> 00:19:10.159 align:start position:0%
they're seeing at the circuit court
 
00:19:13.029 --> 00:19:13.039 align:start position:0%
level um a lot of those charges are
 
00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:15.240 align:start position:0%
going to get kicked up to the felony
 
00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
level um we could see our population
 
00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
increase um but we could ALS it's hard
 
00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:23.240 align:start position:0%
to say put my thumb on exactly what's
 
00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
going to happen
 
00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:28.720 align:start position:0%
but it affects us also TimeWise right
 
00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
now if you look at a county like
 
00:19:32.909 --> 00:19:32.919 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro I mean the other day we had
 
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
for example we had 30 roughly process 30
 
00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
people in and out in one day that's
 
00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
staff intensive that's I mean it it is
 
00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
it's our job it's what we do um you know
 
00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
video arraignments um we we have the
 
00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:49.960 align:start position:0%
capability of doing video arraignments
 
00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:53.080 align:start position:0%
now um you know when you talk about two
 
00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
of the largest cities in in New
 
00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Manchester and nashwa feeding
 
00:19:59.510 --> 00:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
into one County Jail
 
00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
all those arraignments are are going to
 
00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
happen roughly probably within the same
 
00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:05.960 align:start position:0%
time frame and that'll be tasking on us
 
00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:07.640 align:start position:0%
not only tasking on us but'll be tasking
 
00:20:09.909 --> 00:20:09.919 align:start position:0%
on the public defenders as well too so
 
00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
that's how we see it impacting us so do
 
00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
you have how many rooms do you have
 
00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:16.600 align:start position:0%
available to conduct video arraignments
 
00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:19.720 align:start position:0%
uh we have two designated rooms um that
 
00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
we have to conduct actually they're
 
00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
getting rebuilt right now um to be able
 
00:20:25.909 --> 00:20:25.919 align:start position:0%
to conduct that but we also we utilize
 
00:20:27.549 --> 00:20:27.559 align:start position:0%
tablets um we can do them right on the
 
00:20:31.149 --> 00:20:31.159 align:start position:0%
housing units so um we've taken some
 
00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:33.720 align:start position:0%
large steps in in that technology
 
00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
advancement over the years and um gotten
 
00:20:38.149 --> 00:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
creative in that way but that still
 
00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:40.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't negate the fact that obviously
 
00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
those individuals are going to need to
 
00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:43.720 align:start position:0%
meet with counsel prior to it so we need
 
00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:46.640 align:start position:0%
to have be mindful of that and and
 
00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:48.280 align:start position:0%
letting the council get in and speak
 
00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
with them prior to the hearing and and
 
00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:52.360 align:start position:0%
so forth so does council have the
 
00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
ability to also confer with them
 
00:20:56.789 --> 00:20:56.799 align:start position:0%
privately over a video if they're not
 
00:20:59.270 --> 00:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
able to make it into the jail for that
 
00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
currently right now um we've had cases
 
00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
where we've made we've made exceptions
 
00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
for that um one of the big issues that
 
00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:11.720 align:start position:0%
we've seen and I know and I I will speak
 
00:21:15.029 --> 00:21:15.039 align:start position:0%
from the doc's standpoint is if Council
 
00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:16.600 align:start position:0%
hadn't had a chance to speak with their
 
00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:18.520 align:start position:0%
client sometimes they have to ask
 
00:21:20.549 --> 00:21:20.559 align:start position:0%
everybody to step out of the courtroom
 
00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
and that just delays the process right
 
00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:26.600 align:start position:0%
so um that's not a practice that I think
 
00:21:28.789 --> 00:21:28.799 align:start position:0%
that the clerk's moving forward I think
 
00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
is is really good because or or is
 
00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
wanted because it's just going to
 
00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:35.080 align:start position:0%
continuously have delays so we need to
 
00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
be able to provide them the ability to
 
00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
come in and meet with their clients I'm
 
00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:41.200 align:start position:0%
sure obviously if that was the option
 
00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
and that was a there was a question
 
00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
about that we could work on making
 
00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
exceptions to that they do have access
 
00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:48.640 align:start position:0%
to call them um they have direct access
 
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
to call them there's a couple lines in
 
00:21:53.149 --> 00:21:53.159 align:start position:0%
the jails where they can call in also um
 
00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
they have access on their tablets where
 
00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:56.720 align:start position:0%
they can where they can reach right out
 
00:21:58.350 --> 00:21:58.360 align:start position:0%
to their public defender and speak to
 
00:21:59.590 --> 00:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
them prior
 
00:22:02.669 --> 00:22:02.679 align:start position:0%
so okay so um thank you I have just a
 
00:22:04.549 --> 00:22:04.559 align:start position:0%
few questions so when you talk about
 
00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
medical costs uh being the real driving
 
00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
Factor what what kind of medical
 
00:22:09.909 --> 00:22:09.919 align:start position:0%
conditions are we talking mostly mental
 
00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:13.640 align:start position:0%
health or what's the big biggest driver
 
00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:16.760 align:start position:0%
uh so the the biggest driver that we're
 
00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:20.440 align:start position:0%
seeing is obviously mental health is is
 
00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:22.480 align:start position:0%
um a large driver substance substance
 
00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
misuse is a large driver um but what
 
00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
we're seeing medical conditions
 
00:22:31.029 --> 00:22:31.039 align:start position:0%
individual was coming in with um is
 
00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
infections um which are requiring
 
00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
significant hospital treatment because
 
00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
they haven't been treated prior to
 
00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:40.720 align:start position:0%
coming in um and they just let lapse um
 
00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
like sepsis type sepsis is large one um
 
00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
you're you're seeing um people's uh
 
00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
communicable diseases um
 
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.190 align:start position:0%
communicable diseases um
HIV

00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:54.200 align:start position:0%
HIV
 
00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
um there's there's numerous just chronic
 
00:22:59.149 --> 00:22:59.159 align:start position:0%
conditions that have never been treated
 
00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:01.240 align:start position:0%
over the years or have been neglected
 
00:23:05.669 --> 00:23:05.679 align:start position:0%
over the years um that just lead to
 
00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
organ failure um can so many different
 
00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:11.080 align:start position:0%
things just everything that you can
 
00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:14.360 align:start position:0%
imagine you can imagine um we've seen it
 
00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
and when we say that we then we see
 
00:23:20.149 --> 00:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
something else so so um how do you
 
00:23:21.789 --> 00:23:21.799 align:start position:0%
screen that obviously you can't just
 
00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:23.240 align:start position:0%
look at someone and see that they are
 
00:23:26.269 --> 00:23:26.279 align:start position:0%
HIV um how do you how do you get to that
 
00:23:28.549 --> 00:23:28.559 align:start position:0%
process when are they screened So
 
00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:30.440 align:start position:0%
currently right now um Hillsboro County
 
00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:32.440 align:start position:0%
has brought in a new medical provider so
 
00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
we share the same medical provider as
 
00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
Rockingham Carrol County belnap County
 
00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:39.720 align:start position:0%
Marat County um but even prior to that
 
00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:42.200 align:start position:0%
they're screened at intake so as the PD
 
00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
arrives at the facility um be prior to
 
00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
admittance they're screened um if
 
00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
there's a there's criteria that we look
 
00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
for um say the individual is in a car
 
00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:55.640 align:start position:0%
accident or so forth they're they're
 
00:23:57.269 --> 00:23:57.279 align:start position:0%
unstable in their feet they have a head
 
00:24:00.789 --> 00:24:00.799 align:start position:0%
injury they have open sores open wounds
 
00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
um we require them to be cleared by the
 
00:24:05.909 --> 00:24:05.919 align:start position:0%
hospital prior to incarceration still
 
00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
they're going to come back to the to the
 
00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:09.720 align:start position:0%
jail um and then there's a medical
 
00:24:13.149 --> 00:24:13.159 align:start position:0%
intake that's done um within the first
 
00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:16.240 align:start position:0%
uh four hours now the medical intake is
 
00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
done um at the facility an initial
 
00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:22.240 align:start position:0%
triage medical intake and then within 48
 
00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
Hours they've had their medical intake
 
00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:27.240 align:start position:0%
done how do you handle people that come
 
00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
in um who have mental health issues who
 
00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
have been like for example some with
 
00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
schizophrenia who's off their meds how
 
00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
do you how do you deal with
 
00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:39.240 align:start position:0%
that it's definitely a difficult um you
 
00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
know I can't commend our staff enough um
 
00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
and and correction officers all over the
 
00:24:45.669 --> 00:24:45.679 align:start position:0%
state um just dealing with these
 
00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
individuals that are in crisis
 
00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:51.880 align:start position:0%
um it's it's unfortunate um but you know
 
00:24:55.789 --> 00:24:55.799 align:start position:0%
between utilization of CIT Crisis
 
00:24:58.669 --> 00:24:58.679 align:start position:0%
Intervention techniques and and
 
00:25:01.389 --> 00:25:01.399 align:start position:0%
um trauma informed training um our staff
 
00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
have been able to deescalate those types
 
00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:06.440 align:start position:0%
of situations jails aren't treat jails
 
00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:09.080 align:start position:0%
aren't established to be long-term care
 
00:25:11.269 --> 00:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
facilities for individuals with mental
 
00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:13.480 align:start position:0%
health it's not what we do we're our
 
00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:15.880 align:start position:0%
we're establish what we do is triage and
 
00:25:18.149 --> 00:25:18.159 align:start position:0%
stabilize until they can require the
 
00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
proper necessary care whether it be at
 
00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:23.320 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire state hospital or um
 
00:25:25.389 --> 00:25:25.399 align:start position:0%
sometimes the the secure psychiatric
 
00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:29.080 align:start position:0%
unit um but in the meantime obviously
 
00:25:31.389 --> 00:25:31.399 align:start position:0%
we're the first stop uh unfortunately
 
00:25:34.029 --> 00:25:34.039 align:start position:0%
jails in the country have become
 
00:25:36.789 --> 00:25:36.799 align:start position:0%
warehouses um for those um who are in
 
00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:38.840 align:start position:0%
crisis and suffering from mental health
 
00:25:41.909 --> 00:25:41.919 align:start position:0%
um and the way that we process it and
 
00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:43.720 align:start position:0%
the way that we deal with it is you know
 
00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:46.640 align:start position:0%
we have clinicians on staff um our nurse
 
00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
our medical provider um we continue
 
00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
medications we get them started on
 
00:25:53.549 --> 00:25:53.559 align:start position:0%
medications they meet with the provider
 
00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:55.480 align:start position:0%
um they meet with our psychiatric uh
 
00:25:58.549 --> 00:25:58.559 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioner um and that we do all
 
00:26:00.149 --> 00:26:00.159 align:start position:0%
that via video too we can do that we
 
00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:01.880 align:start position:0%
have the ability to do tele medicine too
 
00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
now so um that's how we um interact with
 
00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:08.200 align:start position:0%
those individuals coming in so and it
 
00:26:10.029 --> 00:26:10.039 align:start position:0%
takes a lot of patience with our staff
 
00:26:12.909 --> 00:26:12.919 align:start position:0%
too as well and connecting to make sure
 
00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
that we're not escalating them in their
 
00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
Crist in their state and also providing
 
00:26:20.029 --> 00:26:20.039 align:start position:0%
them uh a safe environment as well for
 
00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:22.240 align:start position:0%
our staff a safe environment so do you
 
00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
have facilities to hold someone where
 
00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
they can be safely held without hurting
 
00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
themselves if they are in the mental
 
00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:32.120 align:start position:0%
um Mental Health crisis uh without using
 
00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:35.360 align:start position:0%
like padded room I mean something so we
 
00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
do have we do have areas that that
 
00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:40.360 align:start position:0%
provide more observation for individuals
 
00:26:43.789 --> 00:26:43.799 align:start position:0%
um such as larger lexand cell doors um
 
00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:46.440 align:start position:0%
we have protocols in place um for those
 
00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:48.760 align:start position:0%
who are who are experiencing um
 
00:26:51.909 --> 00:26:51.919 align:start position:0%
self-injurious behavior um and
 
00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
requirements of what they would for
 
00:26:56.909 --> 00:26:56.919 align:start position:0%
clothing food uh how they're how they're
 
00:26:59.190 --> 00:26:59.200 align:start position:0%
their process processed um interacting
 
00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
with staff um so we have secured cells
 
00:27:05.549 --> 00:27:05.559 align:start position:0%
that that obviously we can we can
 
00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:08.840 align:start position:0%
utilize yeah have you um or are you
 
00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
aware of any way for you to um recoup
 
00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:13.960 align:start position:0%
some of your medical expenses if the if
 
00:27:15.789 --> 00:27:15.799 align:start position:0%
the if the person has for example
 
00:27:18.389 --> 00:27:18.399 align:start position:0%
Medicare Medicaid to Bill to get back
 
00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:22.760 align:start position:0%
for some of that so thankfully when an
 
00:27:25.269 --> 00:27:25.279 align:start position:0%
individual leaves our custody right so
 
00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
if they go to the hospital um
 
00:27:30.909 --> 00:27:30.919 align:start position:0%
we can turn their insurance on they have
 
00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
to be admitted though what we see a lot
 
00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
and I will speak very candidly about
 
00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
this is they get placed in an
 
00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:40.120 align:start position:0%
observation period and we can't recoup
 
00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:42.360 align:start position:0%
during that observation period however
 
00:27:45.149 --> 00:27:45.159 align:start position:0%
if they're admitted to the hospital um
 
00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:47.320 align:start position:0%
the state has worked with us and and
 
00:27:49.509 --> 00:27:49.519 align:start position:0%
their Medicaid will cover their their
 
00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:52.240 align:start position:0%
Hospital costs so it's only if they're
 
00:27:53.789 --> 00:27:53.799 align:start position:0%
admitted though other than that when
 
00:27:55.789 --> 00:27:55.799 align:start position:0%
they come in their insurance turns off
 
00:27:57.710 --> 00:27:57.720 align:start position:0%
when they leave their insurance we turn
 
00:28:00.029 --> 00:28:00.039 align:start position:0%
their insurance back on for them and
 
00:28:02.710 --> 00:28:02.720 align:start position:0%
obviously as uh most of you are probably
 
00:28:04.789 --> 00:28:04.799 align:start position:0%
familiar with this has been a Hot Topic
 
00:28:07.509 --> 00:28:07.519 align:start position:0%
over the years in regards to insurance
 
00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:15.240 align:start position:0%
that's it would require the federal
 
00:28:17.789 --> 00:28:17.799 align:start position:0%
government to pass a law that would not
 
00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh that would allow you to continue
 
00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:21.320 align:start position:0%
billing medic even if they're Insurance
 
00:28:22.789 --> 00:28:22.799 align:start position:0%
because it seems like that law was
 
00:28:24.789 --> 00:28:24.799 align:start position:0%
designed to penalize people for going to
 
00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:26.320 align:start position:0%
jail but if it's a mental health thing
 
00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:28.120 align:start position:0%
that drove them to jail cutting off
 
00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:29.960 align:start position:0%
their insurance seems counterintuitive
 
00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
the cost is shifted down onto the
 
00:28:33.389 --> 00:28:33.399 align:start position:0%
counties at this point do you get any
 
00:28:35.269 --> 00:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
money from the state to to recoup any of
 
00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
these expenses any specifically in
 
00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
regards to mental health I could tell
 
00:28:42.029 --> 00:28:42.039 align:start position:0%
you right now we anything yeah um we we
 
00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:46.440 align:start position:0%
applied for um uh the opioid funds um
 
00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
this year and we were awarded some
 
00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:51.200 align:start position:0%
reimbursement um prior to this as well
 
00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:53.240 align:start position:0%
too U prior to me getting there there
 
00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:55.480 align:start position:0%
was a there was a sum of money that the
 
00:28:57.549 --> 00:28:57.559 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro County was awarded um and we
 
00:29:00.149 --> 00:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
just um we're in the final stages it's
 
00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:04.360 align:start position:0%
going to GNC um I think November 3rd I
 
00:29:06.269 --> 00:29:06.279 align:start position:0%
think is the next meeting so there was a
 
00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:08.320 align:start position:0%
recruitment that we applied for for a
 
00:29:11.549 --> 00:29:11.559 align:start position:0%
three-year period for for funds yes
 
00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:13.480 align:start position:0%
would it fully reimburse you or only a
 
00:29:16.389 --> 00:29:16.399 align:start position:0%
little bit or no it it would reimburse
 
00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
such costs as medical assisted treatment
 
00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:23.080 align:start position:0%
um cost of some of our uh staff time
 
00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:26.200 align:start position:0%
there's a percentage of it um but mostly
 
00:29:28.149 --> 00:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
it was surrounding around the cost for
 
00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:31.640 align:start position:0%
our providers to provide the medic uh
 
00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:33.720 align:start position:0%
medic medication assistant treatment in
 
00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:37.000 align:start position:0%
the facility so when you mentioned a a a
 
00:29:38.669 --> 00:29:38.679 align:start position:0%
person who might cost you
 
00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:41.960 align:start position:0%
$30,000 um are you talking like a person
 
00:29:44.149 --> 00:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
with meds like who's on HIV you has to
 
00:29:46.509 --> 00:29:46.519 align:start position:0%
take a serious a lot of you can look at
 
00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:48.360 align:start position:0%
a med like I we've all seen the
 
00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:50.120 align:start position:0%
commercials for it you look at you look
 
00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:52.600 align:start position:0%
at a med like Humera those are those are
 
00:29:59.590 --> 00:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:02.789 --> 00:30:02.799 align:start position:0%
I think I forget the I'm sorry but you
 
00:30:04.789 --> 00:30:04.799 align:start position:0%
took a med like that you know on this on
 
00:30:07.029 --> 00:30:07.039 align:start position:0%
the street it's and when I say on the
 
00:30:09.389 --> 00:30:09.399 align:start position:0%
street I mean outside of the jail if you
 
00:30:10.789 --> 00:30:10.799 align:start position:0%
don't have insurance on it it's about
 
00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:15.320 align:start position:0%
$30,000 a month so um we could go to the
 
00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:17.200 align:start position:0%
provider you know we all have insurance
 
00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:18.760 align:start position:0%
and and we go to the provider we pay
 
00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:21.880 align:start position:0%
like $40 but those individuals that it's
 
00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
a it's a very expensive cost so so you
 
00:30:28.789 --> 00:30:28.799 align:start position:0%
pay full price if we we would yeah yeah
 
00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:31.000 align:start position:0%
um do you have you tried reaching out to
 
00:30:33.509 --> 00:30:33.519 align:start position:0%
any of the pharmaceutical companies and
 
00:30:35.870 --> 00:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
had any success with
 
00:30:39.909 --> 00:30:39.919 align:start position:0%
them so we utilize um uh like currently
 
00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
right now um our medical provider um has
 
00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
a pharmacy that they utilize Westwood um
 
00:30:48.149 --> 00:30:48.159 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy is is what they do um there's
 
00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
other jails there's other other jails
 
00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:53.440 align:start position:0%
use different pharmacies um it all
 
00:30:56.549 --> 00:30:56.559 align:start position:0%
depends you know on what the cost is you
 
00:30:58.710 --> 00:30:58.720 align:start position:0%
go out to RF we utilize the RFP process
 
00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:00.760 align:start position:0%
for that as well yeah to get the best
 
00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:03.240 align:start position:0%
price um on those medications a lot of
 
00:31:06.269 --> 00:31:06.279 align:start position:0%
the a lot of the companies have um are
 
00:31:10.269 --> 00:31:10.279 align:start position:0%
able to restock um unused medications um
 
00:31:12.789 --> 00:31:12.799 align:start position:0%
which provides us a kickback obviously
 
00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
and and uh reimbursement so okay um my
 
00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
next question was
 
00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
regarding tracking of of do you have any
 
00:31:26.549 --> 00:31:26.559 align:start position:0%
ability to track if someone is let go on
 
00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:29.080 align:start position:0%
PR and they come back 3 or 4 days later
 
00:31:30.789 --> 00:31:30.799 align:start position:0%
are you able to track those numbers of
 
00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:33.200 align:start position:0%
people who who reoffend and come back in
 
00:31:35.269 --> 00:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
while they're on an original
 
00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
bail uh we can sorry we can certainly
 
00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
track an individual who's releasing when
 
00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:42.200 align:start position:0%
they come back in you know based on that
 
00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
um just their inmate number we can see
 
00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
how many times they've been back and how
 
00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
recently as far as just a general
 
00:31:52.549 --> 00:31:52.559 align:start position:0%
tracking of whether or not there unless
 
00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:55.000 align:start position:0%
we're specifically looking for it um it
 
00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be wouldn't necessarily come up
 
00:31:58.669 --> 00:31:58.679 align:start position:0%
once are on PR bail they're out of our
 
00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
system we're not tracking them at that
 
00:32:03.549 --> 00:32:03.559 align:start position:0%
point so there's it's not a like I
 
00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
couldn't pull you a number right now and
 
00:32:06.549 --> 00:32:06.559 align:start position:0%
see how many inmates we've released on
 
00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
PR bail that are still out on PR bail
 
00:32:10.629 --> 00:32:10.639 align:start position:0%
and or how many times they've come back
 
00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
well out on bail so would your system be
 
00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:14.720 align:start position:0%
able to do that if that were something
 
00:32:16.990 --> 00:32:17.000 align:start position:0%
that were
 
00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:20.120 align:start position:0%
required it could it could assist with
 
00:32:22.789 --> 00:32:22.799 align:start position:0%
that um just so that we would be able to
 
00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:24.760 align:start position:0%
get a number in the future like over a
 
00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
year how many people are let out and
 
00:32:28.149 --> 00:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
then come back within while they're
 
00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
still on the original bail yeah we could
 
00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
use the system as well as some other
 
00:32:34.549 --> 00:32:34.559 align:start position:0%
resources that we wouldn't have to use
 
00:32:36.549 --> 00:32:36.559 align:start position:0%
to to track that information but that
 
00:32:38.909 --> 00:32:38.919 align:start position:0%
that could be done over um if it was
 
00:32:41.629 --> 00:32:41.639 align:start position:0%
done intentionally over a period of time
 
00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
okay yeah I asked because I don't want
 
00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:45.080 align:start position:0%
to mandate something that can't be done
 
00:32:48.549 --> 00:32:48.559 align:start position:0%
without funds so um go ahead you wanted
 
00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:51.440 align:start position:0%
to say something yeah um one of the
 
00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
things I would note with that is that um
 
00:32:57.149 --> 00:32:57.159 align:start position:0%
those arrested in other counties so we
 
00:32:59.750 --> 00:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
won't know necessarily that somebody was
 
00:33:02.629 --> 00:33:02.639 align:start position:0%
arrested in Rockingham County yeah um
 
00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:04.200 align:start position:0%
and and we see that when we do our
 
00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
recidivism numbers for like our
 
00:33:08.509 --> 00:33:08.519 align:start position:0%
programming and so forth um because the
 
00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
national average I believe is around 60%
 
00:33:13.389 --> 00:33:13.399 align:start position:0%
and then um you know for a place like
 
00:33:15.029 --> 00:33:15.039 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro County when I we did a
 
00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:17.960 align:start position:0%
recidivism study this past year um in
 
00:33:20.110 --> 00:33:20.120 align:start position:0%
our program uh we're sitting about
 
00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
anywhere from in three-year period 27 to
 
00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
30% re civism those are sentenced
 
00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:26.440 align:start position:0%
individuals that re offended within one
 
00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
year coming back to the facility and
 
00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:31.480 align:start position:0%
Lieutenant conine is our data individual
 
00:33:33.310 --> 00:33:33.320 align:start position:0%
so he's the best person for us to be
 
00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:35.720 align:start position:0%
asking this question of right now so I
 
00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:38.120 align:start position:0%
want to keep in touch with you yeah um
 
00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
he but to track that within our County I
 
00:33:43.389 --> 00:33:43.399 align:start position:0%
mean it would take some leg work on on
 
00:33:46.669 --> 00:33:46.679 align:start position:0%
our end but um he'd be happy to take a
 
00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:49.000 align:start position:0%
look I'm sure in the if you could if
 
00:33:50.549 --> 00:33:50.559 align:start position:0%
it's possible I don't want to ask you to
 
00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:52.600 align:start position:0%
move their world but if it's if some
 
00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
retooling of the of the system is
 
00:33:56.230 --> 00:33:56.240 align:start position:0%
possible so that you could track
 
00:33:57.710 --> 00:33:57.720 align:start position:0%
individuals who came back while they
 
00:34:00.789 --> 00:34:00.799 align:start position:0%
were out on bail so we would have harder
 
00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:03.240 align:start position:0%
numbers on that
 
00:34:07.069 --> 00:34:07.079 align:start position:0%
um let me see
 
00:34:10.149 --> 00:34:10.159 align:start position:0%
um with regard to you said that you have
 
00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:11.560 align:start position:0%
some difficulty getting bail
 
00:34:15.430 --> 00:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
Commissioners um is that something new
 
00:34:16.909 --> 00:34:16.919 align:start position:0%
that's getting worse or is it something
 
00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
that's kind of been steady in the county
 
00:34:22.470 --> 00:34:22.480 align:start position:0%
uh it started we used to have I going to
 
00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
say a couple years ago we used to have a
 
00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner on 247 that we can get
 
00:34:28.149 --> 00:34:28.159 align:start position:0%
a hold of we share of bail commission
 
00:34:30.349 --> 00:34:30.359 align:start position:0%
with Manchester PD so they would swing
 
00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
back and forth between each of those and
 
00:34:34.990 --> 00:34:35.000 align:start position:0%
probably starting within the last Sor
 
00:34:37.389 --> 00:34:37.399 align:start position:0%
just time blurs together so sometime in
 
00:34:41.629 --> 00:34:41.639 align:start position:0%
the last couple years it's it went from
 
00:34:43.349 --> 00:34:43.359 align:start position:0%
us occasionally having a day where we
 
00:34:45.909 --> 00:34:45.919 align:start position:0%
had no bail commissioner on to it's ebed
 
00:34:48.430 --> 00:34:48.440 align:start position:0%
and Float a little bit to we oftentimes
 
00:34:50.149 --> 00:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
have multiple days a week where we have
 
00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:52.440 align:start position:0%
no bail commissioner available would
 
00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
that be over a weekend that you're
 
00:34:56.990 --> 00:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
talking about mostly very candidly at
 
00:34:58.790 --> 00:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
like to say this one of my one of the
 
00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:01.480 align:start position:0%
things I noticed one day um like over
 
00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:04.280 align:start position:0%
Memorial Day weekend I believe it was um
 
00:35:05.829 --> 00:35:05.839 align:start position:0%
I think I want to say it was memor the
 
00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
weekend there wasn't a bail commissioner
 
00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:11.480 align:start position:0%
on from Thursday till I think Tuesday of
 
00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:14.240 align:start position:0%
the following week so we didn't have
 
00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:16.200 align:start position:0%
anybody that we could call and that's
 
00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
not only frustrating for for us it's
 
00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
frustrating for the the I would assume
 
00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:23.720 align:start position:0%
and I want to speak for them the public
 
00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:27.640 align:start position:0%
defender office um as well too um and
 
00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
and also the PDS um because people are
 
00:35:33.349 --> 00:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
on vacation and that's what people do
 
00:35:35.950 --> 00:35:35.960 align:start position:0%
people take vacations and um when
 
00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
there's only a limited amount of bail
 
00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:40.680 align:start position:0%
Commissioners that's that so that whole
 
00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
weekend people that would normally be
 
00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
entitled to bail had to sit in jail the
 
00:35:46.870 --> 00:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
entire weekend we were I think we were
 
00:35:48.109 --> 00:35:48.119 align:start position:0%
able to get a hold of a bail
 
00:35:51.109 --> 00:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
commissioner um in a couple couple
 
00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:53.560 align:start position:0%
accounts but again they would either sit
 
00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
with us or they'd sit with the PD yeah
 
00:35:58.150 --> 00:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
so if they have a holding facility
 
00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:00.520 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to ask that everybody in a
 
00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:02.030 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to ask that everybody in a
second

00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
um with regard to electronic monitoring
 
00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
do you see any bail Commissioners ever
 
00:36:08.829 --> 00:36:08.839 align:start position:0%
Avail themselves of that as a condition
 
00:36:08.839 --> 00:36:11.230 align:start position:0%
Avail themselves of that as a condition
of

00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:11.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
bail and if so who would uh who would
 
00:36:16.990 --> 00:36:17.000 align:start position:0%
monitor so we've seen it utilized the
 
00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
company I off the top what's
 
00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
theany Paris Bail Bonds out of
 
00:36:24.589 --> 00:36:24.599 align:start position:0%
Connecticut have done that has has done
 
00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
that in Hillsboro County um and they
 
00:36:29.470 --> 00:36:29.480 align:start position:0%
would up put a bracelet on um or they'
 
00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:30.760 align:start position:0%
have somebody in the area put a bracelet
 
00:36:32.309 --> 00:36:32.319 align:start position:0%
on them and monitor as a condition
 
00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:33.720 align:start position:0%
usually the condition comes down from
 
00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:36.040 align:start position:0%
the courts though okay that would be in
 
00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
a cash bail situation probably when they
 
00:36:40.589 --> 00:36:40.599 align:start position:0%
use the bail bonds out of conect yes
 
00:36:44.589 --> 00:36:44.599 align:start position:0%
okay if if it were utilized by bail
 
00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
Commissioners um as part of a PR
 
00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:53.200 align:start position:0%
bail um would would it still be the same
 
00:36:55.069 --> 00:36:55.079 align:start position:0%
687 a
 
00:36:58.230 --> 00:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
day that that cost cost varies um in my
 
00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
experience as throughout my career um
 
00:37:04.349 --> 00:37:04.359 align:start position:0%
again you go through it would all it
 
00:37:06.109 --> 00:37:06.119 align:start position:0%
would all depend on what that company
 
00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
chooses to charge them um and also
 
00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:13.240 align:start position:0%
whoever they're utilizing from like what
 
00:37:15.309 --> 00:37:15.319 align:start position:0%
monitoring system there's multiple ones
 
00:37:18.069 --> 00:37:18.079 align:start position:0%
there's Sentinel there's track group uh
 
00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:20.720 align:start position:0%
Omni link there's so many different um
 
00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:23.240 align:start position:0%
groups out there that do it um so it
 
00:37:25.309 --> 00:37:25.319 align:start position:0%
really would require who's given
 
00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
whatever price they're getting versus
 
00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:29.800 align:start position:0%
and versus how much they're charging so
 
00:37:31.829 --> 00:37:31.839 align:start position:0%
well the committee I mean candidly we're
 
00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:33.880 align:start position:0%
here because the public is is is
 
00:37:35.230 --> 00:37:35.240 align:start position:0%
expressed a certain level of
 
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
uncomfortableness with the number of
 
00:37:38.750 --> 00:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
people that are being bailed released
 
00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
bailed released and committing crimes
 
00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
while on bail and at the same time we're
 
00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:46.200 align:start position:0%
looking at how we can not say okay
 
00:37:47.829 --> 00:37:47.839 align:start position:0%
you're all going to be held at the
 
00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:50.720 align:start position:0%
expense of the county and also to
 
00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:52.640 align:start position:0%
disrupt people's lives
 
00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily I feel like um electronic
 
00:37:57.349 --> 00:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
monitoring implementation would be much
 
00:37:59.829 --> 00:37:59.839 align:start position:0%
cheaper to the county than having them
 
00:38:01.309 --> 00:38:01.319 align:start position:0%
stayed in there with all their medical
 
00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:03.560 align:start position:0%
expenses and everything else so we're
 
00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:05.560 align:start position:0%
trying to look at that as a possibility
 
00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
to versus just being held on certain
 
00:38:11.589 --> 00:38:11.599 align:start position:0%
crimes it definitely would be a cost
 
00:38:14.109 --> 00:38:14.119 align:start position:0%
shift on to the county um obviously with
 
00:38:16.109 --> 00:38:16.119 align:start position:0%
that because we require Staffing as well
 
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
too yeah um and you know one of the
 
00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
things that there's obviously would need
 
00:38:24.430 --> 00:38:24.440 align:start position:0%
to be conditions that would be met to
 
00:38:26.829 --> 00:38:26.839 align:start position:0%
put somebody out um in the community
 
00:38:28.990 --> 00:38:29.000 align:start position:0%
because you would still see the same
 
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
thing of them coming back and continuing
 
00:38:33.309 --> 00:38:33.319 align:start position:0%
to come back I it would need to be
 
00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:35.000 align:start position:0%
monitored while they're out there we
 
00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:37.280 align:start position:0%
have utilized it in instances very
 
00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:41.640 align:start position:0%
specific instances where um somebody's
 
00:38:45.030 --> 00:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
medical situation is so drastic that it
 
00:38:47.309 --> 00:38:47.319 align:start position:0%
would require hospitalization for an
 
00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
extended period of time we have um and
 
00:38:53.109 --> 00:38:53.119 align:start position:0%
the public defender office prosecution
 
00:38:55.790 --> 00:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
have have worked with us in order to um
 
00:38:57.910 --> 00:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
allow us to to put a bracelet on them
 
00:39:00.589 --> 00:39:00.599 align:start position:0%
and and keep them there which has shown
 
00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
a large um savings to the county so it
 
00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
does that's what I'm asking would it be
 
00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:09.160 align:start position:0%
would it be more cost effective for the
 
00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
county to hold somebody um hold them
 
00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:15.160 align:start position:0%
actually or to continue to let them on
 
00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:16.640 align:start position:0%
PR but with a
 
00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
monitor and it seems to me the monitor
 
00:39:21.470 --> 00:39:21.480 align:start position:0%
would be much more cost effective than
 
00:39:23.309 --> 00:39:23.319 align:start position:0%
again I think it would be I mean either
 
00:39:24.790 --> 00:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
one is going to cost you money either
 
00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:26.440 align:start position:0%
one's going to cost um it would defin
 
00:39:28.069 --> 00:39:28.079 align:start position:0%
definitely vary on the person on the
 
00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:30.160 align:start position:0%
individual too that's the hardest part
 
00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
to say will they obey other conditions
 
00:39:35.349 --> 00:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
regard yeah okay um questions from the
 
00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
roads thank you Mr chairman you had
 
00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned about the the lack of bell
 
00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:43.960 align:start position:0%
Commissioners it's not the first time
 
00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:45.400 align:start position:0%
we've heard that I'm sure you that you
 
00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
understand that H how many times or I
 
00:39:52.069 --> 00:39:52.079 align:start position:0%
guess how many attempts will you make to
 
00:39:54.270 --> 00:39:54.280 align:start position:0%
call a bill commissioner before you
 
00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
just you know like Hillsboro wow like
 
00:39:59.309 --> 00:39:59.319 align:start position:0%
you know how you know like are you doing
 
00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
this you know are you calling every hour
 
00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:02.480 align:start position:0%
are you just calling two or three like
 
00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:03.880 align:start position:0%
do you call two or three times and then
 
00:40:05.470 --> 00:40:05.480 align:start position:0%
that's it they what what would be your
 
00:40:08.109 --> 00:40:08.119 align:start position:0%
your Norm or your standard if we have a
 
00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:09.800 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner scheduled we'll call
 
00:40:11.309 --> 00:40:11.319 align:start position:0%
them repeatedly if we have no bail
 
00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner scheduled our first call is
 
00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
usually the Manchester Police Department
 
00:40:17.390 --> 00:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
to kind of see hey you got to see if
 
00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
they're using anyone if they've already
 
00:40:21.069 --> 00:40:21.079 align:start position:0%
talked to somebody who can come in um
 
00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:22.760 align:start position:0%
and after that if they say no we haven't
 
00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:26.640 align:start position:0%
used anyone then uh we'll kind of hold
 
00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
call some of the bail Commissioners that
 
00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:29.720 align:start position:0%
we know on their days off that aren't
 
00:40:30.990 --> 00:40:31.000 align:start position:0%
scheduled to see if they're available to
 
00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
come in and if they answer and agree to
 
00:40:35.829 --> 00:40:35.839 align:start position:0%
come in then that works out for us if we
 
00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
call around and we can't get through to
 
00:40:39.309 --> 00:40:39.319 align:start position:0%
anybody then there's nothing else we can
 
00:40:41.870 --> 00:40:41.880 align:start position:0%
really do at that point yeah we I found
 
00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
in my in my career too um you know
 
00:40:46.349 --> 00:40:46.359 align:start position:0%
there's certain there's certain bail
 
00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:49.640 align:start position:0%
Commissioners that you know that will go
 
00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:52.440 align:start position:0%
above and beyond and come in and you
 
00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:54.440 align:start position:0%
know as as you work in these agencies
 
00:40:56.670 --> 00:40:56.680 align:start position:0%
you develop that relationship with them
 
00:40:58.510 --> 00:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
and because our goal isn't to hold
 
00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
anybody um that that for bail that has
 
00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:03.960 align:start position:0%
the ability to get out on bail because
 
00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:06.440 align:start position:0%
again that becomes a cost for us it's
 
00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
there's potential liability associated
 
00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
with every individual that we house in
 
00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:12.440 align:start position:0%
custody too so if we can get them out we
 
00:41:14.589 --> 00:41:14.599 align:start position:0%
want to get them out
 
00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:18.640 align:start position:0%
so yeah just a follow up on her question
 
00:41:22.270 --> 00:41:22.280 align:start position:0%
do you have like a um in do do the bail
 
00:41:24.309 --> 00:41:24.319 align:start position:0%
Commissioners in your county do do they
 
00:41:26.309 --> 00:41:26.319 align:start position:0%
have like um like who's going to be
 
00:41:27.790 --> 00:41:27.800 align:start position:0%
covering this weekend or any type of
 
00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
that thing or is it just you just start
 
00:41:32.349 --> 00:41:32.359 align:start position:0%
calling on a list we they they send us a
 
00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
schedule uh monthly and then up you know
 
00:41:39.309 --> 00:41:39.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:43.160 align:start position:0%
to thank you how often are you seeing uh
 
00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
individuals with their bill being
 
00:41:46.589 --> 00:41:46.599 align:start position:0%
violated that are detained until they
 
00:41:51.309 --> 00:41:51.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:54.349 --> 00:41:54.359 align:start position:0%
levels they come in on VI on violations
 
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
of bail yeah they come in violation of
 
00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
bail they're bail has been violated they
 
00:41:59.470 --> 00:41:59.480 align:start position:0%
come back with either a cash bail from
 
00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
the court or they end up staying with
 
00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
you until they have trial is that
 
00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
something you're seeing a lot of
 
00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
recently or no uh we do
 
00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
have a good fair amount of individuals
 
00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:12.800 align:start position:0%
coming in with the breach of bail
 
00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
charges unfortunately I wouldn't feel
 
00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
comfortable giving you a number as far
 
00:42:19.630 --> 00:42:19.640 align:start position:0%
as how many of what what's that turns
 
00:42:22.030 --> 00:42:22.040 align:start position:0%
into after there rign i' have to it's
 
00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:23.640 align:start position:0%
not something I've necessarily looked at
 
00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:25.160 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:28.440 align:start position:0%
so just like to follow up on that um I
 
00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
will give you a number um I think it was
 
00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:34.400 align:start position:0%
at my last board meeting it was roughly
 
00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
I think 28 people that we had in custody
 
00:42:39.069 --> 00:42:39.079 align:start position:0%
that were in custody for over 365 days
 
00:42:39.079 --> 00:42:40.829 align:start position:0%
that were in custody for over 365 days
as

00:42:40.829 --> 00:42:40.839 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
pre-trial that's a lot of individuals
 
00:42:45.630 --> 00:42:45.640 align:start position:0%
and obviously there is a whole the whole
 
00:42:48.549 --> 00:42:48.559 align:start position:0%
court process with you know all the
 
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
court proceedings going on but that was
 
00:42:52.109 --> 00:42:52.119 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of individuals to be
 
00:42:54.349 --> 00:42:54.359 align:start position:0%
housing um jails aren't designed to
 
00:42:55.870 --> 00:42:55.880 align:start position:0%
House people longer than a year that's
 
00:42:59.190 --> 00:42:59.200 align:start position:0%
just not what we are so follow follow up
 
00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
I would assume those cases are probably
 
00:43:03.069 --> 00:43:03.079 align:start position:0%
felony level cases that are more serious
 
00:43:05.549 --> 00:43:05.559 align:start position:0%
in nature than Mr demeanors most of them
 
00:43:08.069 --> 00:43:08.079 align:start position:0%
yes right thank
 
00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
you any other questions from the
 
00:43:15.349 --> 00:43:15.359 align:start position:0%
committee representative wheeler I just
 
00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:17.160 align:start position:0%
missed the number when you had said it
 
00:43:19.150 --> 00:43:19.160 align:start position:0%
um what is the recidivism right for
 
00:43:21.309 --> 00:43:21.319 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro County again so if you look at
 
00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:23.200 align:start position:0%
the the national level I would say the
 
00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
national level roughly is around 60%
 
00:43:31.470 --> 00:43:31.480 align:start position:0%
65% um when you look at our program and
 
00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:33.240 align:start position:0%
I was talking specifically previously
 
00:43:36.109 --> 00:43:36.119 align:start position:0%
what was known as sacko um there were
 
00:43:38.190 --> 00:43:38.200 align:start position:0%
three-year recidivism studies so those
 
00:43:39.829 --> 00:43:39.839 align:start position:0%
individuals that were sentenced to our
 
00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
sacko program um and our our numbers are
 
00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:45.240 align:start position:0%
right on the website too so if you want
 
00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:46.640 align:start position:0%
to take a look at this all the data is
 
00:43:48.430 --> 00:43:48.440 align:start position:0%
right on there um and it's very
 
00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
interesting because it'll it breaks down
 
00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
um what they've been brought back in on
 
00:43:55.589 --> 00:43:55.599 align:start position:0%
probation hold uh new charges and so
 
00:43:59.109 --> 00:43:59.119 align:start position:0%
forth um hovered between 27 to 30%
 
00:44:00.910 --> 00:44:00.920 align:start position:0%
recidivism for those that were sentenced
 
00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:03.720 align:start position:0%
in our program so obvious the program is
 
00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:07.800 align:start position:0%
working and we've revamped it and um
 
00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
made it a little bit more robust now and
 
00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
it's we call it the ACT program
 
00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
so uh it's available to those
 
00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
individuals that are sentenced
 
00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:20.240 align:start position:0%
um oh right on the County website if you
 
00:44:24.589 --> 00:44:24.599 align:start position:0%
go on to um Hillsboro County um if you
 
00:44:27.069 --> 00:44:27.079 align:start position:0%
go under the Department of Correction s
 
00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
and it should be under the ACT program
 
00:44:34.430 --> 00:44:34.440 align:start position:0%
there's a slideshow talks about um uh um
 
00:44:36.309 --> 00:44:36.319 align:start position:0%
treatment programs inside the facility
 
00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:37.720 align:start position:0%
and you can see the data right on there
 
00:44:39.390 --> 00:44:39.400 align:start position:0%
and that was Lieutenant conin I who did
 
00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:41.800 align:start position:0%
that so um thank
 
00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
you several other counties we talked to
 
00:44:46.270 --> 00:44:46.280 align:start position:0%
seem to have some pretty successful
 
00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:48.400 align:start position:0%
pre-trial programs have you been in
 
00:44:49.630 --> 00:44:49.640 align:start position:0%
touch with them are you aware of what
 
00:44:51.349 --> 00:44:51.359 align:start position:0%
they're doing some of them seem to be
 
00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:53.200 align:start position:0%
actually realizing significant cost
 
00:44:56.870 --> 00:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
savings by utilizing that uh as as I
 
00:44:59.030 --> 00:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
stated earlier I came from a county that
 
00:45:01.069 --> 00:45:01.079 align:start position:0%
was that was utilizing a pre-trial
 
00:45:05.790 --> 00:45:05.800 align:start position:0%
service program um it it definitely has
 
00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
come it's definitely continued to to
 
00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
evolve um and I I mean I have seen I
 
00:45:14.109 --> 00:45:14.119 align:start position:0%
have seen it I will say that I have seen
 
00:45:17.589 --> 00:45:17.599 align:start position:0%
it um again I would just it would be the
 
00:45:18.829 --> 00:45:18.839 align:start position:0%
the will of the commissioner and their
 
00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
funding Authority about the because it
 
00:45:23.349 --> 00:45:23.359 align:start position:0%
will cost us um some more money
 
00:45:25.349 --> 00:45:25.359 align:start position:0%
obviously there's cost associated with
 
00:45:28.109 --> 00:45:28.119 align:start position:0%
operating full-time pre-trial
 
00:45:30.549 --> 00:45:30.559 align:start position:0%
programs having probably the most um
 
00:45:33.549 --> 00:45:33.559 align:start position:0%
turnover in the in the state as far as
 
00:45:34.990 --> 00:45:35.000 align:start position:0%
people comeing in and out we have the
 
00:45:37.230 --> 00:45:37.240 align:start position:0%
largest facility um we probably process
 
00:45:39.230 --> 00:45:39.240 align:start position:0%
the most people in and out um in that
 
00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
facility uh on a daily basis than any
 
00:45:46.150 --> 00:45:46.160 align:start position:0%
other facility in the state so we do if
 
00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
the um if the state made a a fund
 
00:45:53.230 --> 00:45:53.240 align:start position:0%
available that had certain requirements
 
00:45:55.069 --> 00:45:55.079 align:start position:0%
that a county would have to meet to
 
00:45:57.349 --> 00:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
apply to that fund f with regard to a
 
00:45:59.030 --> 00:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
pre-art program do you think that would
 
00:46:00.829 --> 00:46:00.839 align:start position:0%
something that would be interesting to
 
00:46:04.870 --> 00:46:04.880 align:start position:0%
to Hillsboro County I I would be I would
 
00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
urge us to to approach the the Board of
 
00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and the delegation um
 
00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
about that obviously because it's a it's
 
00:46:15.549 --> 00:46:15.559 align:start position:0%
a cost associated with it so I mean from
 
00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
okay pretend they all said yeah which is
 
00:46:21.870 --> 00:46:21.880 align:start position:0%
something that that the uh the doc would
 
00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
find um I think I think you find um it's
 
00:46:28.829 --> 00:46:28.839 align:start position:0%
it would it would fall back on how how
 
00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
the program is going to operate I think
 
00:46:33.349 --> 00:46:33.359 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of there would be a lot of
 
00:46:35.950 --> 00:46:35.960 align:start position:0%
um research that would need to be done
 
00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:38.640 align:start position:0%
into it um because most programs operate
 
00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
differently I know maramax operates
 
00:46:43.230 --> 00:46:43.240 align:start position:0%
underneath um the human services
 
00:46:45.109 --> 00:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
department straford operates out of the
 
00:46:47.950 --> 00:46:47.960 align:start position:0%
jail Rockingham operates out of the jail
 
00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
I know marac used to operate out of the
 
00:46:52.349 --> 00:46:52.359 align:start position:0%
county attorney's office so um I think
 
00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
it would just be a collective approach
 
00:46:56.349 --> 00:46:56.359 align:start position:0%
within the county that
 
00:46:59.190 --> 00:46:59.200 align:start position:0%
that multiple agencies would have to and
 
00:47:01.549 --> 00:47:01.559 align:start position:0%
stakeholders would have to buy into and
 
00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
and figure out what process works the
 
00:47:06.670 --> 00:47:06.680 align:start position:0%
best for Hillsboro so uh yeah I was
 
00:47:09.589 --> 00:47:09.599 align:start position:0%
thinking more of of the state looking at
 
00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
doing that leg work and finding the best
 
00:47:14.069 --> 00:47:14.079 align:start position:0%
practices and saying okay look we've got
 
00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
X number of dollars if you implement a
 
00:47:19.150 --> 00:47:19.160 align:start position:0%
program that has these things you can be
 
00:47:20.950 --> 00:47:20.960 align:start position:0%
eligible to apply to that program for
 
00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
money to reimburse you for running it
 
00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:26.520 align:start position:0%
that would that be something I think
 
00:47:27.950 --> 00:47:27.960 align:start position:0%
we're I think everybody wants to save
 
00:47:29.829 --> 00:47:29.839 align:start position:0%
some money so and get some money from
 
00:47:32.430 --> 00:47:32.440 align:start position:0%
somewhere so yeah um I I think that
 
00:47:34.670 --> 00:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
again I just think it would be a a
 
00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
conversation that we need to occur with
 
00:47:38.349 --> 00:47:38.359 align:start position:0%
the funding Authority and the for
 
00:47:40.990 --> 00:47:41.000 align:start position:0%
Commissioners represent Stone thank you
 
00:47:43.309 --> 00:47:43.319 align:start position:0%
you happen to spark my interest on
 
00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
something given the circumstances where
 
00:47:47.589 --> 00:47:47.599 align:start position:0%
each County operates independently and
 
00:47:49.349 --> 00:47:49.359 align:start position:0%
sets their own programs and parameters
 
00:47:51.630 --> 00:47:51.640 align:start position:0%
and we've heard testimony last week
 
00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:54.040 align:start position:0%
where uh you think it was uh it was
 
00:47:56.549 --> 00:47:56.559 align:start position:0%
marac and straford
 
00:47:57.910 --> 00:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
and when it came to violating the
 
00:47:59.950 --> 00:47:59.960 align:start position:0%
pre-trial one would be a letter sent to
 
00:48:01.390 --> 00:48:01.400 align:start position:0%
the court and another one would be sent
 
00:48:03.309 --> 00:48:03.319 align:start position:0%
to the county attorney would be better
 
00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:06.160 align:start position:0%
served in your experience that maybe the
 
00:48:07.549 --> 00:48:07.559 align:start position:0%
probation parole department for the
 
00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
state would be expanded on to include
 
00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:11.720 align:start position:0%
making it a bigger umbrella to include
 
00:48:14.750 --> 00:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
pre-trial confinement monitoring whether
 
00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:16.480 align:start position:0%
than putting in people in
 
00:48:19.710 --> 00:48:19.720 align:start position:0%
jail I would my experience and I know
 
00:48:20.910 --> 00:48:20.920 align:start position:0%
this was a question that we had asked
 
00:48:24.069 --> 00:48:24.079 align:start position:0%
about probation and parole um I know
 
00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
from my experience working with prob in
 
00:48:28.069 --> 00:48:28.079 align:start position:0%
parole um and speaking with them
 
00:48:30.549 --> 00:48:30.559 align:start position:0%
obviously it falls under the state um
 
00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
that they are stretched really thin
 
00:48:35.790 --> 00:48:35.800 align:start position:0%
right now um I
 
00:48:38.069 --> 00:48:38.079 align:start position:0%
I I don't know if they would have the
 
00:48:41.150 --> 00:48:41.160 align:start position:0%
resources to do that um if they were to
 
00:48:44.230 --> 00:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
expand their resources then I would say
 
00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
that would probably be a Comm a
 
00:48:47.390 --> 00:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
conversation with commissioner Hanks and
 
00:48:52.030 --> 00:48:52.040 align:start position:0%
and um uh Field Services uh um
 
00:48:55.150 --> 00:48:55.160 align:start position:0%
agency so I mean it could go two ways I
 
00:48:57.710 --> 00:48:57.720 align:start position:0%
guess I would say it it would it's
 
00:48:58.950 --> 00:48:58.960 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a cost either the
 
00:49:01.150 --> 00:49:01.160 align:start position:0%
county or or the state at that point and
 
00:49:02.789 --> 00:49:02.799 align:start position:0%
they doing the same job function it's
 
00:49:04.630 --> 00:49:04.640 align:start position:0%
would be the same whether and you know
 
00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire doesn't have County
 
00:49:09.270 --> 00:49:09.280 align:start position:0%
Probation um if New Hampshire was to go
 
00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
down that road of County Probation
 
00:49:11.950 --> 00:49:11.960 align:start position:0%
obviously there would be funding
 
00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
associated with that as well too so and
 
00:49:16.150 --> 00:49:16.160 align:start position:0%
that would shift the cost from the state
 
00:49:17.789 --> 00:49:17.799 align:start position:0%
down onto the county and obviously there
 
00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
would need to be some cost shiftings and
 
00:49:22.670 --> 00:49:22.680 align:start position:0%
saving and to the county if that if they
 
00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
were to take that over so thank you it
 
00:49:28.670 --> 00:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
it just the observation that I I mean
 
00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to speak for the committee
 
00:49:32.190 --> 00:49:32.200 align:start position:0%
but I have seen during the hundreds of
 
00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
hours of hearings we've had
 
00:49:37.950 --> 00:49:37.960 align:start position:0%
um first of all I'm a state
 
00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
representative but I'm also a citizen of
 
00:49:42.549 --> 00:49:42.559 align:start position:0%
a county and it seems to me that the
 
00:49:46.030 --> 00:49:46.040 align:start position:0%
states is is creating laws that make
 
00:49:48.990 --> 00:49:49.000 align:start position:0%
crimes sentencing people for breaking
 
00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
those laws and telling the county to pay
 
00:49:54.109 --> 00:49:54.119 align:start position:0%
for it is that pretty much accurate I
 
00:49:56.670 --> 00:49:56.680 align:start position:0%
mean very Loosely speaking
 
00:49:58.710 --> 00:49:58.720 align:start position:0%
there is there is some cost shifting yes
 
00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
and the cost shift comes onto the county
 
00:50:02.430 --> 00:50:02.440 align:start position:0%
and it could be a citizen from another
 
00:50:04.950 --> 00:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
County who lives his whole life in the
 
00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:06.640 align:start position:0%
other County commits a crime in your
 
00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
county and now he's a citizen of yourk
 
00:50:10.549 --> 00:50:10.559 align:start position:0%
County until he's released I give you a
 
00:50:13.870 --> 00:50:13.880 align:start position:0%
very clear example parole violations
 
00:50:15.549 --> 00:50:15.559 align:start position:0%
individuals with parole violations that
 
00:50:17.630 --> 00:50:17.640 align:start position:0%
pick up new charges they are
 
00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the county but yet
 
00:50:22.190 --> 00:50:22.200 align:start position:0%
they are on parole violations they are
 
00:50:23.870 --> 00:50:23.880 align:start position:0%
not they are not picked up until those
 
00:50:26.309 --> 00:50:26.319 align:start position:0%
County charges have been resolved
 
00:50:29.710 --> 00:50:29.720 align:start position:0%
so that individual who is under parole
 
00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
supervision just and they I understand
 
00:50:34.390 --> 00:50:34.400 align:start position:0%
they picked up new charges but they're
 
00:50:36.829 --> 00:50:36.839 align:start position:0%
still under a house of cor I mean a
 
00:50:39.270 --> 00:50:39.280 align:start position:0%
state prison sentence and supervision
 
00:50:40.710 --> 00:50:40.720 align:start position:0%
and they and that gets transferred down
 
00:50:42.870 --> 00:50:42.880 align:start position:0%
to the county and we sit on them until
 
00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
all those charges are resolved so if
 
00:50:46.309 --> 00:50:46.319 align:start position:0%
they were not on parole they would have
 
00:50:47.950 --> 00:50:47.960 align:start position:0%
been eligible for just bail and it would
 
00:50:49.670 --> 00:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
have been routine proc they'd still be
 
00:50:51.829 --> 00:50:51.839 align:start position:0%
eligible for bail they're still eligible
 
00:50:53.230 --> 00:50:53.240 align:start position:0%
for bail on their new charges if they
 
00:50:54.910 --> 00:50:54.920 align:start position:0%
get bailed on their new charges they we
 
00:50:56.510 --> 00:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
were transfer for them to the state
 
00:50:58.750 --> 00:50:58.760 align:start position:0%
prison if they're not bailed on their
 
00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
new charges then they sit with us even
 
00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
though they were a
 
00:51:04.750 --> 00:51:04.760 align:start position:0%
parole representative
 
00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
Stone I can't imagine a lot of people
 
00:51:10.870 --> 00:51:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:13.950 --> 00:51:13.960 align:start position:0%
prison have you had people decline to to
 
00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:15.030 align:start position:0%
prison have you had people decline to to
take

00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
take
 
00:51:18.030 --> 00:51:18.040 align:start position:0%
bail I'm uh I've seen people decline
 
00:51:21.069 --> 00:51:21.079 align:start position:0%
bail over my years yes thank you any
 
00:51:23.470 --> 00:51:23.480 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
00:51:24.829 --> 00:51:24.839 align:start position:0%

time and um at this time we have
 
00:51:43.309 --> 00:51:43.319 align:start position:0%

00:52:09.069 --> 00:52:09.079 align:start position:0%
this morning my name is Sarah Rothman I
 
00:52:10.789 --> 00:52:10.799 align:start position:0%
am the executive director of the New
 
00:52:12.990 --> 00:52:13.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire public defender um I've been
 
00:52:15.589 --> 00:52:15.599 align:start position:0%
with the public defender for 16 years um
 
00:52:18.150 --> 00:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
and I've been in my role um for about a
 
00:52:20.589 --> 00:52:20.599 align:start position:0%
year a little bit over a year um I think
 
00:52:22.990 --> 00:52:23.000 align:start position:0%
I had the opportunity to speak with you
 
00:52:25.349 --> 00:52:25.359 align:start position:0%
some months ago um at the beginning of
 
00:52:26.910 --> 00:52:26.920 align:start position:0%
the session um just to kind of give you
 
00:52:28.589 --> 00:52:28.599 align:start position:0%
an overview of what the public defender
 
00:52:30.510 --> 00:52:30.520 align:start position:0%
does but just very briefly I can tell
 
00:52:33.270 --> 00:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
you um you know we are sort of the One
 
00:52:35.789 --> 00:52:35.799 align:start position:0%
Stop Shop for um you know Public Defense
 
00:52:37.990 --> 00:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
or for um criminal defense in New
 
00:52:40.630 --> 00:52:40.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh we represent roughly about
 
00:52:43.069 --> 00:52:43.079 align:start position:0%
85% of all criminal defendants in the
 
00:52:46.270 --> 00:52:46.280 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire um there is We
 
00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
Exist by Statute um there's a statute in
 
00:52:50.670 --> 00:52:50.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that says that um the
 
00:52:53.430 --> 00:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
state shall contract with a law firm um
 
00:52:57.430 --> 00:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
to provide uh defense to Indigent um
 
00:53:00.230 --> 00:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
defendants um and we are uh we we bid
 
00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
for a contract every two years we are a
 
00:53:04.549 --> 00:53:04.559 align:start position:0%
private nonprofit Law Firm um we bid for
 
00:53:06.390 --> 00:53:06.400 align:start position:0%
a contract every two years with the
 
00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:07.470 align:start position:0%
a contract every two years with the
judicial

00:53:07.470 --> 00:53:07.480 align:start position:0%
judicial
 
00:53:11.069 --> 00:53:11.079 align:start position:0%
Council um and then obviously we're also
 
00:53:13.150 --> 00:53:13.160 align:start position:0%
you know aside from statutorily required
 
00:53:14.950 --> 00:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
also constitutionally under the federal
 
00:53:18.030 --> 00:53:18.040 align:start position:0%
and the state constitution um required U
 
00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
for anybody facing potential jail time
 
00:53:21.829 --> 00:53:21.839 align:start position:0%
to be afforded uh an attorney if they
 
00:53:23.870 --> 00:53:23.880 align:start position:0%
can't afford one and if they qualify
 
00:53:27.589 --> 00:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
after applying with the court um so I
 
00:53:29.230 --> 00:53:29.240 align:start position:0%
again thank you for the opportunity to
 
00:53:32.670 --> 00:53:32.680 align:start position:0%
allow me to address um from from my
 
00:53:34.190 --> 00:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
perspective from the public defender
 
00:53:35.789 --> 00:53:35.799 align:start position:0%
perspective um you know some of the
 
00:53:38.670 --> 00:53:38.680 align:start position:0%
issues with the the current legislation
 
00:53:40.589 --> 00:53:40.599 align:start position:0%
that's pending with regarding uh with
 
00:53:43.710 --> 00:53:43.720 align:start position:0%
regards to bail um I do want to say uh
 
00:53:45.390 --> 00:53:45.400 align:start position:0%
you know at the outset I I kind of want
 
00:53:49.589 --> 00:53:49.599 align:start position:0%
to Echo um a lot of what
 
00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:52.720 align:start position:0%
um the previous testimony um which is
 
00:53:55.589 --> 00:53:55.599 align:start position:0%
that the the changes the proposed those
 
00:53:59.789 --> 00:53:59.799 align:start position:0%
changes um to the bail statute um simply
 
00:54:02.710 --> 00:54:02.720 align:start position:0%
cannot be sustained um financially or
 
00:54:05.710 --> 00:54:05.720 align:start position:0%
logistically um by the public defender
 
00:54:07.789 --> 00:54:07.799 align:start position:0%
by the prosecutor's offices across the
 
00:54:10.870 --> 00:54:10.880 align:start position:0%
state and by the courts um I I I hope
 
00:54:13.430 --> 00:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
that I can impress uh upon everybody
 
00:54:15.390 --> 00:54:15.400 align:start position:0%
that the significant change that this
 
00:54:17.829 --> 00:54:17.839 align:start position:0%
will represent the significant volume
 
00:54:20.910 --> 00:54:20.920 align:start position:0%
increase that this will represent um and
 
00:54:23.190 --> 00:54:23.200 align:start position:0%
I also want to try and impress that it
 
00:54:25.390 --> 00:54:25.400 align:start position:0%
would be a change without um without
 
00:54:28.630 --> 00:54:28.640 align:start position:0%
need um because of several factors that
 
00:54:31.510 --> 00:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
I'd like to get into this morning um so
 
00:54:34.510 --> 00:54:34.520 align:start position:0%
I I think it will cause you know a an
 
00:54:36.910 --> 00:54:36.920 align:start position:0%
explosion of the number of bail hearings
 
00:54:41.069 --> 00:54:41.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:44.710 --> 00:54:44.720 align:start position:0%
cover sure so the list of you know there
 
00:54:46.430 --> 00:54:46.440 align:start position:0%
different bills have different lists but
 
00:54:49.750 --> 00:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
adding 12 to 13 offenses um that you are
 
00:54:51.349 --> 00:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
just prohibited from seeing a bail
 
00:54:54.069 --> 00:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
commissioner for um and must be held um
 
00:54:56.230 --> 00:54:56.240 align:start position:0%
until you can go in front of of a judge
 
00:54:57.990 --> 00:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
um so those are people who right now and
 
00:54:59.870 --> 00:54:59.880 align:start position:0%
I understand that there are you heard
 
00:55:01.549 --> 00:55:01.559 align:start position:0%
and you've heard over the weeks um
 
00:55:03.470 --> 00:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
testimony about the lack of bail
 
00:55:06.309 --> 00:55:06.319 align:start position:0%
Commissioners um and um certainly I
 
00:55:07.950 --> 00:55:07.960 align:start position:0%
think that there's a lot of solutions we
 
00:55:10.390 --> 00:55:10.400 align:start position:0%
could bring to that particular problem
 
00:55:12.549 --> 00:55:12.559 align:start position:0%
um that do not involve um just cutting
 
00:55:14.270 --> 00:55:14.280 align:start position:0%
out Bail Commissioners um bail
 
00:55:16.430 --> 00:55:16.440 align:start position:0%
Commissioners even though um it's a
 
00:55:19.510 --> 00:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
resource that is limited um provides a
 
00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:21.880 align:start position:0%
really important function in the system
 
00:55:24.750 --> 00:55:24.760 align:start position:0%
um which is to evaluate whether people
 
00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
actually need to be held um to see a
 
00:55:31.069 --> 00:55:31.079 align:start position:0%
judge and if we create you know 12 or 13
 
00:55:33.549 --> 00:55:33.559 align:start position:0%
statute statutes that they are just not
 
00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
allowed to see a bail commissioner um we
 
00:55:38.230 --> 00:55:38.240 align:start position:0%
are going to see a huge explosion in the
 
00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
number um of incarcerated bail hearings
 
00:55:43.109 --> 00:55:43.119 align:start position:0%
that my office will then have to cover
 
00:55:45.190 --> 00:55:45.200 align:start position:0%
on a daily basis that prosecutors and
 
00:55:47.870 --> 00:55:47.880 align:start position:0%
judges and Court staff um will have to
 
00:55:50.390 --> 00:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
cope with um you know and the reason
 
00:55:52.029 --> 00:55:52.039 align:start position:0%
that these people when they see a bail
 
00:55:54.750 --> 00:55:54.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner are currently released um
 
00:55:57.510 --> 00:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
is because um you know they are a good
 
00:55:59.549 --> 00:55:59.559 align:start position:0%
candidate for bail um so these are
 
00:56:01.829 --> 00:56:01.839 align:start position:0%
people this volume of people that we're
 
00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
currently not seeing we're not seeing
 
00:56:05.870 --> 00:56:05.880 align:start position:0%
them because we don't need to see them
 
00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
um and I want to get into that a little
 
00:56:11.150 --> 00:56:11.160 align:start position:0%
bit further um but just to kind of start
 
00:56:13.109 --> 00:56:13.119 align:start position:0%
at the outset to talk about the impact
 
00:56:15.670 --> 00:56:15.680 align:start position:0%
that this would have um you know
 
00:56:18.150 --> 00:56:18.160 align:start position:0%
financially and I guess I can't speak in
 
00:56:20.349 --> 00:56:20.359 align:start position:0%
too concrete of terms financially except
 
00:56:23.109 --> 00:56:23.119 align:start position:0%
to say that um this will require us to
 
00:56:25.349 --> 00:56:25.359 align:start position:0%
have more staff and require um a lot
 
00:56:28.190 --> 00:56:28.200 align:start position:0%
more attorney time from us um you know
 
00:56:29.549 --> 00:56:29.559 align:start position:0%
right now whether I'm prepared to kind
 
00:56:31.510 --> 00:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
of quantify that in a dollar amount not
 
00:56:35.029 --> 00:56:35.039 align:start position:0%
necessarily but I can say more um is is
 
00:56:37.349 --> 00:56:37.359 align:start position:0%
a good way to say that um I I guess I
 
00:56:39.470 --> 00:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
would also encourage um Everybody if you
 
00:56:41.309 --> 00:56:41.319 align:start position:0%
haven't already to look at the fiscal
 
00:56:44.510 --> 00:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
note um that's there for Senate Bill 252
 
00:56:47.390 --> 00:56:47.400 align:start position:0%
that's also pending um that one that
 
00:56:50.190 --> 00:56:50.200 align:start position:0%
bill has a fiscal note um from the
 
00:56:52.349 --> 00:56:52.359 align:start position:0%
judicial branch about the impact of
 
00:56:54.750 --> 00:56:54.760 align:start position:0%
adding all of these statutes to a list
 
00:56:57.270 --> 00:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
um of folks who will not be able to see
 
00:56:58.270 --> 00:56:58.280 align:start position:0%
a bail
 
00:57:01.589 --> 00:57:01.599 align:start position:0%
commissioner um so you know if they're
 
00:57:03.589 --> 00:57:03.599 align:start position:0%
not able to see a bail commissioner uh
 
00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
that means that they need to have um a
 
00:57:08.789 --> 00:57:08.799 align:start position:0%
lawyer appointed to them um obviously
 
00:57:10.150 --> 00:57:10.160 align:start position:0%
these folks would have a lawyer
 
00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
appointed to them at some point anyway
 
00:57:14.430 --> 00:57:14.440 align:start position:0%
um but these are you know what we often
 
00:57:17.150 --> 00:57:17.160 align:start position:0%
refer to as same day or next day
 
00:57:19.390 --> 00:57:19.400 align:start position:0%
hearings um so these are our our
 
00:57:21.549 --> 00:57:21.559 align:start position:0%
defendants that we find out about at in
 
00:57:23.910 --> 00:57:23.920 align:start position:0%
the best case scenario late afternoon
 
00:57:25.549 --> 00:57:25.559 align:start position:0%
the day before but in almost all
 
00:57:28.630 --> 00:57:28.640 align:start position:0%
instances the day of the hearing so um
 
00:57:30.150 --> 00:57:30.160 align:start position:0%
you know sometime in the morning we get
 
00:57:32.430 --> 00:57:32.440 align:start position:0%
a list and then slowly paperwork starts
 
00:57:34.630 --> 00:57:34.640 align:start position:0%
to trickle in um you know the the
 
00:57:36.390 --> 00:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
charges against the person and an arrest
 
00:57:38.589 --> 00:57:38.599 align:start position:0%
warrant affidavit um and then there's a
 
00:57:40.069 --> 00:57:40.079 align:start position:0%
whole process that we have to go through
 
00:57:42.430 --> 00:57:42.440 align:start position:0%
on our end to conflict check and to get
 
00:57:45.349 --> 00:57:45.359 align:start position:0%
a lawyer present um to represent that
 
00:57:47.069 --> 00:57:47.079 align:start position:0%
person and then as you've heard uh
 
00:57:49.230 --> 00:57:49.240 align:start position:0%
briefly earlier this morning there's
 
00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:50.960 align:start position:0%
logistical issues and being able to talk
 
00:57:54.150 --> 00:57:54.160 align:start position:0%
to that person um prior to their hearing
 
00:57:55.309 --> 00:57:55.319 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:57:57.270 --> 00:57:57.280 align:start position:0%
you know sometimes you know we work
 
00:57:59.309 --> 00:57:59.319 align:start position:0%
County by count to create systems to try
 
00:58:02.470 --> 00:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
and be able to do that um but um you
 
00:58:04.430 --> 00:58:04.440 align:start position:0%
know those systems are not perfect um
 
00:58:05.950 --> 00:58:05.960 align:start position:0%
and it can be very difficult to access
 
00:58:08.549 --> 00:58:08.559 align:start position:0%
our clients before these hearings um and
 
00:58:10.789 --> 00:58:10.799 align:start position:0%
particularly you know there there's in
 
00:58:12.829 --> 00:58:12.839 align:start position:0%
in an ideal world there's back and forth
 
00:58:14.309 --> 00:58:14.319 align:start position:0%
right you talk with your client you find
 
00:58:16.230 --> 00:58:16.240 align:start position:0%
out some information and then you talk
 
00:58:18.309 --> 00:58:18.319 align:start position:0%
with the prosecutor um because it is
 
00:58:20.029 --> 00:58:20.039 align:start position:0%
possible to negotiate bail or to
 
00:58:22.630 --> 00:58:22.640 align:start position:0%
negotiate conditions of bail um so then
 
00:58:24.750 --> 00:58:24.760 align:start position:0%
you talk with the prosecutor and then
 
00:58:25.910 --> 00:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
you know you want to talk to your client
 
00:58:27.910 --> 00:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
again and you're lucky enough a lot of
 
00:58:29.510 --> 00:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
times to have one conversation with your
 
00:58:31.309 --> 00:58:31.319 align:start position:0%
client before this hearing and let alone
 
00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
another one um so there's this whole
 
00:58:35.589 --> 00:58:35.599 align:start position:0%
process that has to take place that we
 
00:58:38.270 --> 00:58:38.280 align:start position:0%
already do um but now we are talking
 
00:58:40.589 --> 00:58:40.599 align:start position:0%
about expanding that um to a whole
 
00:58:43.470 --> 00:58:43.480 align:start position:0%
population of people who otherwise um
 
00:58:44.750 --> 00:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
could have had access to a bail
 
00:58:46.589 --> 00:58:46.599 align:start position:0%
commissioner and potentially not be held
 
00:58:48.990 --> 00:58:49.000 align:start position:0%
and not need that same day hearing um
 
00:58:51.750 --> 00:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
which will take um time and resources
 
00:58:53.670 --> 00:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
from the public defender from
 
00:58:57.950 --> 00:58:57.960 align:start position:0%
prosecutors um and from Court staff um
 
00:59:00.150 --> 00:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
we are and I you know I don't want to
 
00:59:01.750 --> 00:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
Sidetrack us too much on this but the
 
00:59:04.150 --> 00:59:04.160 align:start position:0%
public defender um continues to struggle
 
00:59:06.270 --> 00:59:06.280 align:start position:0%
with our staffing levels um we continue
 
00:59:10.349 --> 00:59:10.359 align:start position:0%
to face very very steep attrition um we
 
00:59:12.630 --> 00:59:12.640 align:start position:0%
um have
 
00:59:16.750 --> 00:59:16.760 align:start position:0%
lost since July 1 um as of tomorrow will
 
00:59:19.109 --> 00:59:19.119 align:start position:0%
we we will be down nine attorneys um
 
00:59:22.390 --> 00:59:22.400 align:start position:0%
since July 1 um as of November 1st we we
 
00:59:24.829 --> 00:59:24.839 align:start position:0%
will be down 10 attorneys and as of
 
00:59:28.309 --> 00:59:28.319 align:start position:0%
January we will be down 12 attorneys um
 
00:59:32.789 --> 00:59:32.799 align:start position:0%
and so um people uh and at fiscal year
 
00:59:35.230 --> 00:59:35.240 align:start position:0%
the last fiscal year 23 we lost 22
 
00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
attorneys um so by January we will
 
00:59:41.910 --> 00:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
already be at 12 um and Counting so um
 
00:59:44.710 --> 00:59:44.720 align:start position:0%
it is already um you know difficult for
 
00:59:46.430 --> 00:59:46.440 align:start position:0%
us to staff the workload that we
 
00:59:49.710 --> 00:59:49.720 align:start position:0%
currently have um you know I think that
 
00:59:52.230 --> 00:59:52.240 align:start position:0%
um some committee members might be aware
 
00:59:54.270 --> 00:59:54.280 align:start position:0%
that um during the pandemic we had to
 
00:59:56.750 --> 00:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
put certain categories of cases on hold
 
00:59:58.990 --> 00:59:59.000 align:start position:0%
to wait assignment of council we have
 
01:00:01.510 --> 01:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
largely cleared that list um and are now
 
01:00:03.510 --> 01:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
back to assigning cases upon receipt
 
01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:06.720 align:start position:0%
from the court um but case Lo case loads
 
01:00:09.549 --> 01:00:09.559 align:start position:0%
among our staff are are consistently
 
01:00:12.270 --> 01:00:12.280 align:start position:0%
high again um and it's then it feeds
 
01:00:14.309 --> 01:00:14.319 align:start position:0%
this cycle of attrition you know the the
 
01:00:17.230 --> 01:00:17.240 align:start position:0%
workload is too much and too stressful
 
01:00:19.150 --> 01:00:19.160 align:start position:0%
um and the pay is not enough and so
 
01:00:22.589 --> 01:00:22.599 align:start position:0%
people leave um and it might seem kind
 
01:00:25.349 --> 01:00:25.359 align:start position:0%
of abstract to tie change to the bail
 
01:00:27.630 --> 01:00:27.640 align:start position:0%
law to increase attrition at the at the
 
01:00:30.510 --> 01:00:30.520 align:start position:0%
public defender but it's not abstract um
 
01:00:33.309 --> 01:00:33.319 align:start position:0%
you know if we add in additional you
 
01:00:36.309 --> 01:00:36.319 align:start position:0%
know bail hearings on a daily basis um
 
01:00:37.710 --> 01:00:37.720 align:start position:0%
you know we're already going to be doing
 
01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
bail hearings um but you know a even to
 
01:00:43.510 --> 01:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
get sometimes a bail agre an agreement
 
01:00:46.670 --> 01:00:46.680 align:start position:0%
on bail um for one client can take two
 
01:00:48.829 --> 01:00:48.839 align:start position:0%
to three hours and so now if you're
 
01:00:51.390 --> 01:00:51.400 align:start position:0%
trying to do that on behalf of four and
 
01:00:53.069 --> 01:00:53.079 align:start position:0%
five clients because there's people who
 
01:00:54.950 --> 01:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
did not have access or not allowed to
 
01:00:57.430 --> 01:00:57.440 align:start position:0%
see a bail commissioner um you know then
 
01:01:00.230 --> 01:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
we're talking about half of or more than
 
01:01:03.510 --> 01:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
half of your day um working on just bail
 
01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
hearings um when you have a lot of other
 
01:01:07.349 --> 01:01:07.359 align:start position:0%
kinds of hearings you have to go to the
 
01:01:09.069 --> 01:01:09.079 align:start position:0%
jail to meet with other clients you have
 
01:01:10.670 --> 01:01:10.680 align:start position:0%
motions you need to write you know all
 
01:01:12.109 --> 01:01:12.119 align:start position:0%
of the other things that we need to do
 
01:01:16.069 --> 01:01:16.079 align:start position:0%
during our day um and so I just I I want
 
01:01:18.750 --> 01:01:18.760 align:start position:0%
to emphasize that you know the system is
 
01:01:21.109 --> 01:01:21.119 align:start position:0%
is has had you know reached a Breaking
 
01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
Point a couple of years ago um and kind
 
01:01:25.750 --> 01:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
of buckled and we've kind of tried to
 
01:01:29.230 --> 01:01:29.240 align:start position:0%
claw our way back um but as um you know
 
01:01:30.870 --> 01:01:30.880 align:start position:0%
you heard in the previous testimony as
 
01:01:33.510 --> 01:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
of January 1 there's already going to be
 
01:01:36.870 --> 01:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
significant change to the system um that
 
01:01:38.910 --> 01:01:38.920 align:start position:0%
I think will cause uh arraignments and
 
01:01:40.950 --> 01:01:40.960 align:start position:0%
bail hearings to to be more time
 
01:01:44.430 --> 01:01:44.440 align:start position:0%
consuming as it is um for our office uh
 
01:01:47.069 --> 01:01:47.079 align:start position:0%
and with these changes um if these
 
01:01:48.829 --> 01:01:48.839 align:start position:0%
proposed changes with creating a you
 
01:01:52.349 --> 01:01:52.359 align:start position:0%
know a list of 12 or 13 offenses um that
 
01:01:54.549 --> 01:01:54.559 align:start position:0%
are automatic holds um people are not
 
01:01:57.829 --> 01:01:57.839 align:start position:0%
entitled uh to bail until seeing a judge
 
01:02:00.109 --> 01:02:00.119 align:start position:0%
um you know I it going to be difficult
 
01:02:03.069 --> 01:02:03.079 align:start position:0%
to impossible to staff and sustain that
 
01:02:03.079 --> 01:02:06.109 align:start position:0%
to impossible to staff and sustain that
work

01:02:06.109 --> 01:02:06.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:09.470 --> 01:02:09.480 align:start position:0%
um felony's first change Y how is that
 
01:02:11.589 --> 01:02:11.599 align:start position:0%
going to impact your office um if you
 
01:02:14.029 --> 01:02:14.039 align:start position:0%
could it's my understanding that in the
 
01:02:16.109 --> 01:02:16.119 align:start position:0%
first instance felonies were being heard
 
01:02:18.190 --> 01:02:18.200 align:start position:0%
in Superior Court now they're all
 
01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
shifting back to the Circuit Court would
 
01:02:22.150 --> 01:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
you not have to appear at either one of
 
01:02:24.510 --> 01:02:24.520 align:start position:0%
those or what's the difference that
 
01:02:26.750 --> 01:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
right yeah that's a great question so
 
01:02:29.190 --> 01:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
you know right now we staff um the
 
01:02:31.029 --> 01:02:31.039 align:start position:0%
felony arraignments in 10 Superior
 
01:02:33.549 --> 01:02:33.559 align:start position:0%
Courts in the state um and so now we are
 
01:02:36.069 --> 01:02:36.079 align:start position:0%
going from Staffing 10 courts to
 
01:02:41.470 --> 01:02:41.480 align:start position:0%
Staffing 31 circuit courts um and we um
 
01:02:44.190 --> 01:02:44.200 align:start position:0%
most of the counties now will transport
 
01:02:47.269 --> 01:02:47.279 align:start position:0%
defendants to the courthouse um and so
 
01:02:49.710 --> 01:02:49.720 align:start position:0%
we don't have to do this giant struggle
 
01:02:50.990 --> 01:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
of trying to get in touch with our
 
01:02:52.910 --> 01:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
clients at the jail either by you know
 
01:02:55.670 --> 01:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
by phone um you know going to the jail
 
01:02:57.789 --> 01:02:57.799 align:start position:0%
is sometimes an option but often not an
 
01:03:00.190 --> 01:03:00.200 align:start position:0%
option because if you're at the jail you
 
01:03:02.029 --> 01:03:02.039 align:start position:0%
don't have access to talk to anybody
 
01:03:03.829 --> 01:03:03.839 align:start position:0%
else um so you can't talk to the
 
01:03:06.109 --> 01:03:06.119 align:start position:0%
prosecutor you can't um or it could be
 
01:03:08.029 --> 01:03:08.039 align:start position:0%
very difficult in a lot of cases it's
 
01:03:10.309 --> 01:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
impossible um there might be one or two
 
01:03:12.109 --> 01:03:12.119 align:start position:0%
houses of Corrections that allow you to
 
01:03:13.470 --> 01:03:13.480 align:start position:0%
you know write emails or something from
 
01:03:15.950 --> 01:03:15.960 align:start position:0%
the jail but um so anyway being at the
 
01:03:18.309 --> 01:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
jail is is usually not much of an option
 
01:03:20.349 --> 01:03:20.359 align:start position:0%
and so currently we're able to send
 
01:03:23.029 --> 01:03:23.039 align:start position:0%
attorneys to the courthouse um to staff
 
01:03:26.710 --> 01:03:26.720 align:start position:0%
those arraignments um come January 1
 
01:03:28.150 --> 01:03:28.160 align:start position:0%
again it's going to be spread out over
 
01:03:31.670 --> 01:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
31 courts um they defendants are by and
 
01:03:33.309 --> 01:03:33.319 align:start position:0%
large we've been told not going to be
 
01:03:35.109 --> 01:03:35.119 align:start position:0%
transported um they're going to appear
 
01:03:37.630 --> 01:03:37.640 align:start position:0%
by video um and so we're going to have
 
01:03:40.630 --> 01:03:40.640 align:start position:0%
to do this um this struggle every
 
01:03:42.750 --> 01:03:42.760 align:start position:0%
morning to try to talk to these clients
 
01:03:43.789 --> 01:03:43.799 align:start position:0%
you know we have to wait to get
 
01:03:45.549 --> 01:03:45.559 align:start position:0%
paperwork to to have something to talk
 
01:03:48.150 --> 01:03:48.160 align:start position:0%
to them about um and so then a lot of
 
01:03:50.430 --> 01:03:50.440 align:start position:0%
times the window between when we have
 
01:03:52.430 --> 01:03:52.440 align:start position:0%
their charges and when the heing is
 
01:03:54.950 --> 01:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
supposed to start is very small um and
 
01:03:56.510 --> 01:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
you might have telephone access but
 
01:03:58.349 --> 01:03:58.359 align:start position:0%
there might be one phone line and you're
 
01:03:59.589 --> 01:03:59.599 align:start position:0%
you know you're fighting against
 
01:04:00.910 --> 01:04:00.920 align:start position:0%
everybody else who wants to use that
 
01:04:04.230 --> 01:04:04.240 align:start position:0%
phone line um so um it's a huge
 
01:04:06.950 --> 01:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
logistical issue for us um the shift
 
01:04:09.470 --> 01:04:09.480 align:start position:0%
back um to Circuit Court I mean in other
 
01:04:11.069 --> 01:04:11.079 align:start position:0%
ways that are not really relevant here
 
01:04:12.789 --> 01:04:12.799 align:start position:0%
today we're excited that you know these
 
01:04:14.670 --> 01:04:14.680 align:start position:0%
are shifting back to Circuit Court we
 
01:04:16.990 --> 01:04:17.000 align:start position:0%
hope that that will lead to you know
 
01:04:18.990 --> 01:04:19.000 align:start position:0%
quicker resolution of cases and I think
 
01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
that was a big point of of bringing them
 
01:04:23.029 --> 01:04:23.039 align:start position:0%
back to the Circuit Court um to try to
 
01:04:25.309 --> 01:04:25.319 align:start position:0%
shorten the timeline life of these cases
 
01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:27.640 align:start position:0%
to try and resolve them um a lot of
 
01:04:29.150 --> 01:04:29.160 align:start position:0%
felonies get
 
01:04:31.510 --> 01:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
resolved excuse me as misdemeanors in
 
01:04:33.390 --> 01:04:33.400 align:start position:0%
Superior Court anyway so why don't we do
 
01:04:35.670 --> 01:04:35.680 align:start position:0%
that sooner in the process um so there's
 
01:04:37.069 --> 01:04:37.079 align:start position:0%
a lot of advantages of it I don't want
 
01:04:38.670 --> 01:04:38.680 align:start position:0%
to make it sound like I'm I'm against
 
01:04:40.630 --> 01:04:40.640 align:start position:0%
you know the return to Circuit Court but
 
01:04:42.269 --> 01:04:42.279 align:start position:0%
it does present a lot of logistical
 
01:04:43.670 --> 01:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
challenges for us that it's just going
 
01:04:45.510 --> 01:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
to take time it's going to take attorney
 
01:04:47.069 --> 01:04:47.079 align:start position:0%
time it's going to take support staff
 
01:04:50.510 --> 01:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
time um so um you know that's a big
 
01:04:52.549 --> 01:04:52.559 align:start position:0%
change that we are preparing for come
 
01:04:56.269 --> 01:04:56.279 align:start position:0%
January 1 anyway um um and um you know
 
01:04:59.630 --> 01:04:59.640 align:start position:0%
we are hoping um right now the public
 
01:05:02.150 --> 01:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
defender uh unfortunately Statewide is
 
01:05:04.069 --> 01:05:04.079 align:start position:0%
not staff incarcerated misdemeanor
 
01:05:06.069 --> 01:05:06.079 align:start position:0%
arraignments Statewide we do it in some
 
01:05:08.430 --> 01:05:08.440 align:start position:0%
parts of the state where we can um but
 
01:05:10.349 --> 01:05:10.359 align:start position:0%
in other parts of the state you know one
 
01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
office covers six different circuit
 
01:05:14.910 --> 01:05:14.920 align:start position:0%
courts and they can't they simply just
 
01:05:17.630 --> 01:05:17.640 align:start position:0%
cannot send attorneys um to six
 
01:05:19.510 --> 01:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
different circuit courts to cover these
 
01:05:22.589 --> 01:05:22.599 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor incarcerated arraignments um
 
01:05:25.430 --> 01:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
now we are hoping um that there all
 
01:05:26.910 --> 01:05:26.920 align:start position:0%
arraignments incarcerated arraignments
 
01:05:28.510 --> 01:05:28.520 align:start position:0%
are going to be out of the Circuit Court
 
01:05:31.109 --> 01:05:31.119 align:start position:0%
they're all going to be by video um we
 
01:05:32.710 --> 01:05:32.720 align:start position:0%
are hoping to be able to staff
 
01:05:34.990 --> 01:05:35.000 align:start position:0%
incarcerated misun arraignments more
 
01:05:37.990 --> 01:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
than we currently are um and so that
 
01:05:39.829 --> 01:05:39.839 align:start position:0%
will be an increase in our in our
 
01:05:42.230 --> 01:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
workload and then if we add again this
 
01:05:44.349 --> 01:05:44.359 align:start position:0%
list of offenses um then that's another
 
01:05:48.670 --> 01:05:48.680 align:start position:0%
increase as well um so um you know I I
 
01:05:50.430 --> 01:05:50.440 align:start position:0%
think that well you could say well you
 
01:05:52.230 --> 01:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
know not that you are offering this but
 
01:05:53.309 --> 01:05:53.319 align:start position:0%
you know once it we'll give you more
 
01:05:57.029 --> 01:05:57.039 align:start position:0%
money um okay you know that sure um but
 
01:05:59.549 --> 01:05:59.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't make staff appear um you know
 
01:06:03.069 --> 01:06:03.079 align:start position:0%
certainly I I I think that um you know
 
01:06:04.710 --> 01:06:04.720 align:start position:0%
we've done some adjustments to our pay
 
01:06:06.349 --> 01:06:06.359 align:start position:0%
if we could do more you know that could
 
01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
potentially help with retention um but
 
01:06:11.069 --> 01:06:11.079 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day um it just it we
 
01:06:13.430 --> 01:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
need bodies we need the people um and so
 
01:06:17.589 --> 01:06:17.599 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily just about money um
 
01:06:19.990 --> 01:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
so I guess kind of Shifting to because I
 
01:06:21.789 --> 01:06:21.799 align:start position:0%
I understand one of the reactions to
 
01:06:24.390 --> 01:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
this might be to say I hear what you're
 
01:06:25.990 --> 01:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
saying you know we get it this is going
 
01:06:27.510 --> 01:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
to be you know but this is what we have
 
01:06:29.990 --> 01:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
to do for Public Safety this list of 12
 
01:06:32.269 --> 01:06:32.279 align:start position:0%
to 13 offenses these offenses are so
 
01:06:34.670 --> 01:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
serious um that sometimes you just have
 
01:06:37.510 --> 01:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
to make the law and then make it work um
 
01:06:38.910 --> 01:06:38.920 align:start position:0%
and so I definitely want to speak to
 
01:06:40.510 --> 01:06:40.520 align:start position:0%
that point because I I don't believe
 
01:06:43.430 --> 01:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
that to be true um you know the the list
 
01:06:47.309 --> 01:06:47.319 align:start position:0%
of offenses certainly I am not trying to
 
01:06:50.470 --> 01:06:50.480 align:start position:0%
um you know minimize um the seriousness
 
01:06:53.109 --> 01:06:53.119 align:start position:0%
of those offenses number one if they are
 
01:06:55.349 --> 01:06:55.359 align:start position:0%
proven to be true right um and one thing
 
01:06:57.109 --> 01:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
to keep in mind is that when we're
 
01:06:58.670 --> 01:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
talking about bail all of these people
 
01:07:02.630 --> 01:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
are Presumed Innocent um and um and so
 
01:07:04.349 --> 01:07:04.359 align:start position:0%
that's you know that that's a very big
 
01:07:07.750 --> 01:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
factor but even even um kind
 
01:07:10.789 --> 01:07:10.799 align:start position:0%
of the even kind of a not assuming that
 
01:07:12.470 --> 01:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
these folks are guilty but assuming that
 
01:07:13.950 --> 01:07:13.960 align:start position:0%
you know that these are serious
 
01:07:16.269 --> 01:07:16.279 align:start position:0%
potentially a serious offenses um some
 
01:07:17.950 --> 01:07:17.960 align:start position:0%
of these folks you know might need to be
 
01:07:20.349 --> 01:07:20.359 align:start position:0%
held um and and don't get me wrong you
 
01:07:22.549 --> 01:07:22.559 align:start position:0%
know this list of offenses people do get
 
01:07:24.349 --> 01:07:24.359 align:start position:0%
held for these offenses under current
 
01:07:27.190 --> 01:07:27.200 align:start position:0%
statutory scheme um so that's you know
 
01:07:28.430 --> 01:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
that's one of the points that I want to
 
01:07:30.789 --> 01:07:30.799 align:start position:0%
make I know you've heard that um you
 
01:07:32.269 --> 01:07:32.279 align:start position:0%
know it it sounds like maybe you're
 
01:07:33.589 --> 01:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
hearing a little bit that the bail
 
01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner system is broken I mean the
 
01:07:37.470 --> 01:07:37.480 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner system is not perfect
 
01:07:40.549 --> 01:07:40.559 align:start position:0%
but it offers um a lot of benefit in
 
01:07:43.349 --> 01:07:43.359 align:start position:0%
that it's a you know an a relatively
 
01:07:45.870 --> 01:07:45.880 align:start position:0%
quick um way to assess somebody for
 
01:07:48.390 --> 01:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
whether they are appropriate for release
 
01:07:50.829 --> 01:07:50.839 align:start position:0%
um and you know so it's not as if seeing
 
01:07:52.230 --> 01:07:52.240 align:start position:0%
a bail commissioner means that you're
 
01:07:53.510 --> 01:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
never going to get held for those
 
01:07:56.029 --> 01:07:56.039 align:start position:0%
offenses is this list of offenses this
 
01:07:58.150 --> 01:07:58.160 align:start position:0%
list of 12 to 13 people get held for
 
01:08:00.069 --> 01:08:00.079 align:start position:0%
these offenses all the time and then it
 
01:08:01.870 --> 01:08:01.880 align:start position:0%
goes for a judge and they do have a bail
 
01:08:04.510 --> 01:08:04.520 align:start position:0%
hearing um but the the fact that there
 
01:08:07.430 --> 01:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
are people who are charged with these
 
01:08:09.230 --> 01:08:09.240 align:start position:0%
more serious offenses with aggravated
 
01:08:11.390 --> 01:08:11.400 align:start position:0%
fonia sexual assault with you know
 
01:08:14.069 --> 01:08:14.079 align:start position:0%
possession of child pornography um you
 
01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
know with second deegree assault um
 
01:08:18.669 --> 01:08:18.679 align:start position:0%
domestic violence um the fact that those
 
01:08:20.149 --> 01:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
people see a bail commissioner and are
 
01:08:22.950 --> 01:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
still released um tells you uh that
 
01:08:25.229 --> 01:08:25.239 align:start position:0%
those are not people who need to be held
 
01:08:27.990 --> 01:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
um and um this list of offenses and I'll
 
01:08:29.749 --> 01:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
talk kind of separately about people who
 
01:08:32.430 --> 01:08:32.440 align:start position:0%
violate bail and I can address that but
 
01:08:33.990 --> 01:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of just looking at their
 
01:08:35.709 --> 01:08:35.719 align:start position:0%
charges and saying look you you don't
 
01:08:37.149 --> 01:08:37.159 align:start position:0%
deserve to see a bail commissioner you
 
01:08:39.789 --> 01:08:39.799 align:start position:0%
need to see a judge you need to be held
 
01:08:43.829 --> 01:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
um you know I think that it's it's easy
 
01:08:46.510 --> 01:08:46.520 align:start position:0%
um to sort of rely on anecdotes in that
 
01:08:49.149 --> 01:08:49.159 align:start position:0%
regard um but you know to say that oh
 
01:08:51.269 --> 01:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
this this particular offense you know
 
01:08:52.709 --> 01:08:52.719 align:start position:0%
here's this one thing I read about in
 
01:08:54.910 --> 01:08:54.920 align:start position:0%
the newspaper um that person I can't
 
01:08:57.309 --> 01:08:57.319 align:start position:0%
believe that they were released on bail
 
01:08:58.950 --> 01:08:58.960 align:start position:0%
um and I think some of that comes back
 
01:09:00.829 --> 01:09:00.839 align:start position:0%
to more of the people who are accused of
 
01:09:03.349 --> 01:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
violating their bail but in terms of um
 
01:09:05.590 --> 01:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
you know these lists of offenses uh you
 
01:09:08.829 --> 01:09:08.839 align:start position:0%
know number one um you know I there is
 
01:09:11.229 --> 01:09:11.239 align:start position:0%
in the the the fiscal note to Senate
 
01:09:13.709 --> 01:09:13.719 align:start position:0%
Bill 252 gets gets into this in
 
01:09:15.829 --> 01:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
particular um there are misdemeanor
 
01:09:17.990 --> 01:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
charges that are on this list um and so
 
01:09:19.709 --> 01:09:19.719 align:start position:0%
the idea that you would not be able to
 
01:09:21.110 --> 01:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
see a bail commissioner and that you
 
01:09:24.309 --> 01:09:24.319 align:start position:0%
were going to be held U per se just
 
01:09:28.349 --> 01:09:28.359 align:start position:0%
um on misdemeanor charges um is um you
 
01:09:31.030 --> 01:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
know it we would be incarcerating people
 
01:09:32.390 --> 01:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
who would otherwise never be
 
01:09:35.229 --> 01:09:35.239 align:start position:0%
incarcerated um and um some of you might
 
01:09:37.669 --> 01:09:37.679 align:start position:0%
have you know seen research about you
 
01:09:40.030 --> 01:09:40.040 align:start position:0%
know even two nights in jail and the you
 
01:09:42.149 --> 01:09:42.159 align:start position:0%
know terrible impact that that can have
 
01:09:43.630 --> 01:09:43.640 align:start position:0%
on your life you know the way it can
 
01:09:46.229 --> 01:09:46.239 align:start position:0%
just make your life unravel um in terms
 
01:09:48.829 --> 01:09:48.839 align:start position:0%
of losing housing losing Insurance
 
01:09:52.550 --> 01:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
losing jobs losing child custody um and
 
01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
then also the trauma ass associated with
 
01:09:57.790 --> 01:09:57.800 align:start position:0%
spending any time in jail um but um you
 
01:10:00.030 --> 01:10:00.040 align:start position:0%
know beyond that the the fiscal note for
 
01:10:02.310 --> 01:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 252 talks about the
 
01:10:04.430 --> 01:10:04.440 align:start position:0%
incredible volume of bail hearings that
 
01:10:06.669 --> 01:10:06.679 align:start position:0%
that will result in and I can say
 
01:10:09.470 --> 01:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
unequivocally if um you know domestic
 
01:10:13.030 --> 01:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
violence under RSA 631 Tob is just per
 
01:10:14.350 --> 01:10:14.360 align:start position:0%
se you don't get to see a bail
 
01:10:18.110 --> 01:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner that will result in just an
 
01:10:20.590 --> 01:10:20.600 align:start position:0%
astronomical number uh of bail hearings
 
01:10:22.470 --> 01:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
that the system is just not at all
 
01:10:24.430 --> 01:10:24.440 align:start position:0%
prepared to absorb
 
01:10:26.830 --> 01:10:26.840 align:start position:0%
um I'm talking about the misdemeanor
 
01:10:29.910 --> 01:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
level in particular um and then also I I
 
01:10:33.390 --> 01:10:33.400 align:start position:0%
want to kind of talk to I know I I again
 
01:10:35.030 --> 01:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
don't want to to be seen as kind of
 
01:10:36.750 --> 01:10:36.760 align:start position:0%
minimizing oh it's just misdemeanor
 
01:10:38.270 --> 01:10:38.280 align:start position:0%
domestic violence any domestic violence
 
01:10:40.229 --> 01:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
if it's true you know needs to be
 
01:10:44.189 --> 01:10:44.199 align:start position:0%
addressed um but um these charges
 
01:10:46.350 --> 01:10:46.360 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor domestic violence is any
 
01:10:50.189 --> 01:10:50.199 align:start position:0%
unprivileged physical contact um and um
 
01:10:52.990 --> 01:10:53.000 align:start position:0%
you know not to to fight anecdotes with
 
01:10:54.550 --> 01:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
anecdotes but but I can tell you my
 
01:10:56.390 --> 01:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
first bench trial when I was a b brand
 
01:10:58.189 --> 01:10:58.199 align:start position:0%
new lawyer was on a misdemeanor uh
 
01:11:00.070 --> 01:11:00.080 align:start position:0%
simple assault domestic violence charge
 
01:11:02.590 --> 01:11:02.600 align:start position:0%
and my client was charged with a shower
 
01:11:04.750 --> 01:11:04.760 align:start position:0%
poof you know the the fluffy little poof
 
01:11:06.790 --> 01:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
um he threw it at his he was charged
 
01:11:09.149 --> 01:11:09.159 align:start position:0%
with throwing it at his partner um and
 
01:11:11.189 --> 01:11:11.199 align:start position:0%
that was a misdemeanor domestic violence
 
01:11:13.470 --> 01:11:13.480 align:start position:0%
charge um and that's not just an
 
01:11:15.390 --> 01:11:15.400 align:start position:0%
anecdote I mean that is it is literally
 
01:11:18.110 --> 01:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
if I walk I brush past your shoulder as
 
01:11:20.229 --> 01:11:20.239 align:start position:0%
I walk through a doorway um you know
 
01:11:22.229 --> 01:11:22.239 align:start position:0%
there's just any you know unprivileged
 
01:11:24.709 --> 01:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
contact and that's what we're talking
 
01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
about I'm sorry know knowing yes it
 
01:11:29.470 --> 01:11:29.480 align:start position:0%
can't be act it has to be knowing yeah
 
01:11:31.910 --> 01:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
not necessarily intentional but knowing
 
01:11:35.030 --> 01:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
um so you know and then also when we
 
01:11:37.149 --> 01:11:37.159 align:start position:0%
look at like misdemeanor stalking under
 
01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
633 3A um you know I think that stalking
 
01:11:43.629 --> 01:11:43.639 align:start position:0%
of often conjures up an image of
 
01:11:46.350 --> 01:11:46.360 align:start position:0%
somebody you know hiding out outside in
 
01:11:47.910 --> 01:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
your bushes behind you know at your in
 
01:11:49.830 --> 01:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
front of your house um you know sitting
 
01:11:51.470 --> 01:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
in your car in their car you know
 
01:11:53.510 --> 01:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
waiting for you um you know stop
 
01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
stalking is essentially um you know if
 
01:11:59.709 --> 01:11:59.719 align:start position:0%
you violate a no contact order um and so
 
01:12:02.950 --> 01:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
almost the vast majority of these are um
 
01:12:05.310 --> 01:12:05.320 align:start position:0%
you know text messages and phone calls
 
01:12:07.669 --> 01:12:07.679 align:start position:0%
and a very good percentage of those are
 
01:12:09.870 --> 01:12:09.880 align:start position:0%
actually contact that is initiated by
 
01:12:12.550 --> 01:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
the alleged victim that the defendant is
 
01:12:15.430 --> 01:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
responding to um which again you know
 
01:12:17.350 --> 01:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
this defendant has either a bail order
 
01:12:19.189 --> 01:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
or a protective order you know something
 
01:12:20.390 --> 01:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
that says that they're not supposed to
 
01:12:22.910 --> 01:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
do that so um I'm not saying that these
 
01:12:25.510 --> 01:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
charges um come out of nowhere but when
 
01:12:27.149 --> 01:12:27.159 align:start position:0%
we think about are they a danger to the
 
01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
community for sending a text message you
 
01:12:37.830 --> 01:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:42.070 --> 01:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:44.189 --> 01:12:44.199 align:start position:0%
correct it's actually right so it
 
01:12:46.110 --> 01:12:46.120 align:start position:0%
depends on how the police department or
 
01:12:48.669 --> 01:12:48.679 align:start position:0%
the prosecutor's office charges it um
 
01:12:51.270 --> 01:12:51.280 align:start position:0%
but a lot of times um the stocking is
 
01:12:54.229 --> 01:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
used um for that purpose that's
 
01:12:57.669 --> 01:12:57.679 align:start position:0%
correct um and then you know to move on
 
01:13:00.310 --> 01:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
to um you know even second degree
 
01:13:03.110 --> 01:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
assault um under
 
01:13:06.590 --> 01:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
6312 um you know those those offenses
 
01:13:09.030 --> 01:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
can similarly be you know minor
 
01:13:11.550 --> 01:13:11.560 align:start position:0%
relatively minor in in nature um you
 
01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
know contact that does not result in any
 
01:13:17.510 --> 01:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
kind of injury um um and uh you know I
 
01:13:19.709 --> 01:13:19.719 align:start position:0%
think that often in the domestic
 
01:13:22.310 --> 01:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
violence contact UM those are
 
01:13:24.110 --> 01:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
allegations of choking
 
01:13:26.669 --> 01:13:26.679 align:start position:0%
um you know often there is really no
 
01:13:29.030 --> 01:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
evidence to support that um and we often
 
01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
in contested bail hearings um you know
 
01:13:33.950 --> 01:13:33.960 align:start position:0%
when contested bail hearings you know
 
01:13:36.629 --> 01:13:36.639 align:start position:0%
because of lack of evidence but also um
 
01:13:39.229 --> 01:13:39.239 align:start position:0%
because it it sounds when you hear the
 
01:13:41.390 --> 01:13:41.400 align:start position:0%
word choking it it can sound more
 
01:13:42.590 --> 01:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
serious than really when you hear a
 
01:13:44.070 --> 01:13:44.080 align:start position:0%
little bit more about the facts of the
 
01:13:46.430 --> 01:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
case or and in combination of hearing
 
01:13:49.149 --> 01:13:49.159 align:start position:0%
more about you know the fact that a
 
01:13:51.030 --> 01:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
defendant you know has a place to live
 
01:13:52.709 --> 01:13:52.719 align:start position:0%
that is nowhere you know has nothing to
 
01:13:54.790 --> 01:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
do with the alleg victim you know has a
 
01:13:57.470 --> 01:13:57.480 align:start position:0%
job um you know has other factors that
 
01:13:59.870 --> 01:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
make them a good candidate for bail um
 
01:14:01.310 --> 01:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
these are again people that the bail
 
01:14:03.229 --> 01:14:03.239 align:start position:0%
Commissioners are seeing and are are
 
01:14:06.270 --> 01:14:06.280 align:start position:0%
deciding um that they can be released um
 
01:14:08.990 --> 01:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
that they don't need to be held um and
 
01:14:11.669 --> 01:14:11.679 align:start position:0%
then even again the the more serious uh
 
01:14:13.790 --> 01:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
offenses that are listed here aggravated
 
01:14:16.750 --> 01:14:16.760 align:start position:0%
fonia sexual assault uh and fonia sexual
 
01:14:20.070 --> 01:14:20.080 align:start position:0%
assault um and you know possession um of
 
01:14:22.270 --> 01:14:22.280 align:start position:0%
child abuse sexual images or computer
 
01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:26.080 align:start position:0%
pornography um you know those charges um
 
01:14:28.550 --> 01:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
often those those those clients those
 
01:14:31.070 --> 01:14:31.080 align:start position:0%
defendants are are getting bail um and
 
01:14:32.750 --> 01:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
you that might be surprising to folks
 
01:14:34.709 --> 01:14:34.719 align:start position:0%
how could you be charged with rape or
 
01:14:36.709 --> 01:14:36.719 align:start position:0%
possession of child pornography and get
 
01:14:39.350 --> 01:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
bail um you know again I think I would
 
01:14:41.629 --> 01:14:41.639 align:start position:0%
come back to number one you know that
 
01:14:44.629 --> 01:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
the presumption of innocence um but you
 
01:14:46.470 --> 01:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
know a lot more than that it is very
 
01:14:49.110 --> 01:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
common for charges in those in those
 
01:14:53.110 --> 01:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
scenarios particularly uh afsa and FSA
 
01:14:57.229 --> 01:14:57.239 align:start position:0%
um to be to be old um you know the
 
01:15:00.110 --> 01:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
allegations are from several years prior
 
01:15:02.750 --> 01:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
um they are not recent allegations in a
 
01:15:06.149 --> 01:15:06.159 align:start position:0%
lot of instances um for various reasons
 
01:15:10.910 --> 01:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
um and um so often um you know the the
 
01:15:14.790 --> 01:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
defendant has no contact anymore with um
 
01:15:16.669 --> 01:15:16.679 align:start position:0%
you know with the alleged victim or or
 
01:15:19.470 --> 01:15:19.480 align:start position:0%
their family um and then again these are
 
01:15:21.910 --> 01:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
often people who have other factors that
 
01:15:23.830 --> 01:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
make them good candidates for because
 
01:15:25.830 --> 01:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
we're not punishing them at this phase
 
01:15:27.430 --> 01:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
for committing this offense we're
 
01:15:30.709 --> 01:15:30.719 align:start position:0%
deciding are they you know a safe um
 
01:15:33.510 --> 01:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
person to release into the community uh
 
01:15:35.550 --> 01:15:35.560 align:start position:0%
and these people charged with these
 
01:15:37.629 --> 01:15:37.639 align:start position:0%
offenses very often have no criminal
 
01:15:40.590 --> 01:15:40.600 align:start position:0%
record um and have stability have
 
01:15:43.990 --> 01:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
housing have jobs um and so and then
 
01:15:46.149 --> 01:15:46.159 align:start position:0%
also have the ability to add a number of
 
01:15:50.070 --> 01:15:50.080 align:start position:0%
bail conditions um that that assure you
 
01:15:51.950 --> 01:15:51.960 align:start position:0%
know for instance no contact but also
 
01:15:54.270 --> 01:15:54.280 align:start position:0%
can assure um that they not use
 
01:15:56.390 --> 01:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
electronic devices um you know as
 
01:15:59.270 --> 01:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
particularly in child pornography cases
 
01:16:01.310 --> 01:16:01.320 align:start position:0%
um and things like that so there are
 
01:16:03.149 --> 01:16:03.159 align:start position:0%
bail conditions that can be set for
 
01:16:07.070 --> 01:16:07.080 align:start position:0%
these folks and um you know I think in
 
01:16:09.709 --> 01:16:09.719 align:start position:0%
my 16 years of experience people charged
 
01:16:11.750 --> 01:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
with those higher level
 
01:16:14.990 --> 01:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
offenses F afsa FSA you know the child
 
01:16:18.550 --> 01:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
porn charges um are actually not prone
 
01:16:20.510 --> 01:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
to violating their bail or even their
 
01:16:22.470 --> 01:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
conditions of bail um you know these are
 
01:16:24.149 --> 01:16:24.159 align:start position:0%
not the folks that we are seeing you
 
01:16:25.790 --> 01:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
know you hear about this kind of
 
01:16:27.910 --> 01:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
revolving door and those are folks who
 
01:16:29.510 --> 01:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
are struggling with substance use
 
01:16:32.629 --> 01:16:32.639 align:start position:0%
disorder and with homelessness um and
 
01:16:34.149 --> 01:16:34.159 align:start position:0%
that you know who are charged with
 
01:16:36.470 --> 01:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
possession or thefts or things of that
 
01:16:37.709 --> 01:16:37.719 align:start position:0%
nature that are related to their
 
01:16:40.350 --> 01:16:40.360 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder um these are
 
01:16:43.750 --> 01:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
people um who again have a lot more
 
01:16:45.430 --> 01:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
stability and are good candidates for
 
01:16:47.310 --> 01:16:47.320 align:start position:0%
bail and who follow their bail
 
01:16:48.590 --> 01:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
conditions when you tell them not to
 
01:16:51.669 --> 01:16:51.679 align:start position:0%
have contact um you know they they abide
 
01:16:54.110 --> 01:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
by that and they largely um you know
 
01:16:55.990 --> 01:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
remain out on bail um because the
 
01:16:58.229 --> 01:16:58.239 align:start position:0%
alternative is is what you just heard
 
01:17:00.350 --> 01:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
about pre you know that previously is
 
01:17:02.470 --> 01:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
that there's people um sitting in jail
 
01:17:05.270 --> 01:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
for more than a year pre-trial um who
 
01:17:06.790 --> 01:17:06.800 align:start position:0%
otherwise you know potentially with some
 
01:17:08.750 --> 01:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
of the options that you you seem that
 
01:17:10.310 --> 01:17:10.320 align:start position:0%
you are exploring here in this committee
 
01:17:12.590 --> 01:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
like electronic monitoring and pre-trial
 
01:17:16.030 --> 01:17:16.040 align:start position:0%
Services um would would have been um an
 
01:17:18.070 --> 01:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
excellent candidate for those kinds of
 
01:17:21.270 --> 01:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
programs um you know I I don't work in
 
01:17:22.830 --> 01:17:22.840 align:start position:0%
corrections but you ask the question you
 
01:17:24.669 --> 01:17:24.679 align:start position:0%
know is that a cost savings you know
 
01:17:27.669 --> 01:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
those types of programs um you know I I
 
01:17:29.830 --> 01:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
believe that they are um and a cost
 
01:17:32.149 --> 01:17:32.159 align:start position:0%
savings also you know to the public
 
01:17:34.910 --> 01:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
defender program as well um and that
 
01:17:36.750 --> 01:17:36.760 align:start position:0%
kind of leads into you know the next
 
01:17:38.350 --> 01:17:38.360 align:start position:0%
category which is you know people who
 
01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
violate their bail and how do we address
 
01:17:43.510 --> 01:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
um the idea that you know there's people
 
01:17:46.629 --> 01:17:46.639 align:start position:0%
who kind of come back again and again um
 
01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
you know number one I I don't um I
 
01:17:53.189 --> 01:17:53.199 align:start position:0%
haven't seen a lot of data that that
 
01:17:55.669 --> 01:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
really actual hard empirical data that
 
01:17:58.390 --> 01:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
demonstrates that this is somehow um
 
01:17:59.790 --> 01:17:59.800 align:start position:0%
that there's been a spike in this
 
01:18:02.510 --> 01:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
happening um you know that there's some
 
01:18:06.510 --> 01:18:06.520 align:start position:0%
sort of um you know epidemic of of bail
 
01:18:08.790 --> 01:18:08.800 align:start position:0%
violations that are going around um you
 
01:18:12.510 --> 01:18:12.520 align:start position:0%
know we do have um we have very real
 
01:18:14.350 --> 01:18:14.360 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder problems in this
 
01:18:18.149 --> 01:18:18.159 align:start position:0%
state um we have um you know act a big
 
01:18:20.830 --> 01:18:20.840 align:start position:0%
Mental Health crisis we don't y I ask
 
01:18:23.669 --> 01:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
you a question about the data yes um
 
01:18:25.149 --> 01:18:25.159 align:start position:0%
do you have a source of data that we're
 
01:18:27.470 --> 01:18:27.480 align:start position:0%
not available because we can't it
 
01:18:29.030 --> 01:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to be a place you can get
 
01:18:31.270 --> 01:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
data that's kind of what I was saying I
 
01:18:33.149 --> 01:18:33.159 align:start position:0%
was saying I I haven't seen data that
 
01:18:35.070 --> 01:18:35.080 align:start position:0%
actually says it doesn't exist so we
 
01:18:37.070 --> 01:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
have to rely on what we hear from from
 
01:18:38.669 --> 01:18:38.679 align:start position:0%
the law enforcement from the bail
 
01:18:42.470 --> 01:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
Commissioners from the jails I mean I I
 
01:18:44.070 --> 01:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
I hate to rely on anecdotes but that's
 
01:18:45.910 --> 01:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
all we have because we we don't have a
 
01:18:48.550 --> 01:18:48.560 align:start position:0%
way to pull thata based on the the the
 
01:18:51.590 --> 01:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
fractured court system we have it so if
 
01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
you have a a good source of data we
 
01:18:55.350 --> 01:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
would love to hear it but so sure so I
 
01:18:58.870 --> 01:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
mean I my system doesn't also doesn't
 
01:19:01.270 --> 01:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
provide for tracking like somebody was
 
01:19:04.229 --> 01:19:04.239 align:start position:0%
out on bail um and returns you know to
 
01:19:06.990 --> 01:19:07.000 align:start position:0%
jail um I don't from my system I don't
 
01:19:10.510 --> 01:19:10.520 align:start position:0%
have um the ability to track that um and
 
01:19:12.149 --> 01:19:12.159 align:start position:0%
so I certainly appreciate your point
 
01:19:13.830 --> 01:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
then you know what else can we do I
 
01:19:15.709 --> 01:19:15.719 align:start position:0%
guess I can share my perspective then
 
01:19:18.550 --> 01:19:18.560 align:start position:0%
you know doing this work for 16 years um
 
01:19:21.430 --> 01:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
you know certainly the opioid um you
 
01:19:24.030 --> 01:19:24.040 align:start position:0%
know pandemic that we suffered or we're
 
01:19:26.430 --> 01:19:26.440 align:start position:0%
still suffering in this state has
 
01:19:28.750 --> 01:19:28.760 align:start position:0%
increased you know people who are who
 
01:19:31.910 --> 01:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
are sick um and who are struggling um
 
01:19:34.950 --> 01:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
but um and I I don't from my point of
 
01:19:36.750 --> 01:19:36.760 align:start position:0%
view I have not seen some sort of
 
01:19:39.110 --> 01:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
explosion it it's been pretty persistent
 
01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
I mean there there is a population of
 
01:19:43.990 --> 01:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
people who struggle with homelessness um
 
01:19:46.310 --> 01:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
in particular I think because right now
 
01:19:48.430 --> 01:19:48.440 align:start position:0%
we're talking about you know violating
 
01:19:51.110 --> 01:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
bail um by almost always committing a
 
01:19:53.270 --> 01:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
new drug offense um or you know maybe
 
01:19:54.990 --> 01:19:55.000 align:start position:0%
you missed court because you're homeless
 
01:19:56.350 --> 01:19:56.360 align:start position:0%
and then when they you get arrested on
 
01:19:57.709 --> 01:19:57.719 align:start position:0%
that warrant you have drugs in your
 
01:19:59.030 --> 01:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
possession a small amount of drugs in
 
01:20:03.270 --> 01:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
your possession um and so I want to
 
01:20:05.669 --> 01:20:05.679 align:start position:0%
emphasize though that the current bail
 
01:20:08.229 --> 01:20:08.239 align:start position:0%
scheme already has solutions to those
 
01:20:10.709 --> 01:20:10.719 align:start position:0%
issues um you know there are ways to to
 
01:20:13.550 --> 01:20:13.560 align:start position:0%
revoke bail if it's serious enough um
 
01:20:16.189 --> 01:20:16.199 align:start position:0%
there are ways um to factor in failures
 
01:20:20.709 --> 01:20:20.719 align:start position:0%
to appear when deciding on bail um and
 
01:20:22.550 --> 01:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
uh you know there are ways certainly if
 
01:20:24.550 --> 01:20:24.560 align:start position:0%
you get arrested for a new offense and a
 
01:20:25.950 --> 01:20:25.960 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner sees that you're
 
01:20:28.669 --> 01:20:28.679 align:start position:0%
already out on bail um he might not he
 
01:20:30.229 --> 01:20:30.239 align:start position:0%
or she might not release you and might
 
01:20:32.310 --> 01:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
have you wait to see a judge to decide
 
01:20:35.070 --> 01:20:35.080 align:start position:0%
if if you should get out um so there's
 
01:20:37.830 --> 01:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
already these mechanisms that exist um
 
01:20:40.550 --> 01:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
to to deal with people who are accused
 
01:20:42.149 --> 01:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
of violating the conditions of their
 
01:20:45.070 --> 01:20:45.080 align:start position:0%
bail um and by and large the people who
 
01:20:47.590 --> 01:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
are accused of that are not violent
 
01:20:48.950 --> 01:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
people who are out committing new
 
01:20:50.950 --> 01:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
violent offenses um these are people who
 
01:20:52.470 --> 01:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
are just still struggling with their
 
01:20:53.629 --> 01:20:53.639 align:start position:0%
mental mental health and with their
 
01:20:55.390 --> 01:20:55.400 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder issues and with
 
01:20:57.790 --> 01:20:57.800 align:start position:0%
their homelessness um and so the
 
01:21:00.310 --> 01:21:00.320 align:start position:0%
solution for that um is not to hold them
 
01:21:02.229 --> 01:21:02.239 align:start position:0%
in jail and I don't just say that from
 
01:21:05.430 --> 01:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
my public defender heart right um I say
 
01:21:08.470 --> 01:21:08.480 align:start position:0%
that um in that it it doesn't it doesn't
 
01:21:11.310 --> 01:21:11.320 align:start position:0%
work it just doesn't solve anything um
 
01:21:14.310 --> 01:21:14.320 align:start position:0%
and so given that that these potential
 
01:21:17.470 --> 01:21:17.480 align:start position:0%
changes to the bail statute would cost I
 
01:21:19.510 --> 01:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
I think would result in costs um to the
 
01:21:21.310 --> 01:21:21.320 align:start position:0%
public defender to Prosecutor's offices
 
01:21:23.430 --> 01:21:23.440 align:start position:0%
to the courts um and it sounds like you
 
01:21:24.950 --> 01:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
already doing this but I would encourage
 
01:21:26.950 --> 01:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
you if we're going to incur costs it
 
01:21:29.790 --> 01:21:29.800 align:start position:0%
should be um to spread pre-trial service
 
01:21:31.790 --> 01:21:31.800 align:start position:0%
programs um you know I'm familiar
 
01:21:33.629 --> 01:21:33.639 align:start position:0%
somewhat with the programs here in marac
 
01:21:36.550 --> 01:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
County the program in stford County um
 
01:21:38.950 --> 01:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
they are excellent models um and I think
 
01:21:40.830 --> 01:21:40.840 align:start position:0%
that you know much like now drug court
 
01:21:43.950 --> 01:21:43.960 align:start position:0%
is statutory and Statewide um you know I
 
01:21:45.790 --> 01:21:45.800 align:start position:0%
think that pre-trial Services should be
 
01:21:48.629 --> 01:21:48.639 align:start position:0%
statutory and Statewide um I think that
 
01:21:51.310 --> 01:21:51.320 align:start position:0%
you know diversion programs um so those
 
01:21:55.390 --> 01:21:55.400 align:start position:0%
are programs where um you um it's
 
01:21:57.149 --> 01:21:57.159 align:start position:0%
essentially if you complete a pre-trial
 
01:21:59.669 --> 01:21:59.679 align:start position:0%
Services type program or a divers or
 
01:22:02.470 --> 01:22:02.480 align:start position:0%
this this type of program supervision
 
01:22:04.430 --> 01:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
pre-trial with with conditions with
 
01:22:07.149 --> 01:22:07.159 align:start position:0%
treatment with a treatment plan for you
 
01:22:09.950 --> 01:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
if you complete that you can avoid um
 
01:22:12.950 --> 01:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
you know you can avoid conviction um and
 
01:22:14.990 --> 01:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
I I think that those are the areas that
 
01:22:16.910 --> 01:22:16.920 align:start position:0%
that we need to focus on and those are
 
01:22:18.950 --> 01:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
areas that are much easier for my office
 
01:22:22.669 --> 01:22:22.679 align:start position:0%
to staff right we can we can deal with
 
01:22:24.830 --> 01:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
um you know even if the client has
 
01:22:28.629 --> 01:22:28.639 align:start position:0%
regular planned um scheduled court dates
 
01:22:30.229 --> 01:22:30.239 align:start position:0%
to comply with their pre-trial
 
01:22:31.910 --> 01:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
supervision program which largely they
 
01:22:34.510 --> 01:22:34.520 align:start position:0%
don't um usually once somebody's put on
 
01:22:36.350 --> 01:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
pre-trial Services you know we the
 
01:22:37.910 --> 01:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
public defender the lawyer obviously
 
01:22:39.510 --> 01:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
that's our client and we keep in touch
 
01:22:41.070 --> 01:22:41.080 align:start position:0%
with our client and we work on their
 
01:22:43.750 --> 01:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
case but we don't necessarily it doesn't
 
01:22:46.990 --> 01:22:47.000 align:start position:0%
cost us you know extra time or money for
 
01:22:49.030 --> 01:22:49.040 align:start position:0%
our clients to be on pre-trial Services
 
01:22:51.110 --> 01:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
now if they're violating that then you
 
01:22:52.950 --> 01:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
know we might have to have a hearing ing
 
01:22:55.910 --> 01:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh in front of the judge about that um
 
01:22:57.430 --> 01:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
but again that's a scheduled hearing and
 
01:22:59.229 --> 01:22:59.239 align:start position:0%
it's not one of these same day hearings
 
01:23:01.189 --> 01:23:01.199 align:start position:0%
that are so very difficult for our
 
01:23:03.550 --> 01:23:03.560 align:start position:0%
office to staff um you know those are
 
01:23:05.870 --> 01:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
the areas that I think that to the
 
01:23:08.149 --> 01:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
extent that there is a desire in the
 
01:23:10.550 --> 01:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
community to address uh you know people
 
01:23:12.550 --> 01:23:12.560 align:start position:0%
who are not complying with with bail
 
01:23:14.270 --> 01:23:14.280 align:start position:0%
conditions who are committing alleged to
 
01:23:16.030 --> 01:23:16.040 align:start position:0%
have committed new offenses while at on
 
01:23:18.390 --> 01:23:18.400 align:start position:0%
bail um those are the solutions that are
 
01:23:19.990 --> 01:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
actually going to impact change because
 
01:23:23.070 --> 01:23:23.080 align:start position:0%
not only um is that person
 
01:23:24.830 --> 01:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
um you know going to we're going to save
 
01:23:26.470 --> 01:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
money by not just warehousing that
 
01:23:28.550 --> 01:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
person um you know like you just heard
 
01:23:30.590 --> 01:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
spending money for medicating them and
 
01:23:33.070 --> 01:23:33.080 align:start position:0%
treating you know as as you just heard
 
01:23:35.709 --> 01:23:35.719 align:start position:0%
about you know when you get to jail kind
 
01:23:37.669 --> 01:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
of then they start helping you with
 
01:23:39.910 --> 01:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
medical issues that that have just gone
 
01:23:41.669 --> 01:23:41.679 align:start position:0%
unaddressed for a very long period of
 
01:23:44.990 --> 01:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
time um but I think also you know it's
 
01:23:47.470 --> 01:23:47.480 align:start position:0%
not going to address recidivism if we
 
01:23:49.390 --> 01:23:49.400 align:start position:0%
you know even if we hold this client
 
01:23:52.950 --> 01:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
because they violated their bail um you
 
01:23:55.430 --> 01:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
know they're going to be released you
 
01:23:56.669 --> 01:23:56.679 align:start position:0%
know they're not going to get life
 
01:24:00.030 --> 01:24:00.040 align:start position:0%
sentences for um you know for for you
 
01:24:01.470 --> 01:24:01.480 align:start position:0%
know possession of drugs and then
 
01:24:02.830 --> 01:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
possessing more drugs while you're out
 
01:24:05.590 --> 01:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
on bail um you know these are you're
 
01:24:07.790 --> 01:24:07.800 align:start position:0%
going to get out um and these are people
 
01:24:09.790 --> 01:24:09.800 align:start position:0%
who largely the reason another reason I
 
01:24:12.830 --> 01:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
want to come back to um why you know
 
01:24:14.590 --> 01:24:14.600 align:start position:0%
judges are not holding these folks is
 
01:24:16.149 --> 01:24:16.159 align:start position:0%
not because they don't care that they're
 
01:24:18.189 --> 01:24:18.199 align:start position:0%
not violating their bail it's because
 
01:24:19.750 --> 01:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
these offenses are just simply not worth
 
01:24:22.510 --> 01:24:22.520 align:start position:0%
jail time um and so to house them
 
01:24:24.629 --> 01:24:24.639 align:start position:0%
pre-trial for things that you know if
 
01:24:26.510 --> 01:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
they went to trial and they lost they
 
01:24:28.270 --> 01:24:28.280 align:start position:0%
still would not get a stand committed
 
01:24:31.189 --> 01:24:31.199 align:start position:0%
sentence um is is really unjust and and
 
01:24:31.199 --> 01:24:31.950 align:start position:0%
sentence um is is really unjust and and
not

01:24:31.950 --> 01:24:31.960 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:24:36.629 --> 01:24:36.639 align:start position:0%
costeffective um but um so if we if we
 
01:24:38.590 --> 01:24:38.600 align:start position:0%
invest in these other types of programs
 
01:24:41.830 --> 01:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
it it will hopefully and not for every
 
01:24:44.470 --> 01:24:44.480 align:start position:0%
single person but result in in in kind
 
01:24:47.270 --> 01:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
of breaking the cycle and not so if we
 
01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
say okay you violated your bail and so
 
01:24:50.229 --> 01:24:50.239 align:start position:0%
you're going to sit in jail for three
 
01:24:52.350 --> 01:24:52.360 align:start position:0%
months while while either you work out a
 
01:24:54.109 --> 01:24:54.119 align:start position:0%
plea agreement or we have your trial or
 
01:24:55.870 --> 01:24:55.880 align:start position:0%
whatever you're still going to get out
 
01:24:58.470 --> 01:24:58.480 align:start position:0%
after that 3 months and all we've done
 
01:25:01.510 --> 01:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
is hold you in a jail um and you know
 
01:25:02.830 --> 01:25:02.840 align:start position:0%
there some of the jails do have
 
01:25:05.149 --> 01:25:05.159 align:start position:0%
programming um but you know there's a
 
01:25:07.470 --> 01:25:07.480 align:start position:0%
lot of research about you know
 
01:25:09.629 --> 01:25:09.639 align:start position:0%
programming in carceral settings um are
 
01:25:11.990 --> 01:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
not are not very effective not nearly as
 
01:25:13.950 --> 01:25:13.960 align:start position:0%
effective as uh treatment in the
 
01:25:16.750 --> 01:25:16.760 align:start position:0%
community um but also in a lot of times
 
01:25:18.109 --> 01:25:18.119 align:start position:0%
you know this availability of
 
01:25:20.830 --> 01:25:20.840 align:start position:0%
programming particularly pre-trial um
 
01:25:22.350 --> 01:25:22.360 align:start position:0%
you know there aren't many counties that
 
01:25:24.310 --> 01:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
have pre-trial programming it's it's for
 
01:25:26.950 --> 01:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
sentenced individuals um you know we're
 
01:25:28.910 --> 01:25:28.920 align:start position:0%
just they're just they're just killing
 
01:25:31.430 --> 01:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
time in jail um and they're having
 
01:25:33.830 --> 01:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
minimal to no treatment um and then they
 
01:25:36.189 --> 01:25:36.199 align:start position:0%
get out you know after we held them
 
01:25:38.030 --> 01:25:38.040 align:start position:0%
because you know because they you know
 
01:25:39.830 --> 01:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
violated their bail they're still going
 
01:25:42.430 --> 01:25:42.440 align:start position:0%
to be released in relatively short order
 
01:25:44.109 --> 01:25:44.119 align:start position:0%
without you know without anything and
 
01:25:47.229 --> 01:25:47.239 align:start position:0%
the cycle just continues over again um
 
01:25:50.709 --> 01:25:50.719 align:start position:0%
so I I do think that um again to the
 
01:25:52.430 --> 01:25:52.440 align:start position:0%
extent that we want to address these
 
01:25:54.709 --> 01:25:54.719 align:start position:0%
issues um creating a long list of
 
01:25:56.550 --> 01:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
offenses where you can't see a bail
 
01:26:00.030 --> 01:26:00.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner um to me is is not um it's
 
01:26:02.189 --> 01:26:02.199 align:start position:0%
not just but you know it's also just
 
01:26:04.390 --> 01:26:04.400 align:start position:0%
logistically um you know very very
 
01:26:05.950 --> 01:26:05.960 align:start position:0%
challenging for the public defender for
 
01:26:18.550 --> 01:26:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:21.189 align:start position:0%
 
system

01:26:21.189 --> 01:26:21.199 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:26:21.199 --> 01:26:27.910 align:start position:0%
system
correct

01:26:27.910 --> 01:26:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:32.470 align:start position:0%
 
that's

01:26:32.470 --> 01:26:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:34.910 --> 01:26:34.920 align:start position:0%
correct and I'm sorry if I can even add
 
01:26:36.910 --> 01:26:36.920 align:start position:0%
I mean sometimes people meet new
 
01:26:39.950 --> 01:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
contacts in jail um and so they you know
 
01:26:42.070 --> 01:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
they meet more folks who are also
 
01:26:43.950 --> 01:26:43.960 align:start position:0%
struggling with substance use disorder
 
01:26:45.750 --> 01:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
and you know those are more people that
 
01:26:48.109 --> 01:26:48.119 align:start position:0%
they get out and use with or you know
 
01:26:49.870 --> 01:26:49.880 align:start position:0%
have connections to get drugs and things
 
01:27:05.430 --> 01:27:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:16.910 --> 01:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:21.109 align:start position:0%
 
particular

01:27:21.109 --> 01:27:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:21.119 --> 01:27:28.669 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:27:28.669 --> 01:27:28.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:28.679 --> 01:27:34.790 align:start position:0%
 
Y

01:27:34.790 --> 01:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:37.950 --> 01:27:37.960 align:start position:0%
correct absolutely and also you know in
 
01:27:39.430 --> 01:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
all kinds of cases but particularly
 
01:27:41.390 --> 01:27:41.400 align:start position:0%
these misdemeanors cases where the
 
01:27:43.149 --> 01:27:43.159 align:start position:0%
victim does not want does not what the
 
01:27:51.109 --> 01:27:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:51.119 --> 01:28:12.910 align:start position:0%
 
either

01:28:12.910 --> 01:28:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:15.070 --> 01:28:15.080 align:start position:0%
trespass things of that
 
01:28:17.750 --> 01:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
nature those are what's really
 
01:28:20.310 --> 01:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
driving how would you suggest that we
 
01:28:22.629 --> 01:28:22.639 align:start position:0%
would deal with that status quo
 
01:28:24.709 --> 01:28:24.719 align:start position:0%
obviously not
 
01:28:27.149 --> 01:28:27.159 align:start position:0%
sure yeah so sure and that's where I
 
01:28:30.590 --> 01:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
come back to you know more more and more
 
01:28:32.709 --> 01:28:32.719 align:start position:0%
robust pre-trial service programs um
 
01:28:35.390 --> 01:28:35.400 align:start position:0%
diversion programs um we do we are lucky
 
01:28:37.910 --> 01:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
to have drug court um and I think across
 
01:28:40.709 --> 01:28:40.719 align:start position:0%
the state right now we employ uh number
 
01:28:42.470 --> 01:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
one there there's several models of drug
 
01:28:45.229 --> 01:28:45.239 align:start position:0%
court so we employ kind of a a post
 
01:28:47.830 --> 01:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
sentencing highrisk High need model um
 
01:28:49.669 --> 01:28:49.679 align:start position:0%
across the state but there are other
 
01:28:52.109 --> 01:28:52.119 align:start position:0%
models there's even pre-trial models for
 
01:28:54.590 --> 01:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
for drug court and then there are um
 
01:28:56.870 --> 01:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
drug courts you can have a low-risk drug
 
01:28:59.070 --> 01:28:59.080 align:start position:0%
court so essentially like a different
 
01:29:01.470 --> 01:29:01.480 align:start position:0%
kind of diversion type of program maybe
 
01:29:04.070 --> 01:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
you still get a conviction but um you
 
01:29:05.470 --> 01:29:05.480 align:start position:0%
know I think that there's a lot of
 
01:29:08.350 --> 01:29:08.360 align:start position:0%
options on the table um for treatment
 
01:29:11.109 --> 01:29:11.119 align:start position:0%
courts um and then you know frankly you
 
01:29:13.109 --> 01:29:13.119 align:start position:0%
know to the extent that Society wants to
 
01:29:14.510 --> 01:29:14.520 align:start position:0%
do something about this you know I
 
01:29:16.229 --> 01:29:16.239 align:start position:0%
haven't I've talked more about substance
 
01:29:18.149 --> 01:29:18.159 align:start position:0%
use disorder but less about mental
 
01:29:20.390 --> 01:29:20.400 align:start position:0%
health issues but that's a huge driver
 
01:29:21.990 --> 01:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
of this as well particularly when you're
 
01:29:23.910 --> 01:29:23.920 align:start position:0%
talking about these sort of trespass
 
01:29:26.390 --> 01:29:26.400 align:start position:0%
types offenses um you know a lot of
 
01:29:28.310 --> 01:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
times those are folks who are are just
 
01:29:32.669 --> 01:29:32.679 align:start position:0%
actively mentally ill um and um you know
 
01:29:34.629 --> 01:29:34.639 align:start position:0%
go back to places because of you know
 
01:29:35.790 --> 01:29:35.800 align:start position:0%
their mental and I'm not talking about
 
01:29:37.390 --> 01:29:37.400 align:start position:0%
victim's homes but you know they they
 
01:29:39.510 --> 01:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
loiter in the same doorway of the same
 
01:29:41.550 --> 01:29:41.560 align:start position:0%
business um every evening and you know
 
01:29:44.629 --> 01:29:44.639 align:start position:0%
those kinds of things um you know the
 
01:29:46.990 --> 01:29:47.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um just really doesn't
 
01:29:48.550 --> 01:29:48.560 align:start position:0%
have much to speak of in the way of
 
01:29:51.430 --> 01:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
mental health treatment um and so if all
 
01:29:53.390 --> 01:29:53.400 align:start position:0%
of any solution is going to cost money
 
01:29:54.830 --> 01:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
and so why not put the money on the
 
01:29:56.990 --> 01:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
things that are actually going to be in
 
01:30:00.189 --> 01:30:00.199 align:start position:0%
effective um and to me that's these you
 
01:30:02.270 --> 01:30:02.280 align:start position:0%
know Court programs but also investment
 
01:30:04.070 --> 01:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
in our mental health system which right
 
01:30:05.709 --> 01:30:05.719 align:start position:0%
now and I'm sure this is not news to
 
01:30:09.470 --> 01:30:09.480 align:start position:0%
anybody you wait for six months just for
 
01:30:11.669 --> 01:30:11.679 align:start position:0%
an initial appointment um for mental
 
01:30:14.470 --> 01:30:14.480 align:start position:0%
health um and for people who are you
 
01:30:16.910 --> 01:30:16.920 align:start position:0%
know actively very symptomatic in the
 
01:30:19.550 --> 01:30:19.560 align:start position:0%
more you know Ser more severe mental
 
01:30:22.030 --> 01:30:22.040 align:start position:0%
health issues there's just you know even
 
01:30:23.990 --> 01:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
that person is says fine I you know I
 
01:30:26.709 --> 01:30:26.719 align:start position:0%
want to go to the hospital please um
 
01:30:29.070 --> 01:30:29.080 align:start position:0%
there's nowhere for them to go um so
 
01:30:31.390 --> 01:30:31.400 align:start position:0%
that's where we need to be investing the
 
01:30:33.669 --> 01:30:33.679 align:start position:0%
money I I think the challenge for the
 
01:30:36.550 --> 01:30:36.560 align:start position:0%
committee is that um even if we had a
 
01:30:38.950 --> 01:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
magic wand and said okay we are going to
 
01:30:41.149 --> 01:30:41.159 align:start position:0%
create a 500 bed mental health facility
 
01:30:43.030 --> 01:30:43.040 align:start position:0%
it would take 10 years to get built sure
 
01:30:46.109 --> 01:30:46.119 align:start position:0%
so we need more Immediate Solutions um
 
01:30:48.550 --> 01:30:48.560 align:start position:0%
to to help deal with it the pre-trial
 
01:30:51.950 --> 01:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
sounds um a good way to start what what
 
01:30:53.590 --> 01:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
do the pre-trial programs that you're
 
01:30:56.030 --> 01:30:56.040 align:start position:0%
aware of that you are aware of how are
 
01:30:57.430 --> 01:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
they dealing with mental health
 
01:30:59.629 --> 01:30:59.639 align:start position:0%
challenged individuals like that that
 
01:31:01.709 --> 01:31:01.719 align:start position:0%
are committing these these for lack of a
 
01:31:03.510 --> 01:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
better term nuisance crimes that are
 
01:31:04.830 --> 01:31:04.840 align:start position:0%
making the paper every day that are
 
01:31:07.910 --> 01:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
causing people to complain so I I think
 
01:31:10.229 --> 01:31:10.239 align:start position:0%
one thing one and and it might sound
 
01:31:12.109 --> 01:31:12.119 align:start position:0%
minor but it is not but that they offer
 
01:31:14.950 --> 01:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
is case management is somebody who is
 
01:31:18.229 --> 01:31:18.239 align:start position:0%
actively working with that individual um
 
01:31:19.950 --> 01:31:19.960 align:start position:0%
who's having contact with that
 
01:31:22.109 --> 01:31:22.119 align:start position:0%
individual um and I can tell you
 
01:31:24.470 --> 01:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
anecdotally but also I've seen research
 
01:31:26.350 --> 01:31:26.360 align:start position:0%
you know just having one person in your
 
01:31:29.030 --> 01:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
life who you know checks in on you and
 
01:31:31.310 --> 01:31:31.320 align:start position:0%
reminds you about your appointments and
 
01:31:32.709 --> 01:31:32.719 align:start position:0%
you know reminds you about your
 
01:31:36.109 --> 01:31:36.119 align:start position:0%
medications um and cares about you um
 
01:31:37.910 --> 01:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
that can make all the difference so it's
 
01:31:41.189 --> 01:31:41.199 align:start position:0%
access to case management um it's also
 
01:31:42.990 --> 01:31:43.000 align:start position:0%
you know you can wait and certainly
 
01:31:44.870 --> 01:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
pre-trial services does not make Mental
 
01:31:46.350 --> 01:31:46.360 align:start position:0%
Health appointments you know fall out of
 
01:31:49.070 --> 01:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
the sky um but there are options that a
 
01:31:51.030 --> 01:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
lot of clients either don't know about
 
01:31:53.590 --> 01:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
or have bu barriers to accessing in
 
01:31:55.229 --> 01:31:55.239 align:start position:0%
terms of emergency appointments for
 
01:31:57.629 --> 01:31:57.639 align:start position:0%
medication um so it is possible even if
 
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
you have to wait for therapy um you know
 
01:32:02.910 --> 01:32:02.920 align:start position:0%
long term um there are ways to get
 
01:32:04.790 --> 01:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
access to medication on an on an
 
01:32:07.390 --> 01:32:07.400 align:start position:0%
emergency basis that clients you know
 
01:32:09.910 --> 01:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
either don't know about or you know have
 
01:32:13.149 --> 01:32:13.159 align:start position:0%
trouble with the follow through um and
 
01:32:15.030 --> 01:32:15.040 align:start position:0%
um again with the case management that
 
01:32:17.070 --> 01:32:17.080 align:start position:0%
that can provide and and you know
 
01:32:19.189 --> 01:32:19.199 align:start position:0%
frankly the the consequences that comes
 
01:32:21.109 --> 01:32:21.119 align:start position:0%
with you know pre-trial Services also
 
01:32:22.750 --> 01:32:22.760 align:start position:0%
you know that's part of the model is
 
01:32:24.750 --> 01:32:24.760 align:start position:0%
that if you're not abiding by these
 
01:32:27.629 --> 01:32:27.639 align:start position:0%
conditions there are consequences um so
 
01:32:29.430 --> 01:32:29.440 align:start position:0%
that's how those types of programs can
 
01:32:32.790 --> 01:32:32.800 align:start position:0%
help um as far as you're aware do most
 
01:32:36.510 --> 01:32:36.520 align:start position:0%
of your um clients have cell
 
01:32:40.030 --> 01:32:40.040 align:start position:0%
phones oh yes some of them have um you
 
01:32:41.669 --> 01:32:41.679 align:start position:0%
know some of them don't but I I would
 
01:32:43.790 --> 01:32:43.800 align:start position:0%
say most of them do some of them you
 
01:32:46.149 --> 01:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
know work only on Wi-Fi um but they're
 
01:32:48.350 --> 01:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
Adept at you know making that work for
 
01:32:51.870 --> 01:32:51.880 align:start position:0%
them y so we've heard testimony of other
 
01:32:53.310 --> 01:32:53.320 align:start position:0%
states where they have these text
 
01:32:55.109 --> 01:32:55.119 align:start position:0%
message programs where the court
 
01:32:57.830 --> 01:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
implements you um we're already doing
 
01:33:00.270 --> 01:33:00.280 align:start position:0%
that oh the Public Public fenders off
 
01:33:02.149 --> 01:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
that yes have you found that to help
 
01:33:04.109 --> 01:33:04.119 align:start position:0%
getting people to court on time and not
 
01:33:06.629 --> 01:33:06.639 align:start position:0%
missing getting these repeated defaults
 
01:33:08.510 --> 01:33:08.520 align:start position:0%
yes I you know we just started it we
 
01:33:10.470 --> 01:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
rolled it out I think at the early
 
01:33:15.070 --> 01:33:15.080 align:start position:0%
summer um and um they they yes it
 
01:33:16.870 --> 01:33:16.880 align:start position:0%
anecdotal I I don't have data in front
 
01:33:20.149 --> 01:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
of me but anecdotally I think yes it is
 
01:33:22.629 --> 01:33:22.639 align:start position:0%
helping and that's run by your office so
 
01:33:24.790 --> 01:33:24.800 align:start position:0%
when you represent 85% of the criminal
 
01:33:26.790 --> 01:33:26.800 align:start position:0%
defendants in the state so at least 85%
 
01:33:29.590 --> 01:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
of the defendants perhaps 83 the other
 
01:33:31.390 --> 01:33:31.400 align:start position:0%
two don't have phones but are getting a
 
01:33:32.629 --> 01:33:32.639 align:start position:0%
text message when do you send the
 
01:33:35.990 --> 01:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
message so I I believe it goes out two
 
01:33:38.870 --> 01:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
days before um but I can get back to you
 
01:33:40.950 --> 01:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
with that exact answer it's that's that
 
01:33:44.750 --> 01:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
one message two days before yes it I'm
 
01:33:46.310 --> 01:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
sorry that I should know this it might
 
01:33:48.470 --> 01:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
be one two day two days before and one
 
01:33:50.390 --> 01:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
the day of I I can it an automated
 
01:33:53.189 --> 01:33:53.199 align:start position:0%
system yes and you can't reply to it
 
01:33:55.109 --> 01:33:55.119 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah well no it might be good if
 
01:33:57.070 --> 01:33:57.080 align:start position:0%
you set it up to do the morning of the
 
01:34:00.950 --> 01:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
night before um maybe the hour right um
 
01:34:03.950 --> 01:34:03.960 align:start position:0%
I can I and it might even be this the
 
01:34:06.270 --> 01:34:06.280 align:start position:0%
two days before and and the day of but I
 
01:34:08.189 --> 01:34:08.199 align:start position:0%
I can I can get back to you about that
 
01:34:11.189 --> 01:34:11.199 align:start position:0%
um with regard to clients getting to
 
01:34:14.790 --> 01:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
actual the court um the vast majority
 
01:34:17.310 --> 01:34:17.320 align:start position:0%
don't have cars is my
 
01:34:19.950 --> 01:34:19.960 align:start position:0%
understanding how do your clients find a
 
01:34:21.629 --> 01:34:21.639 align:start position:0%
way to get I know a lot of we went went
 
01:34:23.310 --> 01:34:23.320 align:start position:0%
to court um at the beginning of the
 
01:34:26.350 --> 01:34:26.360 align:start position:0%
session to observe a a Monday morning uh
 
01:34:28.790 --> 01:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
hearing at the circuit court and we saw
 
01:34:31.790 --> 01:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of defaults and um I'm assuming a
 
01:34:32.910 --> 01:34:32.920 align:start position:0%
lot of that people just didn't have
 
01:34:35.470 --> 01:34:35.480 align:start position:0%
rides or they didn't arrange for rides
 
01:34:36.590 --> 01:34:36.600 align:start position:0%
they don't some of them don't know where
 
01:34:38.550 --> 01:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
their next meal's coming from so right
 
01:34:41.550 --> 01:34:41.560 align:start position:0%
how how how could how do you assist if
 
01:34:44.070 --> 01:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
you do your clients getting there short
 
01:34:45.470 --> 01:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
of actually I know you don't pick them
 
01:34:47.470 --> 01:34:47.480 align:start position:0%
up yeah we're we're we're not allowed to
 
01:34:50.950 --> 01:34:50.960 align:start position:0%
do that um for liability issues but um
 
01:34:53.550 --> 01:34:53.560 align:start position:0%
we so you know in certain places
 
01:34:55.590 --> 01:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
obviously you know the the courts are
 
01:34:58.510 --> 01:34:58.520 align:start position:0%
not far from you know like in Manchester
 
01:35:00.030 --> 01:35:00.040 align:start position:0%
you know the court is easy to access but
 
01:35:01.270 --> 01:35:01.280 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of places throughout the
 
01:35:03.750 --> 01:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
state where it's it's not as easy um so
 
01:35:05.830 --> 01:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of that is again comes back to you
 
01:35:07.229 --> 01:35:07.239 align:start position:0%
know the attorney as kind of case
 
01:35:08.990 --> 01:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
manager in that instance like calling
 
01:35:11.350 --> 01:35:11.360 align:start position:0%
the client being like what is your plan
 
01:35:12.910 --> 01:35:12.920 align:start position:0%
okay well do you have a friend do you
 
01:35:14.350 --> 01:35:14.360 align:start position:0%
have a family member okay you don't
 
01:35:16.709 --> 01:35:16.719 align:start position:0%
let's let's look at the bus schedule or
 
01:35:18.830 --> 01:35:18.840 align:start position:0%
you know we have clients and it's very
 
01:35:21.070 --> 01:35:21.080 align:start position:0%
very frequent who walk and who walk huge
 
01:35:25.229 --> 01:35:25.239 align:start position:0%
dist es um but I think a lot of it is um
 
01:35:27.590 --> 01:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
about providing that support um because
 
01:35:29.030 --> 01:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
if they just don't have a car or a lot
 
01:35:30.070 --> 01:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
of times it's that they don't have a
 
01:35:31.750 --> 01:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
license um so they're not allowed to
 
01:35:34.590 --> 01:35:34.600 align:start position:0%
drive um is doing that troubleshooting
 
01:35:36.750 --> 01:35:36.760 align:start position:0%
with your client ahead of time um and
 
01:35:38.430 --> 01:35:38.440 align:start position:0%
again that's where pre-trial Services
 
01:35:40.510 --> 01:35:40.520 align:start position:0%
can step in where we can't we don't have
 
01:35:43.750 --> 01:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
the capacity to do that um you know for
 
01:35:46.070 --> 01:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
every client every time um pre-trial
 
01:35:49.070 --> 01:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
services or um other Solutions but you
 
01:35:51.149 --> 01:35:51.159 align:start position:0%
know there are a lot of defaults but you
 
01:35:53.350 --> 01:35:53.360 align:start position:0%
know I got to say you know clients by
 
01:35:55.669 --> 01:35:55.679 align:start position:0%
and large come to court um you know they
 
01:35:58.189 --> 01:35:58.199 align:start position:0%
make it work yeah they they understand
 
01:35:59.830 --> 01:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
that that's they have to they have to
 
01:36:01.510 --> 01:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
figure it out I have to get a ride I
 
01:36:06.030 --> 01:36:06.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:09.790 --> 01:36:09.800 align:start position:0%
um okay questions from the
 
01:36:11.790 --> 01:36:11.800 align:start position:0%
committee sure representative Katherine
 
01:36:14.270 --> 01:36:14.280 align:start position:0%
here Katherine thank you Mr chair thank
 
01:36:16.910 --> 01:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um you
 
01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:18.109 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um you
mentioned

01:36:18.109 --> 01:36:18.119 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
01:36:22.109 --> 01:36:22.119 align:start position:0%
that there's um the text message Jean do
 
01:36:24.590 --> 01:36:24.600 align:start position:0%
you have any data on how well your
 
01:36:26.950 --> 01:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
office is doing with that I don't right
 
01:36:29.430 --> 01:36:29.440 align:start position:0%
now no but is it something that you
 
01:36:32.229 --> 01:36:32.239 align:start position:0%
could get I I can't we don't track data
 
01:36:34.950 --> 01:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
of when I mean we don't track data of
 
01:36:36.950 --> 01:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
when clients come to court I guess I I
 
01:36:40.030 --> 01:36:40.040 align:start position:0%
have the ability I think if we close the
 
01:36:43.350 --> 01:36:43.360 align:start position:0%
case for a warrant I have that we can
 
01:36:45.350 --> 01:36:45.360 align:start position:0%
run a report that shows cases that are
 
01:36:48.629 --> 01:36:48.639 align:start position:0%
closed with warrants um so I could
 
01:36:51.669 --> 01:36:51.679 align:start position:0%
potentially run reports to see if cases
 
01:36:54.629 --> 01:36:54.639 align:start position:0%
are being how that stat has looked now
 
01:36:56.350 --> 01:36:56.360 align:start position:0%
that compared to before we had text
 
01:36:59.229 --> 01:36:59.239 align:start position:0%
messaging I think I could okay that
 
01:37:01.310 --> 01:37:01.320 align:start position:0%
would be good to okay thank you what's
 
01:37:03.350 --> 01:37:03.360 align:start position:0%
the average case load of of your
 
01:37:05.750 --> 01:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
attorneys right now so you know by
 
01:37:07.310 --> 01:37:07.320 align:start position:0%
contract case loads are supposed to be
 
01:37:11.510 --> 01:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
around 70 um right now um right right
 
01:37:13.910 --> 01:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
now they're um it depends on different
 
01:37:16.189 --> 01:37:16.199 align:start position:0%
pockets of the state some but anyway but
 
01:37:18.070 --> 01:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
85 95
 
01:37:22.669 --> 01:37:22.679 align:start position:0%
105 cases active ongoing at a time yes
 
01:37:26.430 --> 01:37:26.440 align:start position:0%
so 75 to 105 depending
 
01:37:28.550 --> 01:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
Y and what are your prospects for
 
01:37:31.189 --> 01:37:31.199 align:start position:0%
getting new attorneys by
 
01:37:34.950 --> 01:37:34.960 align:start position:0%
January um we did just um we started so
 
01:37:37.629 --> 01:37:37.639 align:start position:0%
we started a new class of lawyers um you
 
01:37:39.629 --> 01:37:39.639 align:start position:0%
typically not all but typically brand
 
01:37:41.629 --> 01:37:41.639 align:start position:0%
new lawyers um and they started in
 
01:37:45.629 --> 01:37:45.639 align:start position:0%
August um so we have um you know a a a
 
01:37:47.830 --> 01:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
group of lawyers that just started but
 
01:37:49.669 --> 01:37:49.679 align:start position:0%
we were hoping you know as we always
 
01:37:52.470 --> 01:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
hope that that in increases our numbers
 
01:37:55.550 --> 01:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
um but as attrition continues it it just
 
01:37:57.629 --> 01:37:57.639 align:start position:0%
barely or not even keeps us at break
 
01:38:01.950 --> 01:38:01.960 align:start position:0%
even um we are um you know advertising
 
01:38:03.870 --> 01:38:03.880 align:start position:0%
you know Statewide but also nationally
 
01:38:05.709 --> 01:38:05.719 align:start position:0%
for lateral attorneys so those are
 
01:38:08.470 --> 01:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
attorneys with prior experience um we
 
01:38:11.430 --> 01:38:11.440 align:start position:0%
have we have um a Federal grant um that
 
01:38:13.270 --> 01:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
actually I don't know that we could use
 
01:38:15.550 --> 01:38:15.560 align:start position:0%
that for new hires but we are covering
 
01:38:17.790 --> 01:38:17.800 align:start position:0%
some of our current lateral hires um the
 
01:38:20.270 --> 01:38:20.280 align:start position:0%
judicial Council um you know helped us
 
01:38:22.830 --> 01:38:22.840 align:start position:0%
obtain that Grant that's been wonderful
 
01:38:26.550 --> 01:38:26.560 align:start position:0%
um we are um right now um we have a
 
01:38:28.070 --> 01:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
committee you know we are looking at
 
01:38:29.950 --> 01:38:29.960 align:start position:0%
ways to actually be even more aggressive
 
01:38:33.270 --> 01:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
in our recruiting um we we have a lot of
 
01:38:35.270 --> 01:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
success in in recruiting law school
 
01:38:38.310 --> 01:38:38.320 align:start position:0%
graduates um but um you know with the
 
01:38:39.550 --> 01:38:39.560 align:start position:0%
experience that you've heard about you
 
01:38:41.070 --> 01:38:41.080 align:start position:0%
know the experience that's walked out at
 
01:38:43.750 --> 01:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
the door over the last three or four
 
01:38:45.790 --> 01:38:45.800 align:start position:0%
years um you know new attorneys are
 
01:38:47.990 --> 01:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
wonderful but um you know we we need to
 
01:38:49.870 --> 01:38:49.880 align:start position:0%
replace some of that experience and so
 
01:38:52.629 --> 01:38:52.639 align:start position:0%
we are looking um at strategies to be
 
01:38:55.550 --> 01:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
even more aggressive with um with hiring
 
01:38:57.229 --> 01:38:57.239 align:start position:0%
lateral attorneys yeah I think the
 
01:38:59.310 --> 01:38:59.320 align:start position:0%
corporate work calls that brain drain
 
01:39:02.709 --> 01:39:02.719 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah um is there any programs in
 
01:39:05.510 --> 01:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
place that attract students that may or
 
01:39:07.510 --> 01:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
even some people with experience because
 
01:39:09.030 --> 01:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
I know a lot of attorneys carry student
 
01:39:11.510 --> 01:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
loan debt for a number of years to help
 
01:39:14.669 --> 01:39:14.679 align:start position:0%
offset some of their debt so yes there
 
01:39:16.750 --> 01:39:16.760 align:start position:0%
are there's a there has been for a very
 
01:39:18.629 --> 01:39:18.639 align:start position:0%
long time a federal program where if you
 
01:39:20.430 --> 01:39:20.440 align:start position:0%
work as a public defender or a
 
01:39:22.790 --> 01:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
prosecutor for 10 years um you can get
 
01:39:25.390 --> 01:39:25.400 align:start position:0%
loan forgiveness um but you know 10
 
01:39:28.430 --> 01:39:28.440 align:start position:0%
years is a long time um and you know
 
01:39:30.030 --> 01:39:30.040 align:start position:0%
there's more money in the private sector
 
01:39:33.189 --> 01:39:33.199 align:start position:0%
so some people on balance would rather
 
01:39:34.950 --> 01:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
go to the private sector and and give up
 
01:39:37.310 --> 01:39:37.320 align:start position:0%
on the loan forgiveness um I know that
 
01:39:39.990 --> 01:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
obviously there's been a lot of effort
 
01:39:43.070 --> 01:39:43.080 align:start position:0%
um to to increase loan forgiveness um
 
01:39:44.790 --> 01:39:44.800 align:start position:0%
and that would be
 
01:39:47.950 --> 01:39:47.960 align:start position:0%
wonderful um I know that and this is
 
01:39:50.109 --> 01:39:50.119 align:start position:0%
just off topic but some I don't know if
 
01:39:52.750 --> 01:39:52.760 align:start position:0%
you thought about it but but uh a lot of
 
01:39:55.910 --> 01:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
um attorneys leaving the Jag Corp are
 
01:39:57.229 --> 01:39:57.239 align:start position:0%
looking for jobs I don't know if you
 
01:39:59.950 --> 01:39:59.960 align:start position:0%
recruit with the military or not but um
 
01:40:01.990 --> 01:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of people decided you know
 
01:40:03.669 --> 01:40:03.679 align:start position:0%
I don't want to go defend people in
 
01:40:05.709 --> 01:40:05.719 align:start position:0%
Afghanistan I think I'll come home and
 
01:40:09.350 --> 01:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
right so just a thought question uh from
 
01:40:11.430 --> 01:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
the committee representative roach thank
 
01:40:13.550 --> 01:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman I'm just trying to get
 
01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:14.950 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman I'm just trying to get
some

01:40:14.950 --> 01:40:14.960 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:40:16.950 --> 01:40:16.960 align:start position:0%
clarity because we've heard from pretty
 
01:40:18.550 --> 01:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
much every single person that has
 
01:40:21.229 --> 01:40:21.239 align:start position:0%
testified which we have also learned
 
01:40:23.589 --> 01:40:23.599 align:start position:0%
that there there is not a mechanism in
 
01:40:25.910 --> 01:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to to track who is on bail
 
01:40:28.950 --> 01:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
or who is not on bail so with that being
 
01:40:31.430 --> 01:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
said and then if if I heard correctly
 
01:40:33.790 --> 01:40:33.800 align:start position:0%
you had said that you don't have a lot
 
01:40:36.589 --> 01:40:36.599 align:start position:0%
of people that are repeating because
 
01:40:38.629 --> 01:40:38.639 align:start position:0%
repeating like breaking their bail
 
01:40:41.430 --> 01:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
conditions so I'm a little bit confused
 
01:40:45.229 --> 01:40:45.239 align:start position:0%
on on how that comes about sure so I I
 
01:40:47.229 --> 01:40:47.239 align:start position:0%
mean when you look at what percentage of
 
01:40:50.629 --> 01:40:50.639 align:start position:0%
folks you know that we see that um you
 
01:40:53.470 --> 01:40:53.480 align:start position:0%
know pick up new charges while they're
 
01:40:55.629 --> 01:40:55.639 align:start position:0%
out on bail certainly it's higher than
 
01:40:57.070 --> 01:40:57.080 align:start position:0%
than I understand that the community
 
01:40:58.870 --> 01:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
wants it to be but as a percentage of
 
01:41:00.950 --> 01:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
the whole it's not as if you know
 
01:41:04.589 --> 01:41:04.599 align:start position:0%
there's 80 you know 70 even 60% of folks
 
01:41:06.189 --> 01:41:06.199 align:start position:0%
who are who are committing new offenses
 
01:41:07.709 --> 01:41:07.719 align:start position:0%
while they're out on bail but I think
 
01:41:10.149 --> 01:41:10.159 align:start position:0%
also my my bigger point in that regard
 
01:41:12.990 --> 01:41:13.000 align:start position:0%
is that I haven't seen you know a spike
 
01:41:14.629 --> 01:41:14.639 align:start position:0%
in this occurring you know that this is
 
01:41:17.070 --> 01:41:17.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunately a constant that I've seen
 
01:41:18.750 --> 01:41:18.760 align:start position:0%
from the beginning of my career that
 
01:41:20.189 --> 01:41:20.199 align:start position:0%
that folks who struggle with mental
 
01:41:22.270 --> 01:41:22.280 align:start position:0%
health disorders and substance use
 
01:41:24.149 --> 01:41:24.159 align:start position:0%
disorders and struggle with homelessness
 
01:41:27.149 --> 01:41:27.159 align:start position:0%
are going to have issues um with you
 
01:41:29.510 --> 01:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
know picking up new offenses um and to
 
01:41:32.070 --> 01:41:32.080 align:start position:0%
me I haven't seen that necessarily
 
01:41:34.750 --> 01:41:34.760 align:start position:0%
change um very much that there's always
 
01:41:37.070 --> 01:41:37.080 align:start position:0%
people there's always been people who
 
01:41:38.870 --> 01:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
are have mental health and substance use
 
01:41:41.750 --> 01:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
issues um and struggle with coming to
 
01:41:44.390 --> 01:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
court or struggle with you know still
 
01:41:47.470 --> 01:41:47.480 align:start position:0%
still using drugs um or still you know
 
01:41:49.870 --> 01:41:49.880 align:start position:0%
committing um you know thefts to support
 
01:41:52.350 --> 01:41:52.360 align:start position:0%
drug habits um but that to me is not I
 
01:41:54.589 --> 01:41:54.599 align:start position:0%
haven't seen changes to that that that's
 
01:41:57.229 --> 01:41:57.239 align:start position:0%
been pretty
 
01:42:01.270 --> 01:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
consistent um what well you I think you
 
01:42:03.189 --> 01:42:03.199 align:start position:0%
would probably agree though that the as
 
01:42:04.950 --> 01:42:04.960 align:start position:0%
a percentage of the whole they're not
 
01:42:07.629 --> 01:42:07.639 align:start position:0%
increasing but the number of people that
 
01:42:10.430 --> 01:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
are in the system is increasing um I
 
01:42:12.350 --> 01:42:12.360 align:start position:0%
mean it has to be with the opioid crisis
 
01:42:13.709 --> 01:42:13.719 align:start position:0%
you have more people that are substance
 
01:42:15.790 --> 01:42:15.800 align:start position:0%
addicted now than ever before with the
 
01:42:19.310 --> 01:42:19.320 align:start position:0%
mental health is is spiked huge um so
 
01:42:21.310 --> 01:42:21.320 align:start position:0%
that has to be driving a a larger
 
01:42:23.030 --> 01:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
increase in the sheer number of people
 
01:42:25.669 --> 01:42:25.679 align:start position:0%
who are in the system versus perhaps 15
 
01:42:25.679 --> 01:42:26.629 align:start position:0%
who are in the system versus perhaps 15
years

01:42:26.629 --> 01:42:26.639 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:42:29.870 --> 01:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
ago I mean I I think actually if you
 
01:42:31.589 --> 01:42:31.599 align:start position:0%
looked at the number of criminal cases
 
01:42:33.589 --> 01:42:33.599 align:start position:0%
that are opened not just by my office
 
01:42:34.870 --> 01:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
but that are handled by the courts the
 
01:42:36.830 --> 01:42:36.840 align:start position:0%
number is actually decreased every year
 
01:42:42.350 --> 01:42:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:44.430 --> 01:42:44.440 align:start position:0%
years so what do you think is striving
 
01:42:46.709 --> 01:42:46.719 align:start position:0%
the public um the public is it a
 
01:42:48.430 --> 01:42:48.440 align:start position:0%
combination of the homelessness the
 
01:42:51.030 --> 01:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
drugs I think it's I will say I think it
 
01:42:52.709 --> 01:42:52.719 align:start position:0%
is more visible you know I think you
 
01:42:54.709 --> 01:42:54.719 align:start position:0%
know if you walk downtown Manchester
 
01:42:56.430 --> 01:42:56.440 align:start position:0%
it's it's visible right there's there's
 
01:42:58.149 --> 01:42:58.159 align:start position:0%
homeless there's homeless people there
 
01:43:00.390 --> 01:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
you know it's more visible than it was
 
01:43:02.589 --> 01:43:02.599 align:start position:0%
um you know years ago and years past and
 
01:43:04.790 --> 01:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
I I'm not trying to say there certainly
 
01:43:07.430 --> 01:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
has been there is you know an opioid
 
01:43:09.270 --> 01:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
epidemic in New Hampshire there are a
 
01:43:11.470 --> 01:43:11.480 align:start position:0%
lot of ill people people are sicker than
 
01:43:13.270 --> 01:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
they were when I started this job more
 
01:43:15.229 --> 01:43:15.239 align:start position:0%
people are more sick than when I started
 
01:43:16.950 --> 01:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
this job I I certainly do agree with
 
01:43:20.910 --> 01:43:20.920 align:start position:0%
that um and um but I I I don't
 
01:43:23.070 --> 01:43:23.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily think that you know these
 
01:43:24.510 --> 01:43:24.520 align:start position:0%
issues are are
 
01:43:28.390 --> 01:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
new thank you further questions from the
 
01:43:30.790 --> 01:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
committee represent Pratt he answer most
 
01:43:34.270 --> 01:43:34.280 align:start position:0%
of my question but I but uh I everything
 
01:43:36.310 --> 01:43:36.320 align:start position:0%
you did good yeah I have one question
 
01:43:39.350 --> 01:43:39.360 align:start position:0%
for you um isn't the attorney shortage
 
01:43:41.109 --> 01:43:41.119 align:start position:0%
an ongoing thing with the defendant's
 
01:43:43.470 --> 01:43:43.480 align:start position:0%
office isn't I mean doesn't people come
 
01:43:45.790 --> 01:43:45.800 align:start position:0%
in they do the job and they stay not
 
01:43:48.270 --> 01:43:48.280 align:start position:0%
don't stay forever they leave and go on
 
01:43:51.229 --> 01:43:51.239 align:start position:0%
is that way it's always been so no I
 
01:43:53.669 --> 01:43:53.679 align:start position:0%
mean yes and no um so yes there's this
 
01:43:55.750 --> 01:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
is always can be you know a starting
 
01:43:57.830 --> 01:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
point for people in their career um so
 
01:44:00.910 --> 01:44:00.920 align:start position:0%
that yes that that is true um but this
 
01:44:02.669 --> 01:44:02.679 align:start position:0%
has also always been a place where
 
01:44:05.310 --> 01:44:05.320 align:start position:0%
people come and spend their career um
 
01:44:06.950 --> 01:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
and you know that this is you know what
 
01:44:09.790 --> 01:44:09.800 align:start position:0%
they want to do um and you know we have
 
01:44:11.830 --> 01:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
I think I just looked at it not too long
 
01:44:15.390 --> 01:44:15.400 align:start position:0%
ago um something like 30% of our staff
 
01:44:20.109 --> 01:44:20.119 align:start position:0%
lawyers have been with us um for um for
 
01:44:22.550 --> 01:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
12 years or more um so we do have people
 
01:44:24.510 --> 01:44:24.520 align:start position:0%
who make a career of this and those are
 
01:44:26.510 --> 01:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
some of the people that we were losing
 
01:44:27.870 --> 01:44:27.880 align:start position:0%
but just kind of across the board the
 
01:44:31.310 --> 01:44:31.320 align:start position:0%
reason I say um you know that it that it
 
01:44:34.109 --> 01:44:34.119 align:start position:0%
is different is because um starting
 
01:44:36.669 --> 01:44:36.679 align:start position:0%
actually a little bit before the coid
 
01:44:38.310 --> 01:44:38.320 align:start position:0%
pandemic um but certainly during the
 
01:44:41.189 --> 01:44:41.199 align:start position:0%
coid pandemic and since then um you know
 
01:44:43.270 --> 01:44:43.280 align:start position:0%
just attrition has has truly spiked we
 
01:44:45.229 --> 01:44:45.239 align:start position:0%
have not seen quite these levels of
 
01:44:47.669 --> 01:44:47.679 align:start position:0%
attrition um that we're seeing now um
 
01:44:51.669 --> 01:44:51.679 align:start position:0%
just I can tell you um for example in
 
01:44:53.109 --> 01:44:53.119 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
01:44:55.550 --> 01:44:55.560 align:start position:0%
2018 um you know seven attorneys
 
01:44:57.709 --> 01:44:57.719 align:start position:0%
Departed the public defender and then in
 
01:45:01.350 --> 01:45:01.360 align:start position:0%
fiscal year um 23 22 attorneys Departed
 
01:45:05.189 --> 01:45:05.199 align:start position:0%
the the the public defender so thank you
 
01:45:07.390 --> 01:45:07.400 align:start position:0%
so would you attribute that more to just
 
01:45:09.950 --> 01:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
burnout because of the case load I think
 
01:45:12.629 --> 01:45:12.639 align:start position:0%
burnout and and pay I know that many
 
01:45:15.149 --> 01:45:15.159 align:start position:0%
attorneys um will go to the public
 
01:45:17.790 --> 01:45:17.800 align:start position:0%
defender or the prosecutor's office
 
01:45:20.070 --> 01:45:20.080 align:start position:0%
because firms are always looking for
 
01:45:22.430 --> 01:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
people with trial experience and that's
 
01:45:24.830 --> 01:45:24.840 align:start position:0%
where you get trial experience um so
 
01:45:26.910 --> 01:45:26.920 align:start position:0%
they'll stay a few years to get that and
 
01:45:28.990 --> 01:45:29.000 align:start position:0%
then they'll go but you to your what you
 
01:45:30.510 --> 01:45:30.520 align:start position:0%
said earlier there is a percentage who
 
01:45:32.229 --> 01:45:32.239 align:start position:0%
just want to be public defenders or just
 
01:45:35.189 --> 01:45:35.199 align:start position:0%
want to be prosecutors yes what is the
 
01:45:38.229 --> 01:45:38.239 align:start position:0%
the pay parody If or what between a
 
01:45:40.669 --> 01:45:40.679 align:start position:0%
prosecutor and a starting attorney in
 
01:45:44.189 --> 01:45:44.199 align:start position:0%
your office yep so um and we have looked
 
01:45:47.629 --> 01:45:47.639 align:start position:0%
at that we um you know we were um we
 
01:45:49.629 --> 01:45:49.639 align:start position:0%
were able to do so during the pandemic
 
01:45:52.189 --> 01:45:52.199 align:start position:0%
we applied for for um I wasn't in my
 
01:45:54.790 --> 01:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
role at that time but um we applied for
 
01:45:57.109 --> 01:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
sort of emergency funds to do a cost of
 
01:45:59.030 --> 01:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
living increase um and so we were able
 
01:46:02.229 --> 01:46:02.239 align:start position:0%
to do that um the budget that we just
 
01:46:04.990 --> 01:46:05.000 align:start position:0%
received um in for July 1 allowed us
 
01:46:07.470 --> 01:46:07.480 align:start position:0%
just just to continue that to make that
 
01:46:09.990 --> 01:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
permanent um and also allowed us to do a
 
01:46:12.950 --> 01:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
further uh pay increase um so we have
 
01:46:14.950 --> 01:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
been able to increase pay over the last
 
01:46:16.030 --> 01:46:16.040 align:start position:0%
you know since
 
01:46:19.830 --> 01:46:19.840 align:start position:0%
2022 um you in terms of parity um we are
 
01:46:23.109 --> 01:46:23.119 align:start position:0%
still generally you know um we are now
 
01:46:25.589 --> 01:46:25.599 align:start position:0%
more on par than we were before um but
 
01:46:27.910 --> 01:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
there's still certainly um depending on
 
01:46:30.390 --> 01:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
which county we look at County attorneys
 
01:46:33.990 --> 01:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
um salary and actually um you know City
 
01:46:36.189 --> 01:46:36.199 align:start position:0%
prosecutors actually a lot of times um
 
01:46:37.790 --> 01:46:37.800 align:start position:0%
make more money than both public
 
01:46:39.870 --> 01:46:39.880 align:start position:0%
defenders and County attorneys um which
 
01:46:41.750 --> 01:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
is interesting because they're largely
 
01:46:42.990 --> 01:46:43.000 align:start position:0%
Prosecuting or they're Prosecuting
 
01:46:45.669 --> 01:46:45.679 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor and violation level offenses
 
01:46:49.709 --> 01:46:49.719 align:start position:0%
um so our pay period parody has gotten
 
01:46:53.189 --> 01:46:53.199 align:start position:0%
better um um but um particularly on on
 
01:46:55.350 --> 01:46:55.360 align:start position:0%
for our starting steps um there's a
 
01:46:58.390 --> 01:46:58.400 align:start position:0%
there's more work to be done do does the
 
01:46:59.950 --> 01:46:59.960 align:start position:0%
prosecutor's office to that you know
 
01:47:02.070 --> 01:47:02.080 align:start position:0%
have suffered from the same um levels of
 
01:47:04.189 --> 01:47:04.199 align:start position:0%
attrition or inability to attract new
 
01:47:07.589 --> 01:47:07.599 align:start position:0%
attorneys that you do yes so they're
 
01:47:10.589 --> 01:47:10.599 align:start position:0%
short as well I yes and their case loads
 
01:47:12.589 --> 01:47:12.599 align:start position:0%
are probably similar they have to be I
 
01:47:15.350 --> 01:47:15.360 align:start position:0%
would assume yes okay thank you or they
 
01:47:18.830 --> 01:47:18.840 align:start position:0%
they might even be higher than ours um
 
01:47:21.470 --> 01:47:21.480 align:start position:0%
um because they I'm not to at all
 
01:47:22.790 --> 01:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
minimize their work but you know they
 
01:47:24.589 --> 01:47:24.599 align:start position:0%
don't have the individual clients that I
 
01:47:26.830 --> 01:47:26.840 align:start position:0%
do so I I think that just the raw number
 
01:47:29.149 --> 01:47:29.159 align:start position:0%
might actually be higher than ours okay
 
01:47:31.390 --> 01:47:31.400 align:start position:0%
thank you um any further questions oh
 
01:47:35.070 --> 01:47:35.080 align:start position:0%
represent way thank you Mr chairman um
 
01:47:39.070 --> 01:47:39.080 align:start position:0%
so say we were able to pass this list of
 
01:47:42.109 --> 01:47:42.119 align:start position:0%
uh crimes and then um the influx of
 
01:47:44.629 --> 01:47:44.639 align:start position:0%
cases were to happen uh to the public
 
01:47:46.830 --> 01:47:46.840 align:start position:0%
defender office what would that look
 
01:47:49.270 --> 01:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
like uh individual to individual would
 
01:47:51.709 --> 01:47:51.719 align:start position:0%
there be people who
 
01:47:53.390 --> 01:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
lose their constitutional right to a
 
01:47:55.750 --> 01:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
defender in a trial and then just go to
 
01:47:58.510 --> 01:47:58.520 align:start position:0%
the trial without uh defense because
 
01:48:01.149 --> 01:48:01.159 align:start position:0%
they sort of get lost in the Deluge of
 
01:48:03.709 --> 01:48:03.719 align:start position:0%
of case load or would they just have to
 
01:48:06.270 --> 01:48:06.280 align:start position:0%
wait until getting a trial still sort of
 
01:48:09.550 --> 01:48:09.560 align:start position:0%
green to the whole system the the latter
 
01:48:11.950 --> 01:48:11.960 align:start position:0%
so you know the the court has never
 
01:48:15.189 --> 01:48:15.199 align:start position:0%
can't proceed um with somebody who is
 
01:48:17.109 --> 01:48:17.119 align:start position:0%
eligible for an attorney uh for a courta
 
01:48:19.229 --> 01:48:19.239 align:start position:0%
appointed attorney um and doesn't have
 
01:48:20.470 --> 01:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
one that you know the court can't
 
01:48:23.870 --> 01:48:23.880 align:start position:0%
proceed um and won't um so um you know
 
01:48:25.350 --> 01:48:25.360 align:start position:0%
in terms of if we're going to have to
 
01:48:27.430 --> 01:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
divert resources to covering same day
 
01:48:29.950 --> 01:48:29.960 align:start position:0%
Bale hearings um you know I I don't want
 
01:48:31.430 --> 01:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
to say for sure but one of the
 
01:48:34.750 --> 01:48:34.760 align:start position:0%
possibilities is that um you know other
 
01:48:36.830 --> 01:48:36.840 align:start position:0%
categories of cases might have to wait
 
01:48:39.270 --> 01:48:39.280 align:start position:0%
for their attorney we might go backward
 
01:48:42.589 --> 01:48:42.599 align:start position:0%
um to where we were um you know a year
 
01:48:45.550 --> 01:48:45.560 align:start position:0%
and a half ago with you know 1100 people
 
01:48:47.470 --> 01:48:47.480 align:start position:0%
on hold waiting you know for their
 
01:48:49.709 --> 01:48:49.719 align:start position:0%
attorney um and I I again I don't want
 
01:48:51.550 --> 01:48:51.560 align:start position:0%
to make that seem like that that's going
 
01:48:53.589 --> 01:48:53.599 align:start position:0%
to be our solution and that that's an
 
01:48:55.310 --> 01:48:55.320 align:start position:0%
inevitability I I don't want to make it
 
01:48:57.270 --> 01:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
seem like a threat frankly but um it's
 
01:48:59.030 --> 01:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
certainly one of the possibilities I
 
01:49:00.830 --> 01:49:00.840 align:start position:0%
mean if covering arraignments on a daily
 
01:49:02.470 --> 01:49:02.480 align:start position:0%
basis is going to take four hours of
 
01:49:05.709 --> 01:49:05.719 align:start position:0%
your day um there's only so many hours
 
01:49:07.070 --> 01:49:07.080 align:start position:0%
in a day and there's only so many people
 
01:49:09.790 --> 01:49:09.800 align:start position:0%
we have on staff that would be though
 
01:49:11.830 --> 01:49:11.840 align:start position:0%
only um it wouldn't be every day
 
01:49:13.629 --> 01:49:13.639 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it just be the the first
 
01:49:16.310 --> 01:49:16.320 align:start position:0%
business day after the weekend where all
 
01:49:17.550 --> 01:49:17.560 align:start position:0%
those who couldn't see a baill
 
01:49:19.430 --> 01:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner would have to see the judge
 
01:49:21.350 --> 01:49:21.360 align:start position:0%
oh no no it's every day of the week so
 
01:49:22.790 --> 01:49:22.800 align:start position:0%
if you're if you're not allowed to see a
 
01:49:24.709 --> 01:49:24.719 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner and you're being held
 
01:49:26.470 --> 01:49:26.480 align:start position:0%
could could you shut the door please I'm
 
01:49:29.149 --> 01:49:29.159 align:start position:0%
sorry um if you're no I mean if you're
 
01:49:31.350 --> 01:49:31.360 align:start position:0%
not allowed to see a bail commissioner
 
01:49:33.430 --> 01:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
um you know you get arrested at at at 2
 
01:49:35.189 --> 01:49:35.199 align:start position:0%
o'clock in the afternoon you're going to
 
01:49:37.109 --> 01:49:37.119 align:start position:0%
be held overnight and have a hearing in
 
01:49:38.229 --> 01:49:38.239 align:start position:0%
front of the judge where you have to
 
01:49:40.470 --> 01:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
have an attorney um and all that whole
 
01:49:42.030 --> 01:49:42.040 align:start position:0%
process that I talked about earlier so
 
01:49:44.149 --> 01:49:44.159 align:start position:0%
it's not just weekends it's so yeah so
 
01:49:46.229 --> 01:49:46.239 align:start position:0%
bail Commissioners when they bail
 
01:49:47.669 --> 01:49:47.679 align:start position:0%
someone they don't bail them to the next
 
01:49:50.629 --> 01:49:50.639 align:start position:0%
day they bail them to a maybe a
 
01:49:53.870 --> 01:49:53.880 align:start position:0%
a month for exact all those would be
 
01:49:58.390 --> 01:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:02.910 --> 01:50:02.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:05.830 --> 01:50:05.840 align:start position:0%
backward sorry thank you going back to
 
01:50:08.229 --> 01:50:08.239 align:start position:0%
January 1st when we start the old way of
 
01:50:10.589 --> 01:50:10.599 align:start position:0%
doing things what I Envision and correct
 
01:50:12.470 --> 01:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
me if I'm wrong but say you get arrested
 
01:50:14.310 --> 01:50:14.320 align:start position:0%
on a Wednesday you'll be on a felony
 
01:50:16.430 --> 01:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
case you'll be held you'll then be seen
 
01:50:19.109 --> 01:50:19.119 align:start position:0%
in court they'll go over their charges
 
01:50:21.070 --> 01:50:21.080 align:start position:0%
for the arraignment you'll fill out your
 
01:50:23.070 --> 01:50:23.080 align:start position:0%
affidavit to to see if you're eligible
 
01:50:24.910 --> 01:50:24.920 align:start position:0%
for a court appointment attorney then
 
01:50:26.430 --> 01:50:26.440 align:start position:0%
you'll probably end up with cash bail
 
01:50:28.430 --> 01:50:28.440 align:start position:0%
you'll go to the jail if you don't make
 
01:50:29.830 --> 01:50:29.840 align:start position:0%
the cash bail and then the public
 
01:50:31.030 --> 01:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
defender office is going to come
 
01:50:34.149 --> 01:50:34.159 align:start position:0%
involved at some point no so if with no
 
01:50:35.910 --> 01:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
change to the current bail statute what
 
01:50:37.629 --> 01:50:37.639 align:start position:0%
would happen is you get arrested on a
 
01:50:39.669 --> 01:50:39.679 align:start position:0%
Wednesday you see a bail commissioner
 
01:50:41.270 --> 01:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
and you might be released and then
 
01:50:43.550 --> 01:50:43.560 align:start position:0%
scheduled for an arraignment day a month
 
01:50:45.870 --> 01:50:45.880 align:start position:0%
later um and then you apply for your
 
01:50:47.629 --> 01:50:47.639 align:start position:0%
attorney and you get your attorney if
 
01:50:48.790 --> 01:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
you're not able to see a bail
 
01:50:51.109 --> 01:50:51.119 align:start position:0%
commissioner then you are held and you
 
01:50:52.950 --> 01:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
have that next day bail hearing with an
 
01:50:55.189 --> 01:50:55.199 align:start position:0%
attorney so we have to get involved each
 
01:50:57.629 --> 01:50:57.639 align:start position:0%
day provide an attorney correct okay
 
01:50:58.870 --> 01:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
yeah that's what I was looking at thank
 
01:50:58.880 --> 01:51:02.270 align:start position:0%
yeah that's what I was looking at thank
you

01:51:02.270 --> 01:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:05.109 --> 01:51:05.119 align:start position:0%
sure we've discussed and and I
 
01:51:06.270 --> 01:51:06.280 align:start position:0%
understand that your office doesn't have
 
01:51:08.069 --> 01:51:08.079 align:start position:0%
the bandwith or ability to do any
 
01:51:12.270 --> 01:51:12.280 align:start position:0%
weekend work is there a legal in your
 
01:51:16.669 --> 01:51:16.679 align:start position:0%
opinion method of being able to hold or
 
01:51:20.390 --> 01:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
have a judge sit um in lie of a bail
 
01:51:22.790 --> 01:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner on for example Saturday
 
01:51:26.109 --> 01:51:26.119 align:start position:0%
mornings um instead of in other words if
 
01:51:28.390 --> 01:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
we said okay here's a list of crimes the
 
01:51:30.669 --> 01:51:30.679 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner can't do the judge has
 
01:51:32.030 --> 01:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
to do them can the
 
01:51:35.990 --> 01:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
Judge hear those without the full
 
01:51:39.510 --> 01:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
panoply of Clerks and defense attorneys
 
01:51:42.589 --> 01:51:42.599 align:start position:0%
if it's just a a dangerousness hearing
 
01:51:45.910 --> 01:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
for up to another 24 to 48 hours I mean
 
01:51:48.189 --> 01:51:48.199 align:start position:0%
I if you create a law that says that
 
01:51:50.990 --> 01:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
they can then well laws can't supered
 
01:51:52.709 --> 01:51:52.719 align:start position:0%
the Constitution so I want to make sure
 
01:51:57.109 --> 01:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
that we oby the supreme law you know I I
 
01:51:59.589 --> 01:51:59.599 align:start position:0%
mean do can people be arraigned without
 
01:52:01.430 --> 01:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
Council yes I mean but then they would
 
01:52:03.350 --> 01:52:03.360 align:start position:0%
still have a right to a hearing with
 
01:52:05.589 --> 01:52:05.599 align:start position:0%
Council um and you know that would still
 
01:52:08.390 --> 01:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
need to be um as soon as possible you
 
01:52:10.149 --> 01:52:10.159 align:start position:0%
know what I mean the next business day
 
01:52:12.510 --> 01:52:12.520 align:start position:0%
and so then we're still postponing the
 
01:52:15.870 --> 01:52:15.880 align:start position:0%
inevitable I think so all right yeah
 
01:52:17.510 --> 01:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
representative rhods thank you Mr
 
01:52:17.520 --> 01:52:18.870 align:start position:0%
representative rhods thank you Mr
chairman

01:52:18.870 --> 01:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:52:23.510 --> 01:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
just so the the bill reform not really
 
01:52:25.709 --> 01:52:25.719 align:start position:0%
sure if this would be Bill reform reform
 
01:52:28.750 --> 01:52:28.760 align:start position:0%
um so was before I when you know was
 
01:52:31.229 --> 01:52:31.239 align:start position:0%
elected so um can you explain the
 
01:52:34.310 --> 01:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
difference between how you operated
 
01:52:38.229 --> 01:52:38.239 align:start position:0%
Before the bill reform and now and what
 
01:52:39.950 --> 01:52:39.960 align:start position:0%
the difference would be be now if it was
 
01:52:43.350 --> 01:52:43.360 align:start position:0%
reform reform sure so before the First
 
01:52:46.589 --> 01:52:46.599 align:start position:0%
Reform um there was sure yeah before
 
01:52:48.669 --> 01:52:48.679 align:start position:0%
2018 we'll say it that way that's a good
 
01:52:51.629 --> 01:52:51.639 align:start position:0%
one um so before 2018 I think the
 
01:52:54.189 --> 01:52:54.199 align:start position:0%
biggest difference is cash or shity bail
 
01:52:56.350 --> 01:52:56.360 align:start position:0%
so is shity bail right and that's what
 
01:53:00.870 --> 01:53:00.880 align:start position:0%
2018 really did was get rid of um bail
 
01:53:04.270 --> 01:53:04.280 align:start position:0%
what are I lost my words I forgot the
 
01:53:06.270 --> 01:53:06.280 align:start position:0%
not a bail commissioner but um bail
 
01:53:08.950 --> 01:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
bondsman thank you um it largely got rid
 
01:53:10.350 --> 01:53:10.360 align:start position:0%
of bail bondsman there's no bail
 
01:53:12.430 --> 01:53:12.440 align:start position:0%
bondsman operating um in New Hampshire
 
01:53:15.270 --> 01:53:15.280 align:start position:0%
because so before um you know the bail
 
01:53:17.550 --> 01:53:17.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner or later if you didn't see
 
01:53:18.750 --> 01:53:18.760 align:start position:0%
a bail commissioner or the bail
 
01:53:21.069 --> 01:53:21.079 align:start position:0%
commissioner held you judge would
 
01:53:24.030 --> 01:53:24.040 align:start position:0%
largely could have the options of
 
01:53:25.870 --> 01:53:25.880 align:start position:0%
releasing you on your personal
 
01:53:28.629 --> 01:53:28.639 align:start position:0%
recognizance um or setting cash bail or
 
01:53:31.750 --> 01:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
setting cash or shity bail um and so
 
01:53:35.229 --> 01:53:35.239 align:start position:0%
2018 largely got rid of bail bondsmen um
 
01:53:37.669 --> 01:53:37.679 align:start position:0%
which was I think very appropriate um
 
01:53:41.189 --> 01:53:41.199 align:start position:0%
because um so say I saw um the bail
 
01:53:42.790 --> 01:53:42.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner and my bail was set at
 
01:53:45.430 --> 01:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
$5,000 cash or shity so what that would
 
01:53:48.390 --> 01:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
mean is I could either post $5,000 in
 
01:53:51.030 --> 01:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
cash or me or my family member could
 
01:53:53.430 --> 01:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
contact a bail bond company to post a
 
01:53:57.189 --> 01:53:57.199 align:start position:0%
bond so a bond was at the minimum 10% so
 
01:53:59.270 --> 01:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
on 5,000 I'd have to post
 
01:54:01.990 --> 01:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
$500 um to to get out and then there was
 
01:54:03.750 --> 01:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
additional fees so usually for like a
 
01:54:07.149 --> 01:54:07.159 align:start position:0%
$5,000 shity Bond a family would end up
 
01:54:10.470 --> 01:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
paying somewhere say say s or $800 to
 
01:54:12.950 --> 01:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
get that person out of jail um so that
 
01:54:14.669 --> 01:54:14.679 align:start position:0%
was resulting number one in people who
 
01:54:16.910 --> 01:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
just could not afford that and so then
 
01:54:18.350 --> 01:54:18.360 align:start position:0%
even though judges thought that they
 
01:54:20.229 --> 01:54:20.239 align:start position:0%
were giving people an opportunity
 
01:54:21.990 --> 01:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
release really they were just holding
 
01:54:23.470 --> 01:54:23.480 align:start position:0%
that was an effective hold on that
 
01:54:25.750 --> 01:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
person um but even for the person who
 
01:54:27.589 --> 01:54:27.599 align:start position:0%
could afford it that money was going to
 
01:54:29.589 --> 01:54:29.599 align:start position:0%
a bail bondsman who then very frankly
 
01:54:31.870 --> 01:54:31.880 align:start position:0%
would provide no service to anybody um
 
01:54:33.229 --> 01:54:33.239 align:start position:0%
they would not remind clients about
 
01:54:35.510 --> 01:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
courts um if you know if they didn't
 
01:54:37.109 --> 01:54:37.119 align:start position:0%
show up to court I think we all have a
 
01:54:38.990 --> 01:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
vision of like television the bail
 
01:54:41.510 --> 01:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
bondsman comes and and takes you they
 
01:54:43.430 --> 01:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
they don't do that they wait for law
 
01:54:45.470 --> 01:54:45.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement to arrest you and then you
 
01:54:47.910 --> 01:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
know they collect their paychecks so um
 
01:54:50.430 --> 01:54:50.440 align:start position:0%
they were getting 10% for doing nothing
 
01:54:53.030 --> 01:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
um and so that's why that was largely
 
01:54:55.990 --> 01:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
done away with so the 2018 reform really
 
01:54:59.310 --> 01:54:59.320 align:start position:0%
focused on um you know either
 
01:55:00.709 --> 01:55:00.719 align:start position:0%
determining whether people were good
 
01:55:01.990 --> 01:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
candidates for bail and safe to be
 
01:55:04.149 --> 01:55:04.159 align:start position:0%
released and if so you know we don't
 
01:55:06.629 --> 01:55:06.639 align:start position:0%
need to set these cash assurity bonds
 
01:55:08.470 --> 01:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
because they're just safe to be released
 
01:55:10.069 --> 01:55:10.079 align:start position:0%
or they're dangerous and we need to hold
 
01:55:12.069 --> 01:55:12.079 align:start position:0%
them on preventative detention um so
 
01:55:14.669 --> 01:55:14.679 align:start position:0%
that was a big change as it created um
 
01:55:17.390 --> 01:55:17.400 align:start position:0%
you know preventative detention bail um
 
01:55:20.069 --> 01:55:20.079 align:start position:0%
and then um there is there were is a
 
01:55:22.510 --> 01:55:22.520 align:start position:0%
provision for cash bail um particularly
 
01:55:24.870 --> 01:55:24.880 align:start position:0%
for failures to appear um but there's
 
01:55:26.709 --> 01:55:26.719 align:start position:0%
language in the statute that talks about
 
01:55:28.629 --> 01:55:28.639 align:start position:0%
you know you can't be the judge needs to
 
01:55:30.030 --> 01:55:30.040 align:start position:0%
make a determination that you're not
 
01:55:31.910 --> 01:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
being held solely just because you can't
 
01:55:35.149 --> 01:55:35.159 align:start position:0%
afford the cash bail that is set um so
 
01:55:37.550 --> 01:55:37.560 align:start position:0%
that was the 2018 you know bail reform
 
01:55:40.350 --> 01:55:40.360 align:start position:0%
it it largely it was a move toward and
 
01:55:42.229 --> 01:55:42.239 align:start position:0%
not fully but a move toward like the
 
01:55:44.350 --> 01:55:44.360 align:start position:0%
federal model which is you either get
 
01:55:45.709 --> 01:55:45.719 align:start position:0%
out on your recognizance or you're
 
01:55:48.229 --> 01:55:48.239 align:start position:0%
dangerous and we're holding you um so it
 
01:55:49.910 --> 01:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
it was a move toward that which is a lot
 
01:55:51.950 --> 01:55:51.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of states are slowly starting to
 
01:55:54.470 --> 01:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
adopt that model and seeing that um
 
01:55:55.990 --> 01:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
number one that money doesn't make
 
01:55:58.629 --> 01:55:58.639 align:start position:0%
people safe just because I have $700 and
 
01:56:00.229 --> 01:56:00.239 align:start position:0%
can afford my bail that doesn't make me
 
01:56:02.109 --> 01:56:02.119 align:start position:0%
any safer than somebody who is indent
 
01:56:03.350 --> 01:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
and can't afford the
 
01:56:05.709 --> 01:56:05.719 align:start position:0%
$700 um but then also just the idea that
 
01:56:07.669 --> 01:56:07.679 align:start position:0%
we should be doing more analysis of
 
01:56:10.430 --> 01:56:10.440 align:start position:0%
really who is safe and who is not you
 
01:56:12.390 --> 01:56:12.400 align:start position:0%
know we should be looking at that more
 
01:56:13.870 --> 01:56:13.880 align:start position:0%
than just picking a random amount of
 
01:56:16.629 --> 01:56:16.639 align:start position:0%
cash or shy bail to set for this person
 
01:56:18.910 --> 01:56:18.920 align:start position:0%
um so that's where we are now um and
 
01:56:20.709 --> 01:56:20.719 align:start position:0%
then this ch would like we've talked
 
01:56:23.350 --> 01:56:23.360 align:start position:0%
about prohibit large categories of
 
01:56:24.910 --> 01:56:24.920 align:start position:0%
people um from seeing a bail
 
01:56:26.669 --> 01:56:26.679 align:start position:0%
commissioner and then resulting in them
 
01:56:28.950 --> 01:56:28.960 align:start position:0%
being definitely held and definitely
 
01:56:31.629 --> 01:56:31.639 align:start position:0%
needing a hearing with a lawyer um in in
 
01:56:31.639 --> 01:56:35.310 align:start position:0%
needing a hearing with a lawyer um in in
short

01:56:35.310 --> 01:56:35.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:35.320 --> 01:56:39.270 align:start position:0%
 
order

01:56:39.270 --> 01:56:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:43.990 --> 01:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:47.709 --> 01:56:47.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:49.950 --> 01:56:49.960 align:start position:0%
I I'm not trying to just sound
 
01:56:52.069 --> 01:56:52.079 align:start position:0%
argumentative and I'm afraid that I'm
 
01:56:53.310 --> 01:56:53.320 align:start position:0%
afraid that that's how this is going to
 
01:56:55.990 --> 01:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
come across so I apologize it it's not
 
01:56:59.470 --> 01:56:59.480 align:start position:0%
okay so I do understand the reason that
 
01:57:01.069 --> 01:57:01.079 align:start position:0%
they went in I don't I understand the
 
01:57:03.990 --> 01:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
reasoning for the 2018 changes what I'm
 
01:57:07.189 --> 01:57:07.199 align:start position:0%
confused on is the you're saying your
 
01:57:08.750 --> 01:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
office not being able to
 
01:57:11.149 --> 01:57:11.159 align:start position:0%
handle what may be what could
 
01:57:13.990 --> 01:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
potentially be coming so I'm just trying
 
01:57:16.790 --> 01:57:16.800 align:start position:0%
to figure out how why how is it going to
 
01:57:18.510 --> 01:57:18.520 align:start position:0%
be any different from what it was before
 
01:57:22.589 --> 01:57:22.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:24.990 --> 01:57:25.000 align:start position:0%
that's my question sure no and and no
 
01:57:26.669 --> 01:57:26.679 align:start position:0%
and that that that's a good question I I
 
01:57:28.709 --> 01:57:28.719 align:start position:0%
definitely understand that question the
 
01:57:30.430 --> 01:57:30.440 align:start position:0%
difference is is that there's still that
 
01:57:31.950 --> 01:57:31.960 align:start position:0%
percent like people can see a bail
 
01:57:33.550 --> 01:57:33.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner and those are folks and
 
01:57:34.950 --> 01:57:34.960 align:start position:0%
then they just get released and it's not
 
01:57:37.149 --> 01:57:37.159 align:start position:0%
as if we never see them but we don't see
 
01:57:40.709 --> 01:57:40.719 align:start position:0%
them until you know they have an A we
 
01:57:42.149 --> 01:57:42.159 align:start position:0%
call them walk-in arraignment so you
 
01:57:43.550 --> 01:57:43.560 align:start position:0%
know the court schedules you know a
 
01:57:44.870 --> 01:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
couple of times a month they have these
 
01:57:46.950 --> 01:57:46.960 align:start position:0%
arraignments and then they get Council
 
01:57:48.390 --> 01:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
and then we get a court date that is
 
01:57:50.390 --> 01:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
maybe six weeks down down the road where
 
01:57:51.750 --> 01:57:51.760 align:start position:0%
we have time to meet with that client
 
01:57:53.629 --> 01:57:53.639 align:start position:0%
and start working on their case and you
 
01:57:54.870 --> 01:57:54.880 align:start position:0%
know that the first court date that
 
01:57:56.350 --> 01:57:56.360 align:start position:0%
we're attending is a meaningful hearing
 
01:57:58.709 --> 01:57:58.719 align:start position:0%
where maybe we can resolve that case um
 
01:58:00.229 --> 01:58:00.239 align:start position:0%
so that is the main difference the main
 
01:58:01.709 --> 01:58:01.719 align:start position:0%
difference is they're not going to have
 
01:58:03.030 --> 01:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
this opportunity to see a bail
 
01:58:04.950 --> 01:58:04.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner such that my office doesn't
 
01:58:07.430 --> 01:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
even have to be involved until further
 
01:58:11.750 --> 01:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
Downstream in the case but prior to 2018
 
01:58:14.669 --> 01:58:14.679 align:start position:0%
were people just being held I mean so in
 
01:58:16.069 --> 01:58:16.079 align:start position:0%
other words I think what the
 
01:58:18.189 --> 01:58:18.199 align:start position:0%
representative is asking is if you were
 
01:58:20.589 --> 01:58:20.599 align:start position:0%
operating under that system in 2018 and
 
01:58:22.669 --> 01:58:22.679 align:start position:0%
it went back a little towards that now
 
01:58:25.430 --> 01:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
how would that be different so I I maybe
 
01:58:26.990 --> 01:58:27.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not I apologize if I'm not being
 
01:58:28.990 --> 01:58:29.000 align:start position:0%
clear even under the prior scheme where
 
01:58:31.189 --> 01:58:31.199 align:start position:0%
there was you know shity bail they had
 
01:58:33.189 --> 01:58:33.199 align:start position:0%
access to a bail commissioner so there
 
01:58:35.510 --> 01:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
was the opportunity that either they
 
01:58:36.830 --> 01:58:36.840 align:start position:0%
would just be released on personal
 
01:58:38.790 --> 01:58:38.800 align:start position:0%
recognizance or they would get some sort
 
01:58:40.390 --> 01:58:40.400 align:start position:0%
of bail set that they could post and
 
01:58:42.790 --> 01:58:42.800 align:start position:0%
afford and then they would be released
 
01:58:44.750 --> 01:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
and that would not result in a next day
 
01:58:46.830 --> 01:58:46.840 align:start position:0%
hearing for us so certainly under the
 
01:58:49.149 --> 01:58:49.159 align:start position:0%
prior scheme where I was talking about
 
01:58:51.229 --> 01:58:51.239 align:start position:0%
um um you know cash ory bail resulting
 
01:58:54.350 --> 01:58:54.360 align:start position:0%
in some people being held then um you
 
01:58:58.109 --> 01:58:58.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:01.990 --> 01:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
actually they those people we
 
01:59:04.470 --> 01:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
because those people still had the
 
01:59:06.310 --> 01:59:06.320 align:start position:0%
access to see the bail commissioner so
 
01:59:09.030 --> 01:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
it's still fewer folks right so even if
 
01:59:10.390 --> 01:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
there were people who were getting cash
 
01:59:13.149 --> 01:59:13.159 align:start position:0%
or shity bail that they could not afford
 
01:59:16.589 --> 01:59:16.599 align:start position:0%
um then we would have to number one it
 
01:59:18.750 --> 01:59:18.760 align:start position:0%
it because it also ties into felonies
 
01:59:20.350 --> 01:59:20.360 align:start position:0%
first so it get a little complicated you
 
01:59:22.030 --> 01:59:22.040 align:start position:0%
know because it was back in the circuit
 
01:59:25.709 --> 01:59:25.719 align:start position:0%
court and so they didn't actually have
 
01:59:27.750 --> 01:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
um the same access to next day hearings
 
01:59:31.790 --> 01:59:31.800 align:start position:0%
that they currently have so um but by by
 
01:59:33.910 --> 01:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
and large the answer is that those
 
01:59:35.510 --> 01:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
people even though some of them still
 
01:59:37.270 --> 01:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
got held because they had shity bail
 
01:59:39.270 --> 01:59:39.280 align:start position:0%
that they could not afford other people
 
01:59:42.669 --> 01:59:42.679 align:start position:0%
got personal recognizance bail um or got
 
01:59:44.390 --> 01:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
um assurity bond you know that they
 
01:59:46.550 --> 01:59:46.560 align:start position:0%
could afford and they could post um so
 
01:59:47.990 --> 01:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
that we didn't have these next day
 
01:59:49.870 --> 01:59:49.880 align:start position:0%
hearings this stat statutory scheme
 
01:59:52.069 --> 01:59:52.079 align:start position:0%
that's being proposed here now would
 
01:59:55.189 --> 01:59:55.199 align:start position:0%
create a large category of cases that by
 
01:59:56.990 --> 01:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
by definition are going to be next day
 
01:59:58.790 --> 01:59:58.800 align:start position:0%
bail hearings for us and that did not
 
02:00:03.390 --> 02:00:03.400 align:start position:0%
exist before I think that any further
 
02:00:05.669 --> 02:00:05.679 align:start position:0%
questions see none thank you very much
 
02:00:07.950 --> 02:00:07.960 align:start position:0%

Committee in the past yes I just wanted

to um if I may let the committee know
 
02:01:07.390 --> 02:01:07.400 align:start position:0%
that uh we were able to make
 
02:01:09.830 --> 02:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
arrangements for cheser County to come
 
02:01:12.709 --> 02:01:12.719 align:start position:0%
tomorrow and talk with us about the the
 
02:01:15.069 --> 02:01:15.079 align:start position:0%
pre-trial in all the diversion programs
 
02:01:19.149 --> 02:01:19.159 align:start position:0%
that we have so uh bring your pen be
 
02:01:21.149 --> 02:01:21.159 align:start position:0%
because we have a lot of programs that
 
02:01:23.189 --> 02:01:23.199 align:start position:0%
weren't even mentioned um from a lot of
 
02:01:26.109 --> 02:01:26.119 align:start position:0%
the other counties so hopefully we can
 
02:01:28.470 --> 02:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
learn a lot from that tomorrow and be
 
02:01:29.910 --> 02:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
ready to ask some questions get a lot of
 
02:01:31.709 --> 02:01:31.719 align:start position:0%
questions answered and I believe they
 
02:01:34.870 --> 02:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
have some good cost cost saving um from
 
02:01:36.870 --> 02:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
there as well so that's what we're
 
02:01:38.709 --> 02:01:38.719 align:start position:0%
looking at at the same
 
02:01:41.709 --> 02:01:41.719 align:start position:0%
time just reminder that I won't be here
 
02:01:44.589 --> 02:01:44.599 align:start position:0%
tomorrow if um someone else is prepared
 
02:01:45.950 --> 02:01:45.960 align:start position:0%
to take
 
02:01:49.870 --> 02:01:49.880 align:start position:0%
notes yeah not I I think
 
02:01:54.069 --> 02:01:54.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:08.950 --> 02:02:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:08.960 --> 02:02:11.960 align:start position:0%
 
night
