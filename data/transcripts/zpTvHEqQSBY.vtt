00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
211 New Hampshire said that they would
 
00:12:42.829 --> 00:12:42.839 align:start position:0%
be able to
 
00:12:46.629 --> 00:12:46.639 align:start position:0%
also it was just that at that point they
 
00:12:49.949 --> 00:12:49.959 align:start position:0%
had little resources to actually turn
 
00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
the people over to for assistance so
 
00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:56.680 align:start position:0%
right now we are working through um
 
00:12:59.870 --> 00:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
putting out an RFP in in order to have
 
00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:03.320 align:start position:0%
that hotline answered and then hopefully
 
00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:05.480 align:start position:0%
further working with whoever it is
 
00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
awarded to in order to find the
 
00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
resources to actually get these people
 
00:13:16.829 --> 00:13:16.839 align:start position:0%
help so in a nutshell that's the past 13
 
00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
years okay well thank you for that so
 
00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:23.560 align:start position:0%
I'll have a first question here um so
 
00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:26.600 align:start position:0%
when we did historic racing machines um
 
00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
there was a provision that all the
 
00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:29.800 align:start position:0%
breakage you got
 
00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:32.920 align:start position:0%
the was to go to this
 
00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
fund um we learned the other day the
 
00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
last meeting that two of the three
 
00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
vendors that provide the historic racing
 
00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
machines are complying with that and
 
00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
that's another agender item we're going
 
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
to talk about but so that money is going
 
00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
into the same fund
 
00:13:52.949 --> 00:13:52.959 align:start position:0%
correct actually I answer that okay uh
 
00:13:55.629 --> 00:13:55.639 align:start position:0%
it was it's in law but not in
 
00:13:59.350 --> 00:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
budget so it has to be in both
 
00:14:02.189 --> 00:14:02.199 align:start position:0%
it was unbudgeted as part of
 
00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:05.320 align:start position:0%
the the state budget so the the council
 
00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:06.310 align:start position:0%
the the state budget so the the council
gets

00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
gets
 
00:14:09.069 --> 00:14:09.079 align:start position:0%
$2,000 the funding source is breakage if
 
00:14:13.189 --> 00:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
it exceeds that um then the money you
 
00:14:15.269 --> 00:14:15.279 align:start position:0%
know understand what I'm saying say so
 
00:14:16.949 --> 00:14:16.959 align:start position:0%
so where's the breakage going so the
 
00:14:18.749 --> 00:14:18.759 align:start position:0%
breakage is going to responsible
 
00:14:21.629 --> 00:14:21.639 align:start position:0%
gambling it's just in in past years the
 
00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:23.680 align:start position:0%
number for breakage has exceeded the
 
00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:24.710 align:start position:0%
number for breakage has exceeded the
amount

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
amount
 
00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:26.959 align:start position:0%
budgeted this year it won't because it
 
00:14:29.189 --> 00:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
was as as Morris suggested it's been
 
00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
raised to $50,000 I got it okay
 
00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
so so do do one more time I don't have
 
00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:38.470 align:start position:0%
so so do do one more time I don't have
certainly

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
so obviously there was a dedicated fund
 
00:14:43.749 --> 00:14:43.759 align:start position:0%
to fund responsible gambling right that
 
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
Source was breakage in Prior years
 
00:14:48.829 --> 00:14:48.839 align:start position:0%
breakage amount exceeded the amount
 
00:14:51.509 --> 00:14:51.519 align:start position:0%
budgeted okay and so the exess returns
 
00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
to the education trust fund okay that's
 
00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
what okay I got it I don't keep it all
 
00:14:59.110 --> 00:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
right let me turn to the education one
 
00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:01.000 align:start position:0%
all right so so what we're saying is
 
00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:03.560 align:start position:0%
that uh if we budgeted 250 you're back
 
00:15:05.069 --> 00:15:05.079 align:start position:0%
to 250
 
00:15:05.079 --> 00:15:09.829 align:start position:0%
to 250
again

00:15:09.829 --> 00:15:09.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
right so if we're back up to 250 can we
 
00:15:15.829 --> 00:15:15.839 align:start position:0%
over ever exceed to 250 if if the
 
00:15:18.069 --> 00:15:18.079 align:start position:0%
breakage is exceeds to 250 it doesn't
 
00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:20.360 align:start position:0%
sound like it or if we have to do
 
00:15:22.189 --> 00:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
something next buer cycle that would
 
00:15:24.269 --> 00:15:24.279 align:start position:0%
yeah we have to do the next budget cycle
 
00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
okay to
 
00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
to well then but then the finance have
 
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
to figure out how much is coming from um
 
00:15:33.069 --> 00:15:33.079 align:start position:0%
how much we anticipate it's going to
 
00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
come from the breakage I mean we'll have
 
00:15:36.269 --> 00:15:36.279 align:start position:0%
a better handle on it because we
 
00:15:38.189 --> 00:15:38.199 align:start position:0%
obviously now we have experience right
 
00:15:40.309 --> 00:15:40.319 align:start position:0%
moreover there's not a breakage fund
 
00:15:42.629 --> 00:15:42.639 align:start position:0%
coming from the not just one of the
 
00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
manufacturers but the largest by far is
 
00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
not funding
 
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
breakage okay and so in break we would
 
00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
may want to legislative fix to that
 
00:15:57.629 --> 00:15:57.639 align:start position:0%
that's an ex agender item so so okay so
 
00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:00.160 align:start position:0%
uh questions
 
00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:09.309 --> 00:16:09.319 align:start position:0%
you yeah just backing up a little bit
 
00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
um you're with
 
00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:15.480 align:start position:0%
the Lottery Commission I am I am
 
00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
actually the director of marketing and
 
00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:20.680 align:start position:0%
advertising with the lottery yeah which
 
00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:23.480 align:start position:0%
is a very nice place to
 
00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
be because it goes hand inand with
 
00:16:30.269 --> 00:16:30.279 align:start position:0%
understanding responsible gambling so
 
00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:33.240 align:start position:0%
whenever I'm working on a
 
00:16:36.629 --> 00:16:36.639 align:start position:0%
project to promote Lottery to promote
 
00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:39.759 align:start position:0%
our games that responsible gambling is
 
00:16:42.749 --> 00:16:42.759 align:start position:0%
always in the back of my head
 
00:16:47.309 --> 00:16:47.319 align:start position:0%
yeah and then um you're part
 
00:16:50.629 --> 00:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
of the you're appointed
 
00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
to the council is that list nominated by
 
00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
the governor and approved by the
 
00:16:58.110 --> 00:16:58.120 align:start position:0%
executive Council and the name of the
 
00:16:58.120 --> 00:16:59.110 align:start position:0%
executive Council and the name of the
organ

00:16:59.110 --> 00:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
organ
 
00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.150 align:start position:0%
organ
of

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:17:02.749 --> 00:17:02.759 align:start position:0%
this The Entity we're now talking about
 
00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
is what the New Hampshire Council for
 
00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:09.400 align:start position:0%
responsible gambling have a council for
 
00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:12.520 align:start position:0%
respons and who who's on who are the
 
00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:13.880 align:start position:0%
others besides
 
00:17:17.909 --> 00:17:17.919 align:start position:0%
you uh we have four other members uh two
 
00:17:24.549 --> 00:17:24.559 align:start position:0%
of them are um doctors that work with
 
00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:28.520 align:start position:0%
addiction I just double checking yeah I
 
00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:31.280 align:start position:0%
I was shown uh uh would you like me to
 
00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
continue or do you do have L of five
 
00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
well I I see um and how often do you
 
00:17:40.029 --> 00:17:40.039 align:start position:0%
meet we try to meet
 
00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
quarterly um unfortunately um throughout
 
00:17:45.549 --> 00:17:45.559 align:start position:0%
the covid years it was a little bit more
 
00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
difficult and uh this particular year we
 
00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
have not been able to meet um on that
 
00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
quarterly basis but we are in touch with
 
00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
each other okay all right right
 
00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
um and then what you meet and talk about
 
00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
is the uh agenda for problem gam
 
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
gambling and the money that uh has been
 
00:18:14.029 --> 00:18:14.039 align:start position:0%
the finances yes as well as the RFP as
 
00:18:18.029 --> 00:18:18.039 align:start position:0%
well as um the research that goes in um
 
00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:21.240 align:start position:0%
prior to the RFP being U
 
00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:22.789 align:start position:0%
prior to the RFP being U
drafted

00:18:22.789 --> 00:18:22.799 align:start position:0%
drafted
 
00:18:25.789 --> 00:18:25.799 align:start position:0%
okay is there a sense of things that
 
00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
need to be done but we can't do them uh
 
00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
kind you know your perspective sitting
 
00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
on this Council and you asked to deal
 
00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:36.360 align:start position:0%
with responsible gambling or problem
 
00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:38.200 align:start position:0%
gambling which everyone one wants to
 
00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
call it and uh but oh gosh we can't do
 
00:18:43.909 --> 00:18:43.919 align:start position:0%
this because you know this that and the
 
00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
other thing yes can you can you talk
 
00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:49.000 align:start position:0%
about that sure so over the past 13
 
00:18:51.789 --> 00:18:51.799 align:start position:0%
years we have made great strides um
 
00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:55.000 align:start position:0%
great strides in getting information out
 
00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
regarding problem gambling there are
 
00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:00.360 align:start position:0%
posters as as well as brochures that are
 
00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:03.880 align:start position:0%
in each charitable gaming location um
 
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
there is our website of course that also
 
00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:10.360 align:start position:0%
provides assistance and we work uh with
 
00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:15.200 align:start position:0%
the National Council um and as well as
 
00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:19.480 align:start position:0%
uh locally here so again right now we
 
00:19:22.789 --> 00:19:22.799 align:start position:0%
certainly need a hotline that's up and
 
00:19:25.669 --> 00:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
running as well as the resources to send
 
00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:28.840 align:start position:0%
those people to once they make
 
00:19:31.669 --> 00:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
call there are other projects that we
 
00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:35.240 align:start position:0%
would very much like to become a part of
 
00:19:39.549 --> 00:19:39.559 align:start position:0%
and that would be the ability
 
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
to exclude yourself from going into a
 
00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:46.520 align:start position:0%
charitable casino and do it online
 
00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:49.240 align:start position:0%
currently in order to do that they must
 
00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
go into the casino in order to complete
 
00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:55.880 align:start position:0%
the paperwork to exclude themselves but
 
00:19:59.029 --> 00:19:59.039 align:start position:0%
the ability to do it online and to share
 
00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:03.240 align:start position:0%
it throughout the 10 to 15 casinos here
 
00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
on okay well why don't I I'll leave at
 
00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:14.600 align:start position:0%
that for okay I have another question so
 
00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:16.400 align:start position:0%
do you keep statistics on how many
 
00:20:19.029 --> 00:20:19.039 align:start position:0%
people are actually trying to access a
 
00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:21.400 align:start position:0%
hotline or do we have those kind of
 
00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:24.760 align:start position:0%
numbers the local um gentleman Ed Talbot
 
00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
that answers he gets about five to six
 
00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:29.320 align:start position:0%
calls a month
 
00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
and then I spoke with the national uh
 
00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:35.320 align:start position:0%
Council and they tell me they get about
 
00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
50 calls a
 
00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
month so interesting because you know we
 
00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
uh actually representative Ames got this
 
00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
letter from Ed
 
00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:49.400 align:start position:0%
talet and then I tried to track Ed talet
 
00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:53.000 align:start position:0%
down at the number and it was part of
 
00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
another uh charitable group that they
 
00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
said he's not part of the charitable
 
00:20:58.669 --> 00:20:58.679 align:start position:0%
group anymore so I had trouble finding
 
00:21:00.909 --> 00:21:00.919 align:start position:0%
him so maybe after the meeting or you
 
00:21:03.029 --> 00:21:03.039 align:start position:0%
can email I will get in touch with you
 
00:21:05.789 --> 00:21:05.799 align:start position:0%
yes we'd like to talk to it eventually
 
00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
as well so he's more the guy on the
 
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.710 align:start position:0%
as well so he's more the guy on the
ground

00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:09.720 align:start position:0%
ground
 
00:21:13.149 --> 00:21:13.159 align:start position:0%
actually his people dealing with he
 
00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
answers the phone the problem gambling
 
00:21:17.149 --> 00:21:17.159 align:start position:0%
the number that's locally here in New
 
00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:19.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire yes okay all right so we may
 
00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
have him at another meeting thank you
 
00:21:24.149 --> 00:21:24.159 align:start position:0%
for that so when when the
 
00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:27.480 align:start position:0%
250,000 that com out of a general fund
 
00:21:29.909 --> 00:21:29.919 align:start position:0%
I'll ask you to try no it's Ed it's
 
00:21:31.549 --> 00:21:31.559 align:start position:0%
Lottery funds it comes out of Lottery
 
00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
funds correct okay all right just want
 
00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
to understand that all right any other
 
00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:37.880 align:start position:0%
questions it's was considered an expense
 
00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:40.440 align:start position:0%
of the lottery right thank you for
 
00:21:41.789 --> 00:21:41.799 align:start position:0%
taking my question so my question is
 
00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
going to come around the idea of
 
00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:46.600 align:start position:0%
self-exclusion and how that's managed
 
00:21:47.789 --> 00:21:47.799 align:start position:0%
here in the state of New Hampshire can
 
00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:49.480 align:start position:0%
you speak a little further on that I
 
00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:50.600 align:start position:0%
understand there's a
 
00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
little a call it a fluffle going on
 
00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:56.120 align:start position:0%
between how one someone who might be
 
00:21:58.710 --> 00:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
self- excluded from one entity can walk
 
00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
into another entity and there's no
 
00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
tracking of that person's excluded
 
00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:04.840 align:start position:0%
excluded thems and would be able to walk
 
00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:07.320 align:start position:0%
in can you talk about ideas around that
 
00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
right so the thought is well
 
00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
currently in order to self-exclude from
 
00:22:15.549 --> 00:22:15.559 align:start position:0%
all of them the individual would have to
 
00:22:18.789 --> 00:22:18.799 align:start position:0%
visit each Casino complete each
 
00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
paperwork in order to be
 
00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:23.720 align:start position:0%
self-excluded what we would like to do
 
00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
and we've spoken with other groups that
 
00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:29.480 align:start position:0%
do it for example in Massachusetts game
 
00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
sense in
 
00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts they have a self-exclusion
 
00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
online where you can exclude yourself
 
00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
from all of the entities at the same
 
00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:44.120 align:start position:0%
time and that information is shared with
 
00:22:48.269 --> 00:22:48.279 align:start position:0%
each entity be at each
 
00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
Casino oh so that's a
 
00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
contracted process not the state holding
 
00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
the data but somebody else holding the
 
00:22:59.149 --> 00:22:59.159 align:start position:0%
data anding
 
00:23:02.149 --> 00:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:07.029 --> 00:23:07.039 align:start position:0%
you yes I apologize being for being late
 
00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
uh but with with the with reference to
 
00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:13.230 align:start position:0%
uh but with with the with reference to
the

00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:13.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:23:16.149 --> 00:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
exclusion we have we have a number of
 
00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:18.360 align:start position:0%
facilities operating at the present time
 
00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
we think we have 10 maybe we have 15
 
00:23:24.029 --> 00:23:24.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:26.909 --> 00:23:26.919 align:start position:0%
20 is it it from your from your
 
00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:29.440 align:start position:0%
standpoint is it the responsibility of
 
00:23:32.549 --> 00:23:32.559 align:start position:0%
the entities to share the exclusionary
 
00:23:35.269 --> 00:23:35.279 align:start position:0%
information if someone has has done that
 
00:23:38.029 --> 00:23:38.039 align:start position:0%
or does each one have to have to
 
00:23:41.149 --> 00:23:41.159 align:start position:0%
identify and keep the data them
 
00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:43.640 align:start position:0%
themselves currently they all keep the
 
00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:46.400 align:start position:0%
data themselves and they do not share it
 
00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
with the other
 
00:23:51.269 --> 00:23:51.279 align:start position:0%
entities forther question Mr CH oh yeah
 
00:23:53.950 --> 00:23:53.960 align:start position:0%
follow okay does doesn't that appear to
 
00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:57.080 align:start position:0%
be problematic to to you that if you
 
00:23:58.710 --> 00:23:58.720 align:start position:0%
know about it and they're at another
 
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
venue and you haven't shared that
 
00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:03.880 align:start position:0%
information with them uh it's you're
 
00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
exacerbating the problem certainly it's
 
00:24:09.789 --> 00:24:09.799 align:start position:0%
difficult to have to send somebody into
 
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
the place that they want to exclude
 
00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
themselves from that is
 
00:24:18.149 --> 00:24:18.159 align:start position:0%
recognized and it's recognized further
 
00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:20.600 align:start position:0%
that the best case scenario would be to
 
00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
have the ability to go online exclude
 
00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:28.760 align:start position:0%
yourself from going and to have that
 
00:24:31.549 --> 00:24:31.559 align:start position:0%
information shared with all of our
 
00:24:35.909 --> 00:24:35.919 align:start position:0%
charitable casinos here in New Hampshire
 
00:24:35.919 --> 00:24:38.389 align:start position:0%
charitable casinos here in New Hampshire
yes

00:24:38.389 --> 00:24:38.399 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
is is is there any attempt to put that
 
00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:42.310 align:start position:0%
is is is there any attempt to put that
in

00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:42.320 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:24:44.909 --> 00:24:44.919 align:start position:0%
place certainly we've done research
 
00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
we've spoken with Massachusetts in game
 
00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
sense as well as in the state of Maine
 
00:24:55.269 --> 00:24:55.279 align:start position:0%
Maine 211 has an individual that
 
00:24:57.909 --> 00:24:57.919 align:start position:0%
actually helps people to exclude them
 
00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:00.200 align:start position:0%
themselves from I do believe they have
 
00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
two in the state of Maine two casinos
 
00:25:06.789 --> 00:25:06.799 align:start position:0%
right now right right Bor
 
00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
and the other one Ox o Bango bango's got
 
00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
the slot house right and and just one
 
00:25:17.909 --> 00:25:17.919 align:start position:0%
one further point the 800 number that
 
00:25:20.669 --> 00:25:20.679 align:start position:0%
appears we we we've got some advertising
 
00:25:23.029 --> 00:25:23.039 align:start position:0%
that appears on on television on that
 
00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
800 number that appears right at the end
 
00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
of it who answer was that 800 number
 
00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
that's actually the um the folks at
 
00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:35.720 align:start position:0%
DraftKings I think you're referring to a
 
00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:37.880 align:start position:0%
sports betting right so that that
 
00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:41.480 align:start position:0%
telephone number goes to them okay and I
 
00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:43.880 align:start position:0%
guess the last question it it it turs
 
00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
then of of of the persons identify
 
00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:51.320 align:start position:0%
themselves what what happens after that
 
00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
is there is do they refer them to uh to
 
00:25:57.990 --> 00:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
some kind of uh treatment situation or
 
00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
in speaking with DraftKings um they help
 
00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
to identify specifically what the
 
00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:06.360 align:start position:0%
individual wants if they want their
 
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
account closed if they're looking for
 
00:26:12.029 --> 00:26:12.039 align:start position:0%
assistance yes they work through that
 
00:26:14.669 --> 00:26:14.679 align:start position:0%
with them and identify the reason why
 
00:26:18.149 --> 00:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
they are calling okay thank you yeah
 
00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
Charlie's ell no it's part of the I
 
00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
could um Senator as part of the law
 
00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
allowing sports betting is there was a
 
00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
requirement to have a responsible
 
00:26:30.909 --> 00:26:30.919 align:start position:0%
gambling plan place um and uh drafting
 
00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:32.600 align:start position:0%
specifically has a self-exclusion
 
00:26:36.389 --> 00:26:36.399 align:start position:0%
function on the phone or in your laptop
 
00:26:37.909 --> 00:26:37.919 align:start position:0%
and there are hundreds of hundreds of
 
00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:39.320 align:start position:0%
people who have excluded themselves from
 
00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
DraftKings intentionally okay great
 
00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:43.480 align:start position:0%
that's good thank you thank you very
 
00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
much thank you so I'm G to switch and
 
00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:48.440 align:start position:0%
talk about a little pragmatic and I'm
 
00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
gonna ask you as a as an
 
00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:53.720 align:start position:0%
operator what are the what are the
 
00:26:57.269 --> 00:26:57.279 align:start position:0%
barriers to allow that data sharing to
 
00:26:59.149 --> 00:26:59.159 align:start position:0%
allow for the self- exclusion to be able
 
00:27:03.789 --> 00:27:03.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
organizations uh right now I think most
 
00:27:07.669 --> 00:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
of the rooms would love if it was all in
 
00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:09.720 align:start position:0%
syn and we could all Let each other know
 
00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
it's a little problematic cuz it's
 
00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:13.000 align:start position:0%
private information so they to come in
 
00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
and sign off on it so that we're
 
00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:17.200 align:start position:0%
protecting ourselves against them saying
 
00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:20.200 align:start position:0%
we're biased or it's because I won or
 
00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:23.720 align:start position:0%
who knows so you know we'd love if it
 
00:27:25.149 --> 00:27:25.159 align:start position:0%
was an online form I know there's
 
00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:27.320 align:start position:0%
hurdles and in New Hampshire like you
 
00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:29.720 align:start position:0%
can't save ID information so that's a
 
00:27:31.549 --> 00:27:31.559 align:start position:0%
hurdle so you really have to try to
 
00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:33.480 align:start position:0%
catch them right the door which is part
 
00:27:35.909 --> 00:27:35.919 align:start position:0%
of why we C everybody and then our
 
00:27:37.549 --> 00:27:37.559 align:start position:0%
security team tries to keep each other
 
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
updated on who to look for who
 
00:27:42.509 --> 00:27:42.519 align:start position:0%
self-excluded and so forth so there's
 
00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
definitely some hurdles that would have
 
00:27:46.549 --> 00:27:46.559 align:start position:0%
to be worked out so to make it
 
00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:48.200 align:start position:0%
accessible to all
 
00:27:51.909 --> 00:27:51.919 align:start position:0%
the balance between Charlie and J
 
00:27:53.669 --> 00:27:53.679 align:start position:0%
understand again I'm trying to
 
00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:56.120 align:start position:0%
understand is there a legal U barrier
 
00:27:58.269 --> 00:27:58.279 align:start position:0%
here somewhere in our law that says that
 
00:27:59.509 --> 00:27:59.519 align:start position:0%
you're not allowed to scan that
 
00:28:01.509 --> 00:28:01.519 align:start position:0%
information if we were to enter into a
 
00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
contract with someone like gam sense to
 
00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:05.640 align:start position:0%
be able to share this data are there
 
00:28:08.549 --> 00:28:08.559 align:start position:0%
legal barriers in the way right now that
 
00:28:10.509 --> 00:28:10.519 align:start position:0%
would prohibit the use of that kind of
 
00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:13.880 align:start position:0%
contracting service um I mean certainly
 
00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:16.240 align:start position:0%
I would think at least Hippa would be I
 
00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
would look for the Attorney General's
 
00:28:20.389 --> 00:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
opinion in terms of law but since it is
 
00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
classified of the DSM as a as an
 
00:28:25.149 --> 00:28:25.159 align:start position:0%
addiction it would be health related and
 
00:28:27.149 --> 00:28:27.159 align:start position:0%
sort of it would require I think a
 
00:28:29.149 --> 00:28:29.159 align:start position:0%
change in the law like ideally you would
 
00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:31.360 align:start position:0%
have one central location on our website
 
00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:33.320 align:start position:0%
or their website where you would go and
 
00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
say I wish to be excluded from these
 
00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:38.360 align:start position:0%
things and because we have two platforms
 
00:28:39.789 --> 00:28:39.799 align:start position:0%
that are digital right we have an ey
 
00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
Lottery platform and we have a sports
 
00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
Bank platform both of which have had
 
00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:46.240 align:start position:0%
self exclusion functions and um
 
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
limitations like you can limit yourself
 
00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
$10 a month or whatever uh and so you
 
00:28:52.029 --> 00:28:52.039 align:start position:0%
could have a central portal where you
 
00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
could go and that would be shared with
 
00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:55.960 align:start position:0%
the operators as part of their
 
00:28:57.669 --> 00:28:57.679 align:start position:0%
responsible gambling responsibility is
 
00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
which we also audit so
 
00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
um so hip I don't think would apply
 
00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:05.480 align:start position:0%
because it applies with employers and
 
00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
insurance carriers and providers and not
 
00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily in this situation but um
 
00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:13.480 align:start position:0%
again I'm just concerned is there
 
00:29:17.149 --> 00:29:17.159 align:start position:0%
anything G mentioned the there's some
 
00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:18.440 align:start position:0%
sort of prohibition about scanning and
 
00:29:21.509 --> 00:29:21.519 align:start position:0%
storing data in in law maybe is it is
 
00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
that in the law do we know or is that um
 
00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
are we familiar with any of that not I'm
 
00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:28.600 align:start position:0%
not all right so it doesn't sound like
 
00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:30.360 align:start position:0%
there's a legal barrier to this
 
00:29:32.909 --> 00:29:32.919 align:start position:0%
operation other than maybe a pragmatic
 
00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:35.480 align:start position:0%
barrier a maybe AG can help us out yeah
 
00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:36.760 align:start position:0%
let me let me just ask one one question
 
00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
of G on a pragmatic person again when
 
00:29:41.389 --> 00:29:41.399 align:start position:0%
somebody walks into a gaming operator
 
00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
you take their ID you scan it through
 
00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
one of those scanning devices they use
 
00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
like a TSA and it identifies the person
 
00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
says they're legal it's a valid ID and
 
00:29:51.149 --> 00:29:51.159 align:start position:0%
they're over
 
00:29:55.669 --> 00:29:55.679 align:start position:0%
21 or 18 what they yes that's correct um
 
00:29:58.350 --> 00:29:58.360 align:start position:0%
with that we can't save their ID so it
 
00:30:00.789 --> 00:30:00.799 align:start position:0%
won't like pop up and say they're
 
00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:02.440 align:start position:0%
self-excluded because you can't keep
 
00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
their information is my
 
00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:07.509 align:start position:0%
their information is my
understanding

00:30:07.509 --> 00:30:07.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:07.519 --> 00:30:10.549 align:start position:0%
 
stored

00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:10.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:10.559 --> 00:30:12.549 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:30:12.549 --> 00:30:12.559 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:30:14.669 --> 00:30:14.679 align:start position:0%
John Let's sit up
 
00:30:18.509 --> 00:30:18.519 align:start position:0%
here and U his card is underneath yours
 
00:30:22.789 --> 00:30:22.799 align:start position:0%
Senator so you been your yeah so uh from
 
00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
the AG's P office
 
00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:26.840 align:start position:0%
perspective can something that's
 
00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:28.120 align:start position:0%
something we have to take back as a
 
00:30:29.669 --> 00:30:29.679 align:start position:0%
research project to see whether or not
 
00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
there's any sort of legal impediment uh
 
00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:34.600 align:start position:0%
to scanning and storing that information
 
00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
but if I could make a f if I could make
 
00:30:38.669 --> 00:30:38.679 align:start position:0%
a follow-up question I'm curious as to
 
00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:41.640 align:start position:0%
how the state deals with if at all a
 
00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:45.240 align:start position:0%
band players list so if facilities ban
 
00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
players from their facility is that
 
00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
information shared and is that stored
 
00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:53.240 align:start position:0%
someplace several states do do that
 
00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
Nevada being one of them I I I don't
 
00:30:58.789 --> 00:30:58.799 align:start position:0%
know the answer so that's not a a
 
00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:00.120 align:start position:0%
problem responsible ging problem that's
 
00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
a I don't know the answer to that i'
 
00:31:04.669 --> 00:31:04.679 align:start position:0%
have to check right so Qui follow follow
 
00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
so again so the interesting part is that
 
00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:08.240 align:start position:0%
again someone would have to add
 
00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
voluntarily add themselves to the list
 
00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
and the only thing we would be doing is
 
00:31:14.549 --> 00:31:14.559 align:start position:0%
validating against that list if I'm not
 
00:31:19.149 --> 00:31:19.159 align:start position:0%
mistaken is that is that right so to to
 
00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:21.200 align:start position:0%
G's point about storing and scanning
 
00:31:23.029 --> 00:31:23.039 align:start position:0%
right we're not storing any customer
 
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
data or private data at that point we're
 
00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:27.320 align:start position:0%
taking the ID putting it through comp
 
00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:30.120 align:start position:0%
parent against a known list of people
 
00:31:32.269 --> 00:31:32.279 align:start position:0%
who either this you brought up a new
 
00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
topic of ban but people who have
 
00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:35.960 align:start position:0%
self-excluded and then saying you've
 
00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:38.360 align:start position:0%
already self-excluded at this venue and
 
00:31:40.149 --> 00:31:40.159 align:start position:0%
you're so therefore you're not allowed
 
00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:42.440 align:start position:0%
here at the second venue as well so I'm
 
00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:44.600 align:start position:0%
not sure that we hit the scan and scan
 
00:31:46.990 --> 00:31:47.000 align:start position:0%
and store problem that she's talking
 
00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
about um because the person's
 
00:31:50.549 --> 00:31:50.559 align:start position:0%
voluntarily putting their name into the
 
00:31:52.629 --> 00:31:52.639 align:start position:0%
database but the band is an interesting
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
new wrinkle I hadn't thought about okay
 
00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
well it okay represent
 
00:32:03.149 --> 00:32:03.159 align:start position:0%
Ames just a suggestion it seems to me
 
00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:06.240 align:start position:0%
that we would be uh helped if we could
 
00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
get the Maine and uh
 
00:32:11.549 --> 00:32:11.559 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts uh counterpart
 
00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:14.200 align:start position:0%
organizations some representative in
 
00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:16.120 align:start position:0%
here to speak with us about this yeah
 
00:32:18.669 --> 00:32:18.679 align:start position:0%
can you help us with
 
00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:22.840 align:start position:0%
that so I I think again again what this
 
00:32:23.789 --> 00:32:23.799 align:start position:0%
commission is doing is trying to
 
00:32:26.149 --> 00:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
identify issues that need addressing and
 
00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:29.000 align:start position:0%
it sounds like that this has some
 
00:32:32.149 --> 00:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
addressing that needs to be done uh so
 
00:32:34.549 --> 00:32:34.559 align:start position:0%
that we can recommend changes for the
 
00:32:37.909 --> 00:32:37.919 align:start position:0%
future uh that may require legislation
 
00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:40.600 align:start position:0%
uh but be helpful if the AG could weigh
 
00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
in a little bit if on this issue down
 
00:32:47.549 --> 00:32:47.559 align:start position:0%
the road um so uh thank you very much
 
00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
because it's it's opened our eyes a
 
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
little bit it seems like we yeah we got
 
00:32:53.509 --> 00:32:53.519 align:start position:0%
a program but it it's really got a ways
 
00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
to go um and especially with charel
 
00:32:58.549 --> 00:32:58.559 align:start position:0%
gaming growing the way it is now in the
 
00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
state um I think it's a relevant
 
00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:04.760 align:start position:0%
discussion to have so any other
 
00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
questions very good point Mr chairman
 
00:33:10.629 --> 00:33:10.639 align:start position:0%
the fact of the matter is the expansion
 
00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:13.320 align:start position:0%
with the number the number of entities
 
00:33:16.029 --> 00:33:16.039 align:start position:0%
offering charitable
 
00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
gaming creates a pro creates a problem
 
00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:20.600 align:start position:0%
with surveillance and and with the
 
00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:22.840 align:start position:0%
ability to to
 
00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
uh oversee this activity I mean the L
 
00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
the lottery the
 
00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:30.120 align:start position:0%
commission it's it's your
 
00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
responsibility but when you go from 10
 
00:33:36.149 --> 00:33:36.159 align:start position:0%
to 15 to 20 right you're you're talking
 
00:33:39.029 --> 00:33:39.039 align:start position:0%
about 20 facilities that are that are
 
00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:43.360 align:start position:0%
working almost 24/7 MH at at this point
 
00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
at this point in time and remember when
 
00:33:48.909 --> 00:33:48.919 align:start position:0%
we initiated the lottery it was a sweet
 
00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
Stakes race that happened once a year
 
00:33:54.669 --> 00:33:54.679 align:start position:0%
you bought you bought a ticket for $3
 
00:33:57.710 --> 00:33:57.720 align:start position:0%
you signed your name you gave it back
 
00:34:01.389 --> 00:34:01.399 align:start position:0%
and they had a race at at Rocky Park uh
 
00:34:03.789 --> 00:34:03.799 align:start position:0%
I I think as pointed out by
 
00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
representative Ames Massachusetts and
 
00:34:09.389 --> 00:34:09.399 align:start position:0%
and and and Main they're in the business
 
00:34:10.990 --> 00:34:11.000 align:start position:0%
now they they have a limited number of
 
00:34:12.629 --> 00:34:12.639 align:start position:0%
facilities uh but they're in the
 
00:34:14.349 --> 00:34:14.359 align:start position:0%
business and many of these queries that
 
00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:17.240 align:start position:0%
we've posted at at this point in time
 
00:34:19.109 --> 00:34:19.119 align:start position:0%
had to be addressed by
 
00:34:22.149 --> 00:34:22.159 align:start position:0%
them had to be but it sounds like they
 
00:34:24.629 --> 00:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
have a tech technological solution yeah
 
00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:29.560 align:start position:0%
right that they if if one one presents
 
00:34:31.589 --> 00:34:31.599 align:start position:0%
everybody knows I mean it's not that
 
00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
it's we actually going to have more
 
00:34:35.230 --> 00:34:35.240 align:start position:0%
facilities than they do we they have two
 
00:34:38.430 --> 00:34:38.440 align:start position:0%
or three in these states we have 15
 
00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
right well probably 14 now but let's
 
00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:44.200 align:start position:0%
call it 15 and maybe up to 19 uh per our
 
00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:45.270 align:start position:0%
call it 15 and maybe up to 19 uh per our
last

00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
last
 
00:34:47.589 --> 00:34:47.599 align:start position:0%
discussions uh I mean it does beg for a
 
00:34:49.109 --> 00:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
technological solution I think we have
 
00:34:50.829 --> 00:34:50.839 align:start position:0%
to get over some of these legal barriers
 
00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
of of of whether the data is secure or
 
00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
not secure does it have to be or not uh
 
00:34:58.470 --> 00:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
but I think this something that the
 
00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
committee can take up as as the months
 
00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:00.910 align:start position:0%
committee can take up as as the months
go

00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:00.920 align:start position:0%
go
 
00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:03.480 align:start position:0%
on so again I just ask as a homework
 
00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:05.640 align:start position:0%
assignment if the AG and then and the
 
00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:07.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Council for responsible gaming
 
00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:09.640 align:start position:0%
can take a look at what legislative
 
00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:12.200 align:start position:0%
changes do we need enabling statute to
 
00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
enable this systemwide solution or is
 
00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
the law okay we just need to implement
 
00:35:19.829 --> 00:35:19.839 align:start position:0%
right there's no change needed we just
 
00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:22.200 align:start position:0%
got to do it so I'd be interested in
 
00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:23.960 align:start position:0%
knowing whether what what that barrier
 
00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
is and and so we can act on it
 
00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
accordingly we'll take that back to the
 
00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
shop and and take a look
 
00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:34.200 align:start position:0%
right um Mark you know um I text him
 
00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:36.200 align:start position:0%
John our chief compliance officer is
 
00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:40.040 align:start position:0%
watching this you know um he has a
 
00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
research project on it so he's already
 
00:35:43.630 --> 00:35:43.640 align:start position:0%
done a bunch of work on that yeah yeah
 
00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
so if you want to link with John I I'll
 
00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
touch Bas I don't want to get into it
 
00:35:48.349 --> 00:35:48.359 align:start position:0%
here because it be I don't want to do it
 
00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:50.720 align:start position:0%
via text but yeah there's app he done a
 
00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
bunch of research and you get a head
 
00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:54.520 align:start position:0%
start yeah I'll touch Spas with uh
 
00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
attorne you know what you can do is let
 
00:35:58.630 --> 00:35:58.640 align:start position:0%
let me know when you're ready to uh if
 
00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
it's the next meeting or the meeting
 
00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
after this let me know uh we'll put it
 
00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
we'll put it on the agenda to keep on
 
00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:08.280 align:start position:0%
discussing this so
 
00:36:10.829 --> 00:36:10.839 align:start position:0%
umat thank you Mr chair just just to
 
00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:13.960 align:start position:0%
throw another curveball at this I know
 
00:36:17.589 --> 00:36:17.599 align:start position:0%
we're talking specifically charal gaming
 
00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:19.640 align:start position:0%
but if somebody goes to the extent of
 
00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:21.510 align:start position:0%
but if somebody goes to the extent of
self-exclusion

00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
self-exclusion
 
00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
on uh sports betting for
 
00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:27.640 align:start position:0%
instance why isn't it why don't we
 
00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
explore not only the charal gaming
 
00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
establishments but online Lottery at l i
 
00:36:38.309 --> 00:36:38.319 align:start position:0%
mean if if you think uh I head to the
 
00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
point where you and I find it
 
00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:42.280 align:start position:0%
interesting that DraftKings handles is
 
00:36:44.109 --> 00:36:44.119 align:start position:0%
but that's another component we could
 
00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:46.520 align:start position:0%
talk about but if you're excluding
 
00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
yourself from doing sports betting is
 
00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:51.640 align:start position:0%
there a component that we can exclude
 
00:36:54.069 --> 00:36:54.079 align:start position:0%
from online scratch tickets and Power
 
00:36:56.829 --> 00:36:56.839 align:start position:0%
Ball and and chatable gaming and and on
 
00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
and on is something we may or may not
 
00:37:03.349 --> 00:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
want to look at no um the technology
 
00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
regarding online is very doable uh where
 
00:37:08.829 --> 00:37:08.839 align:start position:0%
it's the physical it's virtually
 
00:37:10.309 --> 00:37:10.319 align:start position:0%
impossible to stop somebody from buying
 
00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:12.640 align:start position:0%
a scratch ticket in a store it' be the
 
00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:13.800 align:start position:0%
equivalent of stopping somebody from buy
 
00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:16.440 align:start position:0%
a cup of coffee quite literally there's
 
00:37:19.589 --> 00:37:19.599 align:start position:0%
1500 locations yeah across the state it
 
00:37:22.589 --> 00:37:22.599 align:start position:0%
would be it would be not feasible but we
 
00:37:25.150 --> 00:37:25.160 align:start position:0%
do have a program where we do our sales
 
00:37:27.430 --> 00:37:27.440 align:start position:0%
if do talk to Clerks and do try and
 
00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:29.640 align:start position:0%
train the clerks which is difficult
 
00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:31.560 align:start position:0%
because the average term of employment
 
00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
for a clerk in a sea store I think it's
 
00:37:36.829 --> 00:37:36.839 align:start position:0%
like 67 days employment so they
 
00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
constantly churning employees it's
 
00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:42.200 align:start position:0%
difficult right so okay these are all
 
00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:44.200 align:start position:0%
good comments just just refresh my
 
00:37:46.589 --> 00:37:46.599 align:start position:0%
memory when we did historic racing
 
00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
didn't we each facility was supposed to
 
00:37:49.790 --> 00:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
have a
 
00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
plan to monitor MH so the facilities
 
00:37:55.829 --> 00:37:55.839 align:start position:0%
also have the ability to say tap
 
00:37:59.109 --> 00:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
somebody on the shoulder and say Hey you
 
00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
know we think you're you're exceeding
 
00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:02.480 align:start position:0%
your as farther application they're
 
00:38:05.309 --> 00:38:05.319 align:start position:0%
required to submit to uh to us their
 
00:38:07.150 --> 00:38:07.160 align:start position:0%
responsible gambling plan and then we've
 
00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:09.160 align:start position:0%
audited that as of I think I mentioned
 
00:38:11.069 --> 00:38:11.079 align:start position:0%
it before I think four and a half months
 
00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
ago uh every room was confirmed and
 
00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:17.880 align:start position:0%
complied with their plane
 
00:38:20.270 --> 00:38:20.280 align:start position:0%
okay are they identifying problem
 
00:38:24.349 --> 00:38:24.359 align:start position:0%
gamblers you know what I mean through
 
00:38:27.309 --> 00:38:27.319 align:start position:0%
that but have to check okay
 
00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious about that I think
 
00:38:29.950 --> 00:38:29.960 align:start position:0%
that's part of the larger discussion as
 
00:38:33.069 --> 00:38:33.079 align:start position:0%
well so there was a plan they have the
 
00:38:37.109 --> 00:38:37.119 align:start position:0%
plan right but it's it's a plan being
 
00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:40.640 align:start position:0%
followed you know yeah so okay great all
 
00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
right well thank you very much um Mora
 
00:38:46.069 --> 00:38:46.079 align:start position:0%
apprciate you the time
 
00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
okay so next topic is you know whether
 
00:38:54.030 --> 00:38:54.040 align:start position:0%
or not we put a cap on the number of
 
00:38:57.790 --> 00:38:57.800 align:start position:0%
facilities uh or not that's all the I
 
00:38:59.950 --> 00:38:59.960 align:start position:0%
know this's legislation rolling too at
 
00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
this point in time about that um but the
 
00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
one thing that charal gaming never had
 
00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
an opt-in or an opt out like Lottery it
 
00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
was an opt opt in right um and and we
 
00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
did Kino was an opt in like you can't
 
00:39:25.829 --> 00:39:25.839 align:start position:0%
get pchm opt in right on the Kino so
 
00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:27.800 align:start position:0%
even though they ERS that or restaurants
 
00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
that would like to see it so uh so I
 
00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
know when we were doing historic racing
 
00:39:37.069 --> 00:39:37.079 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of pressure on me to say
 
00:39:39.069 --> 00:39:39.079 align:start position:0%
wow why don't why don't we have an opt
 
00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:41.400 align:start position:0%
in on how ST racing and my response was
 
00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
well we're talking about the facility
 
00:39:44.309 --> 00:39:44.319 align:start position:0%
not the specific games that are being
 
00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:46.040 align:start position:0%
played in the
 
00:39:49.829 --> 00:39:49.839 align:start position:0%
facility uh that should be regulated so
 
00:39:49.839 --> 00:39:51.150 align:start position:0%
facility uh that should be regulated so
now

00:39:51.150 --> 00:39:51.160 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:39:53.109 --> 00:39:53.119 align:start position:0%
obviously in this discussion I don't
 
00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
want any facility to get nervous because
 
00:39:57.910 --> 00:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
we we're not going to
 
00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
retroactively say your your city has to
 
00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:03.720 align:start position:0%
opt in if you're already existed you you
 
00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
you've invested millions of dollars and
 
00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
you can't you can't reverse it so we're
 
00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
talking about new communities I think we
 
00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:13.400 align:start position:0%
should have this conversation uh maybe
 
00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
uh but I'll leave it at that and Deb uh
 
00:40:22.910 --> 00:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
Warner um was is is involved in a
 
00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:24.800 align:start position:0%
specific town and she she has some few
 
00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
things she want us wants us to kind of
 
00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
lead our discussion in way about the
 
00:40:32.069 --> 00:40:32.079 align:start position:0%
situation you've got
 
00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:52.990 --> 00:40:53.000 align:start position:0%
yep hello I'm Dr Deborah Warner from
 
00:40:56.069 --> 00:40:56.079 align:start position:0%
Littleton I am very happy to be invited
 
00:40:58.990 --> 00:40:59.000 align:start position:0%
to your table to share the experiences
 
00:41:01.309 --> 00:41:01.319 align:start position:0%
that we've recently gone through uh
 
00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:04.200 align:start position:0%
regarding the charitable uh gaming and
 
00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
the historic horse racing um I'll start
 
00:41:11.069 --> 00:41:11.079 align:start position:0%
with last may we had an organization
 
00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
come to town that wanted to put in a
 
00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:17.720 align:start position:0%
casino where the staple store is on The
 
00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:20.680 align:start position:0%
Meadows our town is 6,000 people but we
 
00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
are a very um we're a magnet for
 
00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
Commerce in the North Country I think if
 
00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:28.040 align:start position:0%
you know about Littleton you know how
 
00:41:30.030 --> 00:41:30.040 align:start position:0%
very proud We Are of Littleton and how
 
00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:33.440 align:start position:0%
much we love it um we're listed in the
 
00:41:36.349 --> 00:41:36.359 align:start position:0%
top 10 places to live in the country so
 
00:41:37.870 --> 00:41:37.880 align:start position:0%
you feel like candy that's the place to
 
00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:40.720 align:start position:0%
go that counter it's great we don't have
 
00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
the world's longest counter they
 
00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
ever we don't have an empty store on
 
00:41:46.990 --> 00:41:47.000 align:start position:0%
Main Street we have a good um
 
00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
development in The Meadows as well um so
 
00:41:53.069 --> 00:41:53.079 align:start position:0%
last May an organization came through
 
00:41:54.829 --> 00:41:54.839 align:start position:0%
that wanted to do this where was an a
 
00:41:57.470 --> 00:41:57.480 align:start position:0%
listening session at the high school
 
00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
more than a hundred people came in May
 
00:42:04.829 --> 00:42:04.839 align:start position:0%
which was a lot of people 95 people from
 
00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
Littleton got up and spoke against
 
00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
having a casino come to Littleton five
 
00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:12.640 align:start position:0%
people got up and said they were in
 
00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:16.680 align:start position:0%
favor of it um it created quite a stir
 
00:42:20.069 --> 00:42:20.079 align:start position:0%
locally and um quite a few of us got
 
00:42:21.870 --> 00:42:21.880 align:start position:0%
together and talked about it and saw
 
00:42:23.950 --> 00:42:23.960 align:start position:0%
well what can we do um there was very
 
00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:26.440 align:start position:0%
very little seemed that we could do um
 
00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
but when we did Research into the
 
00:42:30.990 --> 00:42:31.000 align:start position:0%
statutes and looked at the bills um
 
00:42:34.549 --> 00:42:34.559 align:start position:0%
House Bill 626 in 2021 and looked at the
 
00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
reports that were coming out of
 
00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
committee it did say that we could
 
00:42:41.349 --> 00:42:41.359 align:start position:0%
control it by ordinance and so we
 
00:42:44.670 --> 00:42:44.680 align:start position:0%
decided to put forward an ordinance um
 
00:42:47.309 --> 00:42:47.319 align:start position:0%
proposition well this did not go over
 
00:42:50.670 --> 00:42:50.680 align:start position:0%
very well at all um the problem with
 
00:42:52.510 --> 00:42:52.520 align:start position:0%
this was when we got to the planning
 
00:42:55.870 --> 00:42:55.880 align:start position:0%
board and presented our petition there
 
00:42:59.230 --> 00:42:59.240 align:start position:0%
was the problem with the Dylan law U
 
00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:01.800 align:start position:0%
Dylan rule the preemption of the state
 
00:43:05.589 --> 00:43:05.599 align:start position:0%
over the local Authority and uh so we
 
00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
couldn't do what we had hoped to do
 
00:43:11.069 --> 00:43:11.079 align:start position:0%
which was to say not here and so um
 
00:43:12.750 --> 00:43:12.760 align:start position:0%
we're sort of in a Sticky Wicket with
 
00:43:15.670 --> 00:43:15.680 align:start position:0%
that at the moment besides that there
 
00:43:19.710 --> 00:43:19.720 align:start position:0%
was the dread and panic on the board as
 
00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:22.880 align:start position:0%
they heard our proposition is that just
 
00:43:26.430 --> 00:43:26.440 align:start position:0%
a few weeks ago Conway had gotten sued
 
00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
and if you read in the paper I I didn't
 
00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
talk to them but I did read the accounts
 
00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
in the paper and the report from the
 
00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
industrial um consultant said that well
 
00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
it's not that Conway has denied us or
 
00:43:43.990 --> 00:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
done something wrong or against us we're
 
00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:46.880 align:start position:0%
just putting in the lawsuit to hold the
 
00:43:48.750 --> 00:43:48.760 align:start position:0%
docket open for
 
00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:52.480 align:start position:0%
ourselves and so that really alarmed the
 
00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
Littleton planning board and so we're
 
00:43:57.910 --> 00:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
we're in rather a difficult position as
 
00:44:00.829 --> 00:44:00.839 align:start position:0%
would be any of the over 200 towns in
 
00:44:04.750 --> 00:44:04.760 align:start position:0%
our state in that with State preemption
 
00:44:09.109 --> 00:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
we can't say no and with um
 
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
the the industry coming in and doing
 
00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:16.440 align:start position:0%
preemptive lawsuits it scares the boards
 
00:44:18.109 --> 00:44:18.119 align:start position:0%
the planning boards quite a bit we are
 
00:44:21.030 --> 00:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
in a pickle and so you know we're coming
 
00:44:23.069 --> 00:44:23.079 align:start position:0%
up on the town meeting and all that sort
 
00:44:25.390 --> 00:44:25.400 align:start position:0%
of thing we're in sb2 town uh so we have
 
00:44:28.030 --> 00:44:28.040 align:start position:0%
the deliberative session I cannot tell
 
00:44:31.390 --> 00:44:31.400 align:start position:0%
you what will happen with all of that um
 
00:44:33.150 --> 00:44:33.160 align:start position:0%
it's it's quite difficult and I think
 
00:44:36.430 --> 00:44:36.440 align:start position:0%
that the conversations that came out
 
00:44:40.870 --> 00:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
locally um as we were going through our
 
00:44:44.470 --> 00:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
recent and current mess with this is
 
00:44:46.030 --> 00:44:46.040 align:start position:0%
that a local option would be the
 
00:44:48.790 --> 00:44:48.800 align:start position:0%
cleanest way to handle this if it's at
 
00:44:51.390 --> 00:44:51.400 align:start position:0%
the state level because then the town
 
00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
simply has to vote one way or another
 
00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:56.240 align:start position:0%
and they can't be sued for having a vote
 
00:44:58.950 --> 00:44:58.960 align:start position:0%
but they SE can be sued easily if they
 
00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
have an ordinance and you have to defend
 
00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
it and so um it was generally concluded
 
00:45:07.630 --> 00:45:07.640 align:start position:0%
that that would be the most wise thing
 
00:45:10.910 --> 00:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
to do um on behalf of all the towns so
 
00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
that they could say yes or no and there
 
00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
are many towns I believe would say yes
 
00:45:18.750 --> 00:45:18.760 align:start position:0%
but there are towns that might say no as
 
00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
it seems Littleton might say no we don't
 
00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:23.160 align:start position:0%
know how the vote would go um but that's
 
00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
our predicament and I really thank you
 
00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
for the opportunity to bring it to your
 
00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
attention because I think it's shared
 
00:45:32.349 --> 00:45:32.359 align:start position:0%
across the state in any town that might
 
00:45:35.430 --> 00:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
want to do this and um it's it's not
 
00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
basically a fair race in the end between
 
00:45:43.390 --> 00:45:43.400 align:start position:0%
the town and the um guest so let me
 
00:45:46.069 --> 00:45:46.079 align:start position:0%
there's two two ways of looking at this
 
00:45:46.079 --> 00:45:47.349 align:start position:0%
there's two two ways of looking at this
first

00:45:47.349 --> 00:45:47.359 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
is uh anord that says no no casinos ever
 
00:45:56.010 --> 00:45:56.020 align:start position:0%
okay and then there's Z
 
00:45:56.020 --> 00:45:57.670 align:start position:0%
okay and then there's Z
[Music]

00:45:57.670 --> 00:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
where you say you know casinos can be
 
00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
only on this part of the town okay so it
 
00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
sounds like you're you're pursuing to
 
00:46:13.349 --> 00:46:13.359 align:start position:0%
no we know we know of communities that
 
00:46:15.670 --> 00:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
have successfully
 
00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
zoned you wanted to explain Salem uh I
 
00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:23.680 align:start position:0%
mean they're very very successfully
 
00:46:27.109 --> 00:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
zoned it's not saying no it's saying
 
00:46:29.589 --> 00:46:29.599 align:start position:0%
not here in this neighborhood right not
 
00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
next to the school not next to the
 
00:46:34.309 --> 00:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
whatever I'm looking at you because I
 
00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:36.400 align:start position:0%
know Salem has has done that yeah simply
 
00:46:39.710 --> 00:46:39.720 align:start position:0%
and and thank you for I'm sorry quick
 
00:46:42.549 --> 00:46:42.559 align:start position:0%
question I'm sorry I'm still horse who
 
00:46:45.109 --> 00:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
are you representing here who am I
 
00:46:48.030 --> 00:46:48.040 align:start position:0%
representing are you a band of citizens
 
00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
a band of citizens okay we have no real
 
00:46:51.950 --> 00:46:51.960 align:start position:0%
name you said we many times and I was
 
00:46:54.870 --> 00:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
unaware as to who what we've done in
 
00:46:58.030 --> 00:46:58.040 align:start position:0%
Salem is exactly that is is Zone
 
00:46:58.040 --> 00:46:59.190 align:start position:0%
Salem is exactly that is is Zone
specific

00:46:59.190 --> 00:46:59.200 align:start position:0%
specific
 
00:47:03.150 --> 00:47:03.160 align:start position:0%
locations that as much as there's a huge
 
00:47:06.109 --> 00:47:06.119 align:start position:0%
interest and plenty of property and
 
00:47:08.589 --> 00:47:08.599 align:start position:0%
plenty of space for for uh these
 
00:47:11.829 --> 00:47:11.839 align:start position:0%
facilities or future facilities to go
 
00:47:14.190 --> 00:47:14.200 align:start position:0%
that the town fathers the people we put
 
00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
in place at the local level to control
 
00:47:20.430 --> 00:47:20.440 align:start position:0%
Our Town took care of it so that that
 
00:47:22.870 --> 00:47:22.880 align:start position:0%
would be my suggestion it worked great
 
00:47:25.309 --> 00:47:25.319 align:start position:0%
for for a a bigger town like Salem a
 
00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
border town that we get a lot of
 
00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:30.200 align:start position:0%
incoming in relation to terrible gaming
 
00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:31.710 align:start position:0%
incoming in relation to terrible gaming
and

00:47:31.710 --> 00:47:31.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:47:36.349 --> 00:47:36.359 align:start position:0%
yes I I am I understand uh Salem's needs
 
00:47:38.349 --> 00:47:38.359 align:start position:0%
may be very different than littleton's
 
00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
you had a rist track there you you have
 
00:47:43.589 --> 00:47:43.599 align:start position:0%
a different culture um it's part of the
 
00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:47.400 align:start position:0%
charm of Salem and and yet it's
 
00:47:49.549 --> 00:47:49.559 align:start position:0%
littleton's not seeing it as
 
00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
Charming anywhere in town just follow up
 
00:47:55.309 --> 00:47:55.319 align:start position:0%
yeah follow and I think what you you're
 
00:47:57.870 --> 00:47:57.880 align:start position:0%
looking for here is an opt-in kind of
 
00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:00.680 align:start position:0%
option yes and that's something you
 
00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
should speak directly to somebody
 
00:48:05.589 --> 00:48:05.599 align:start position:0%
somebody could bring that at any time to
 
00:48:08.190 --> 00:48:08.200 align:start position:0%
either side of the wall either body here
 
00:48:10.829 --> 00:48:10.839 align:start position:0%
and it can be examined so something that
 
00:48:12.670 --> 00:48:12.680 align:start position:0%
can be examined it was said to us by
 
00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:14.720 align:start position:0%
various attorney type people that that
 
00:48:16.430 --> 00:48:16.440 align:start position:0%
would be the cleanest option for the
 
00:48:21.549 --> 00:48:21.559 align:start position:0%
little town to have op op in the only
 
00:48:25.790 --> 00:48:25.800 align:start position:0%
you go uh the the only curveball is we
 
00:48:27.790 --> 00:48:27.800 align:start position:0%
don't know if Littleton is one of the
 
00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:29.190 align:start position:0%
don't know if Littleton is one of the
towns

00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:29.200 align:start position:0%
towns
 
00:48:32.430 --> 00:48:32.440 align:start position:0%
that's um while it sounds like they are
 
00:48:35.069 --> 00:48:35.079 align:start position:0%
considering it right because the
 
00:48:37.309 --> 00:48:37.319 align:start position:0%
proposal has been brought forth now
 
00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:40.640 align:start position:0%
whether or not that would be kosher to
 
00:48:43.349 --> 00:48:43.359 align:start position:0%
say opt in or opt out when they're
 
00:48:45.630 --> 00:48:45.640 align:start position:0%
already in the pipeline that's another
 
00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:48.160 align:start position:0%
thing that you know you got to be
 
00:48:51.190 --> 00:48:51.200 align:start position:0%
careful of um you know we could pass a
 
00:48:55.150 --> 00:48:55.160 align:start position:0%
law that says opt in or opt out uh but
 
00:48:56.470 --> 00:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
if there were already in the pipeline
 
00:48:58.190 --> 00:48:58.200 align:start position:0%
being considered for an application I'm
 
00:49:01.470 --> 00:49:01.480 align:start position:0%
not sure that that you know they're
 
00:49:02.829 --> 00:49:02.839 align:start position:0%
already in the pipeline that that would
 
00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:05.200 align:start position:0%
be applied so that's the only concern I
 
00:49:06.510 --> 00:49:06.520 align:start position:0%
got but
 
00:49:10.069 --> 00:49:10.079 align:start position:0%
U thank you so again putting on my other
 
00:49:11.870 --> 00:49:11.880 align:start position:0%
hat I was a zoning board chair for a
 
00:49:14.510 --> 00:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
decade so again under I think you and I
 
00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
traded some emails as well a while back
 
00:49:20.670 --> 00:49:20.680 align:start position:0%
um there are I'm always it's an
 
00:49:22.990 --> 00:49:23.000 align:start position:0%
announcement to me to to start Banning
 
00:49:25.109 --> 00:49:25.119 align:start position:0%
individual type of businesses from
 
00:49:25.119 --> 00:49:26.309 align:start position:0%
individual type of businesses from
community

00:49:26.309 --> 00:49:26.319 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:49:27.829 --> 00:49:27.839 align:start position:0%
at the state level and say unless they
 
00:49:30.030 --> 00:49:30.040 align:start position:0%
choose to opt in Imagine a community
 
00:49:31.230 --> 00:49:31.240 align:start position:0%
that decides it wants to be
 
00:49:32.910 --> 00:49:32.920 align:start position:0%
environmentally conscious and bans all
 
00:49:35.870 --> 00:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
gas stations right and and and and that
 
00:49:37.789 --> 00:49:37.799 align:start position:0%
kind of thing right so it can lead to a
 
00:49:40.430 --> 00:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
really bad path I think the zoning laws

were were designed such under RSA uh
 
00:49:46.750 --> 00:49:46.760 align:start position:0%

00:49:49.069 --> 00:49:49.079 align:start position:0%

00:50:04.390 --> 00:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
all these other kind of things proper
 
00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:06.720 align:start position:0%
use of Natural Resources there are lots
 
00:50:10.470 --> 00:50:10.480 align:start position:0%
of things that towns can use to to Zone
 
00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
to where you want but I I I tend to be
 
00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
really you know the idea that we're
 
00:50:17.670 --> 00:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
going to start earmarking certain types
 
00:50:20.270 --> 00:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
of businesses for exclusion in
 
00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:22.640 align:start position:0%
communities unless they agree to it um
 
00:50:26.470 --> 00:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
as a state policy for all towns adopt is
 
00:50:28.030 --> 00:50:28.040 align:start position:0%
is a little rough for me to swallow
 
00:50:31.150 --> 00:50:31.160 align:start position:0%
anyway um for that reason um but I do
 
00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
think you have a plethora of zoning
 
00:50:36.789 --> 00:50:36.799 align:start position:0%
things you could do that are legitimate
 
00:50:39.430 --> 00:50:39.440 align:start position:0%
and in statute to earmark where you want
 
00:50:40.829 --> 00:50:40.839 align:start position:0%
to be able to put these kind of
 
00:50:43.589 --> 00:50:43.599 align:start position:0%
facilities and and distances from
 
00:50:45.910 --> 00:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
schools and churches and we do that with
 
00:50:48.589 --> 00:50:48.599 align:start position:0%
state liquor stores we do it with with
 
00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
um with vape stores we do it with
 
00:50:53.470 --> 00:50:53.480 align:start position:0%
cannabis um dispensary stores to say
 
00:50:55.390 --> 00:50:55.400 align:start position:0%
that you can set a distance from certain
 
00:50:57.789 --> 00:50:57.799 align:start position:0%
C types of activities like schools where
 
00:50:59.789 --> 00:50:59.799 align:start position:0%
these can go and and you have supporting
 
00:51:01.950 --> 00:51:01.960 align:start position:0%
structure within statute I'm not a big
 
00:51:03.789 --> 00:51:03.799 align:start position:0%
believer I had to add that to my sports
 
00:51:06.430 --> 00:51:06.440 align:start position:0%
betting Bill back in 2019 when I passed
 
00:51:08.589 --> 00:51:08.599 align:start position:0%
that law I hated it when I added it but
 
00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:09.480 align:start position:0%
it was the only way I was going to get
 
00:51:11.470 --> 00:51:11.480 align:start position:0%
the bill through was to add a local
 
00:51:13.510 --> 00:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
provision to it and so I accepted it and
 
00:51:15.789 --> 00:51:15.799 align:start position:0%
swallowed it so that I could make so
 
00:51:18.510 --> 00:51:18.520 align:start position:0%
that the bill would pass and allow for
 
00:51:20.190 --> 00:51:20.200 align:start position:0%
um people to be able to if they choose
 
00:51:21.829 --> 00:51:21.839 align:start position:0%
to bet on sports games here in New
 
00:51:24.910 --> 00:51:24.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um but I I would highly
 
00:51:27.069 --> 00:51:27.079 align:start position:0%
suggest you look at your zoning or the
 
00:51:29.589 --> 00:51:29.599 align:start position:0%
zoning law in New Hampshire under under
 
00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
um 674 17 and see all the conditions and
 
00:51:35.910 --> 00:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
terms you can put around regulating that
 
00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:38.640 align:start position:0%
and using that rather than Banning an
 
00:51:42.030 --> 00:51:42.040 align:start position:0%
individual uh type of um activity
 
00:51:45.309 --> 00:51:45.319 align:start position:0%
although Al may I go yeah respond please
 
00:51:48.309 --> 00:51:48.319 align:start position:0%
yes um well this this industry has
 
00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
already been segmented there's an entire
 
00:51:54.549 --> 00:51:54.559 align:start position:0%
Commission on it and there is um it's
 
00:51:56.430 --> 00:51:56.440 align:start position:0%
it's not just like like diesel engine
 
00:51:59.670 --> 00:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
repair or something like that I I think
 
00:52:01.150 --> 00:52:01.160 align:start position:0%
you know the commission knows that it's
 
00:52:03.309 --> 00:52:03.319 align:start position:0%
controversial it's a very specialized
 
00:52:05.710 --> 00:52:05.720 align:start position:0%
industry it is an industry that's highly
 
00:52:09.109 --> 00:52:09.119 align:start position:0%
associated with addiction and that those
 
00:52:11.589 --> 00:52:11.599 align:start position:0%
are the features that do make it
 
00:52:13.950 --> 00:52:13.960 align:start position:0%
controversial uh in terms of the local
 
00:52:17.230 --> 00:52:17.240 align:start position:0%
level and so although you were not happy
 
00:52:21.829 --> 00:52:21.839 align:start position:0%
with the The Kino um op in um we're
 
00:52:24.870 --> 00:52:24.880 align:start position:0%
delighted with with that option because
 
00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
it does help the local authorities have
 
00:52:31.030 --> 00:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
some authority over this
 
00:52:34.710 --> 00:52:34.720 align:start position:0%
in a measure that they can actually take
 
00:52:36.549 --> 00:52:36.559 align:start position:0%
so thank you thank you for having done
 
00:52:38.670 --> 00:52:38.680 align:start position:0%
that even if you didn't like doing it
 
00:52:40.789 --> 00:52:40.799 align:start position:0%
thank you well I did the same thing with
 
00:52:46.510 --> 00:52:46.520 align:start position:0%
Kino so um and actually Lottery was opin
 
00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
for communities and Charlie just left
 
00:52:50.910 --> 00:52:50.920 align:start position:0%
but I remember his famous story is that
 
00:52:54.069 --> 00:52:54.079 align:start position:0%
Lottery's you know decades old now right
 
00:52:56.069 --> 00:52:56.079 align:start position:0%
but um some of the smaller towns didn't
 
00:52:57.390 --> 00:52:57.400 align:start position:0%
even have a convenience store or
 
00:53:00.150 --> 00:53:00.160 align:start position:0%
anything so fast for 10 years the town
 
00:53:03.150 --> 00:53:03.160 align:start position:0%
gets a convenience store they they apply
 
00:53:06.309 --> 00:53:06.319 align:start position:0%
for uh uh to be able to do get they
 
00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
wanted lottery in their store you know
 
00:53:11.430 --> 00:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
trash tickets or whatever and then all
 
00:53:13.510 --> 00:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
of a sudden they discovered wait a
 
00:53:14.829 --> 00:53:14.839 align:start position:0%
minute the vote the town didn't take a
 
00:53:16.990 --> 00:53:17.000 align:start position:0%
vote because everybody forgot Lottery
 
00:53:18.349 --> 00:53:18.359 align:start position:0%
forgot everybody forgot that that was an
 
00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
op in um but I think it seems like all
 
00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
of gambling whatever I think the only
 
00:53:27.549 --> 00:53:27.559 align:start position:0%
the only exception is is historic uh is
 
00:53:31.069 --> 00:53:31.079 align:start position:0%
Char gaming that that there isn't some
 
00:53:33.230 --> 00:53:33.240 align:start position:0%
kind of an op in
 
00:53:36.190 --> 00:53:36.200 align:start position:0%
provision uh so we understand what
 
00:53:39.549 --> 00:53:39.559 align:start position:0%
you're saying okay the question becomes
 
00:53:42.750 --> 00:53:42.760 align:start position:0%
is it you know is it and it was never
 
00:53:44.910 --> 00:53:44.920 align:start position:0%
one again never one for charal gaming
 
00:53:46.910 --> 00:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
just it just evolved charal Gaming's
 
00:53:49.789 --> 00:53:49.799 align:start position:0%
just evolved over the years and and I
 
00:53:52.109 --> 00:53:52.119 align:start position:0%
was on w means for for 10 year 12 years
 
00:53:54.190 --> 00:53:54.200 align:start position:0%
and we never we never really talked
 
00:53:56.470 --> 00:53:56.480 align:start position:0%
about this other than when historic
 
00:53:59.270 --> 00:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
racing came and I said well you know
 
00:54:01.190 --> 00:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
yeah we need to we need to address it in
 
00:54:04.030 --> 00:54:04.040 align:start position:0%
relation to chable gaming not just a s
 
00:54:09.349 --> 00:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
racing so uh but I think it is something
 
00:54:11.549 --> 00:54:11.559 align:start position:0%
that as a as a commission we should we
 
00:54:14.510 --> 00:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
should continue to discuss
 
00:54:17.870 --> 00:54:17.880 align:start position:0%
um but again OD are the legislature may
 
00:54:20.510 --> 00:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
take it up sooner that you're urging I
 
00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
just don't know if you're if Littleton
 
00:54:25.829 --> 00:54:25.839 align:start position:0%
would be grandfathered in or not I'm
 
00:54:28.309 --> 00:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
saying um and I I'm not a lawyer so I
 
00:54:30.549 --> 00:54:30.559 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
00:54:34.270 --> 00:54:34.280 align:start position:0%
um if I look at you Charlie I mean if if
 
00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
someone's in the
 
00:54:38.589 --> 00:54:38.599 align:start position:0%
pipeline and we create a new law you
 
00:54:41.870 --> 00:54:41.880 align:start position:0%
know we we look retroactively to to us
 
00:54:42.950 --> 00:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
are they
 
00:54:46.710 --> 00:54:46.720 align:start position:0%
still uh you know part of the Old Law
 
00:54:48.630 --> 00:54:48.640 align:start position:0%
not the new law is that something we
 
00:54:50.870 --> 00:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
should maybe I should look at the a offo
 
00:54:53.430 --> 00:54:53.440 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean we're the executive branch I
 
00:54:55.510 --> 00:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
just sort of execute laws pass well
 
00:54:58.309 --> 00:54:58.319 align:start position:0%
that's another one put on
 
00:55:01.789 --> 00:55:01.799 align:start position:0%
so it would be an issue if they passed
 
00:55:03.349 --> 00:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
the zoning ordinance and there was an
 
00:55:05.510 --> 00:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
application pending because this is an
 
00:55:08.549 --> 00:55:08.559 align:start position:0%
area of charitable gambling that enjoys
 
00:55:10.470 --> 00:55:10.480 align:start position:0%
uh field preemption that means that the
 
00:55:13.270 --> 00:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
state has essentially decided to
 
00:55:15.990 --> 00:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
regulate in this field and has left to
 
00:55:18.190 --> 00:55:18.200 align:start position:0%
the towns just their local Planning and
 
00:55:20.470 --> 00:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
Zoning kinds of things and that deals
 
00:55:23.069 --> 00:55:23.079 align:start position:0%
mainly with snow removal trash lighting
 
00:55:25.390 --> 00:55:25.400 align:start position:0%
parking those kinds of things whereas
 
00:55:28.109 --> 00:55:28.119 align:start position:0%
the state has made a determination that
 
00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh through the legislature that it's
 
00:55:32.309 --> 00:55:32.319 align:start position:0%
going to uh regulate the field of
 
00:55:36.589 --> 00:55:36.599 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming uh so uh similar to uh
 
00:55:38.309 --> 00:55:38.319 align:start position:0%
some moratoriums that have happened in
 
00:55:40.630 --> 00:55:40.640 align:start position:0%
the past in the waste industry it
 
00:55:45.630 --> 00:55:45.640 align:start position:0%
wouldn't per se be um an issue if the
 
00:55:47.789 --> 00:55:47.799 align:start position:0%
legislature decided to make a statutory
 
00:55:50.190 --> 00:55:50.200 align:start position:0%
change and that was pending be an issue
 
00:55:52.630 --> 00:55:52.640 align:start position:0%
though if uh they were in the Planning
 
00:55:54.309 --> 00:55:54.319 align:start position:0%
and Zoning Pipeline and they passed an
 
00:55:57.150 --> 00:55:57.160 align:start position:0%
ordinance they would be um they'd be
 
00:55:59.829 --> 00:55:59.839 align:start position:0%
exempt now if they get a license that's
 
00:56:01.349 --> 00:56:01.359 align:start position:0%
a different situation but if they're
 
00:56:04.349 --> 00:56:04.359 align:start position:0%
just in the process um there are plenty
 
00:56:06.710 --> 00:56:06.720 align:start position:0%
of uh examples in New Hampshire law
 
00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
where things were ongoing and the
 
00:56:10.109 --> 00:56:10.119 align:start position:0%
legislature may have passed a moratorium
 
00:56:11.910 --> 00:56:11.920 align:start position:0%
for instance and that put everything on
 
00:56:14.549 --> 00:56:14.559 align:start position:0%
hold for a time okay some of those
 
00:56:16.470 --> 00:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
moratoriums never were lifted either
 
00:56:17.670 --> 00:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for
 
00:56:21.390 --> 00:56:21.400 align:start position:0%
that Senator thank you Mr CH M Mr chman
 
00:56:22.510 --> 00:56:22.520 align:start position:0%
I think the
 
00:56:25.750 --> 00:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
conversation really sent us around
 
00:56:29.630 --> 00:56:29.640 align:start position:0%
eration and proliferation has become a
 
00:56:32.510 --> 00:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
significant issue here where where in
 
00:56:35.150 --> 00:56:35.160 align:start position:0%
the past there there weren't any rules
 
00:56:37.390 --> 00:56:37.400 align:start position:0%
or regulations really that governed this
 
00:56:42.270 --> 00:56:42.280 align:start position:0%
entity it sprang up and all of a sudden
 
00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
proliferation became the issue and the
 
00:56:47.470 --> 00:56:47.480 align:start position:0%
number of licenses granted by The
 
00:56:50.150 --> 00:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
Lottery Commission I mean there was no
 
00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
restriction uh you took a you took a an
 
00:56:56.069 --> 00:56:56.079 align:start position:0%
application made a decision on the
 
00:56:58.829 --> 00:56:58.839 align:start position:0%
application there wasn't any statutory
 
00:57:01.309 --> 00:57:01.319 align:start position:0%
uh language that said you you couldn't
 
00:57:03.950 --> 00:57:03.960 align:start position:0%
do that now I acate this to the old
 
00:57:06.710 --> 00:57:06.720 align:start position:0%
Bingo when Bingo was in every Church
 
00:57:10.069 --> 00:57:10.079 align:start position:0%
Hall in New Hampshire and the priest
 
00:57:12.630 --> 00:57:12.640 align:start position:0%
would get up Catholic church and would
 
00:57:15.349 --> 00:57:15.359 align:start position:0%
say on Tuesday night team number two
 
00:57:18.190 --> 00:57:18.200 align:start position:0%
will conduct the games and they'll be
 
00:57:21.150 --> 00:57:21.160 align:start position:0%
downstairs in the church and we'll have
 
00:57:24.990 --> 00:57:25.000 align:start position:0%
we'll have Bingo and that Bingo was was
 
00:57:27.990 --> 00:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh was given another entity and that was
 
00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
a little scratch ticket called The Lucky
 
00:57:33.390 --> 00:57:33.400 align:start position:0%
Seven called the pull tab and they were
 
00:57:36.950 --> 00:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
25 cents and all of a sudden we started
 
00:57:41.230 --> 00:57:41.240 align:start position:0%
to Reg in 1973 we regulated pull tabs we
 
00:57:44.109 --> 00:57:44.119 align:start position:0%
said it would cost $15 a deal there's a
 
00:57:47.150 --> 00:57:47.160 align:start position:0%
tax on it so forth so that's the first
 
00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
regulation that I know of that that
 
00:57:52.069 --> 00:57:52.079 align:start position:0%
appeared having having to do with with
 
00:57:55.870 --> 00:57:55.880 align:start position:0%
aing but I I think the scope of this
 
00:57:59.470 --> 00:57:59.480 align:start position:0%
committee is it will be
 
00:58:02.870 --> 00:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:07.510 --> 00:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
be I guess in direct U direct answer to
 
00:58:10.950 --> 00:58:10.960 align:start position:0%
your rules is pro proliferation a key
 
00:58:14.430 --> 00:58:14.440 align:start position:0%
issue it is the local community given
 
00:58:17.029 --> 00:58:17.039 align:start position:0%
the statutory responsibility that it has
 
00:58:19.510 --> 00:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
because we always talk about home rule
 
00:58:22.589 --> 00:58:22.599 align:start position:0%
by virtue of the of the rules that you
 
00:58:24.150 --> 00:58:24.160 align:start position:0%
have and I'm thinking of a planning
 
00:58:26.910 --> 00:58:26.920 align:start position:0%
board which re which is really the
 
00:58:29.109 --> 00:58:29.119 align:start position:0%
entity that would they deal with this
 
00:58:33.150 --> 00:58:33.160 align:start position:0%
has the has the control has the power
 
00:58:37.230 --> 00:58:37.240 align:start position:0%
and the AG could address this to say no
 
00:58:39.950 --> 00:58:39.960 align:start position:0%
that we do it we did it with Kino they
 
00:58:42.910 --> 00:58:42.920 align:start position:0%
have the ability to say no to Kino so
 
00:58:46.150 --> 00:58:46.160 align:start position:0%
the question is do they have do they
 
00:58:48.430 --> 00:58:48.440 align:start position:0%
have the ability to that would be a
 
00:58:51.069 --> 00:58:51.079 align:start position:0%
legislative yeah sure so if the
 
00:58:53.349 --> 00:58:53.359 align:start position:0%
legislature wanted to give the
 
00:58:56.109 --> 00:58:56.119 align:start position:0%
communities theth authority to say no
 
00:58:57.390 --> 00:58:57.400 align:start position:0%
that's something that would have to be
 
00:58:59.589 --> 00:58:59.599 align:start position:0%
done through a statute it's it's not
 
00:59:01.190 --> 00:59:01.200 align:start position:0%
something that the current Planning and
 
00:59:04.190 --> 00:59:04.200 align:start position:0%
Zoning statutory scheme
 
00:59:07.069 --> 00:59:07.079 align:start position:0%
addresses but currently and I don't want
 
00:59:08.510 --> 00:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
to go over with this because I don't
 
00:59:10.309 --> 00:59:10.319 align:start position:0%
other things but currently look like our
 
00:59:11.549 --> 00:59:11.559 align:start position:0%
it doesn't look right away it doesn't
 
00:59:16.190 --> 00:59:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:19.710 --> 00:59:19.720 align:start position:0%
of they will not okay so we have plenty
 
00:59:22.190 --> 00:59:22.200 align:start position:0%
of time but but currently there is a
 
00:59:24.309 --> 00:59:24.319 align:start position:0%
planning board situation that's that's
 
00:59:24.319 --> 00:59:25.190 align:start position:0%
planning board situation that's that's
in

00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:59:28.870 --> 00:59:28.880 align:start position:0%
effect uh and it's it's it's a situation
 
00:59:31.630 --> 00:59:31.640 align:start position:0%
where there was a granting a resending a
 
00:59:34.510 --> 00:59:34.520 align:start position:0%
granting so that thing is it in court as
 
00:59:38.190 --> 00:59:38.200 align:start position:0%
we speak or by virtue of the of the kind
 
00:59:40.549 --> 00:59:40.559 align:start position:0%
of activity that's taking place a local
 
00:59:42.990 --> 00:59:43.000 align:start position:0%
decision was made then a local decision
 
00:59:45.950 --> 00:59:45.960 align:start position:0%
was changed but that
 
00:59:48.309 --> 00:59:48.319 align:start position:0%
locality perceives that they have the
 
00:59:50.270 --> 00:59:50.280 align:start position:0%
right to say
 
00:59:53.670 --> 00:59:53.680 align:start position:0%
no WR I'm not familiar with the with the
 
00:59:55.789 --> 00:59:55.799 align:start position:0%
case senator that that you're referring
 
01:00:00.829 --> 01:00:00.839 align:start position:0%
to so um the the facts yeah the Conway
 
01:00:04.270 --> 01:00:04.280 align:start position:0%
case cway the cway case oh Conway case I
 
01:00:05.910 --> 01:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not familiar with the specifics of
 
01:00:09.029 --> 01:00:09.039 align:start position:0%
that case I'm sorry okay it's it's the
 
01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
only one that at the present time that I
 
01:00:13.789 --> 01:00:13.799 align:start position:0%
know but anyway that I think that sort
 
01:00:17.470 --> 01:00:17.480 align:start position:0%
of addresses your your your comments but
 
01:00:20.349 --> 01:00:20.359 align:start position:0%
but in essence doesn't because of
 
01:00:22.990 --> 01:00:23.000 align:start position:0%
because of the fact that proliferation
 
01:00:25.309 --> 01:00:25.319 align:start position:0%
has become so strong
 
01:00:26.670 --> 01:00:26.680 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
Charities have become a a very strong
 
01:00:32.990 --> 01:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
voice in this and and I think indeed
 
01:00:34.670 --> 01:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
those are the considerations that we're
 
01:00:36.270 --> 01:00:36.280 align:start position:0%
going to have to deal
 
01:00:40.190 --> 01:00:40.200 align:start position:0%
with absolutely so thank you just just
 
01:00:43.349 --> 01:00:43.359 align:start position:0%
the perception is we had perceived we
 
01:00:46.390 --> 01:00:46.400 align:start position:0%
had an option to say no we were it turns
 
01:00:49.230 --> 01:00:49.240 align:start position:0%
out we were not correct when it came
 
01:00:52.349 --> 01:00:52.359 align:start position:0%
down to the legal analysis that uh
 
01:00:55.910 --> 01:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
confronted us that the en roll and such
 
01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
made we can't so we do have it on the
 
01:01:03.029 --> 01:01:03.039 align:start position:0%
docket for the town meeting I've been
 
01:01:07.990 --> 01:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
told that if it passes out of you know
 
01:01:09.710 --> 01:01:09.720 align:start position:0%
if people vote their conscience rather
 
01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
than knowing that this could put the
 
01:01:14.870 --> 01:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
town in a pickle um then the town would
 
01:01:19.109 --> 01:01:19.119 align:start position:0%
not be able to enforce the this
 
01:01:21.829 --> 01:01:21.839 align:start position:0%
ordinance so we we are going to be one
 
01:01:23.910 --> 01:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
of the major issues that we're going to
 
01:01:27.029 --> 01:01:27.039 align:start position:0%
be discussing is the expansion
 
01:01:31.230 --> 01:01:31.240 align:start position:0%
and are we going to recommend to put a
 
01:01:33.349 --> 01:01:33.359 align:start position:0%
cap on that whether it be the number of
 
01:01:35.349 --> 01:01:35.359 align:start position:0%
facilities or to be the number of
 
01:01:37.789 --> 01:01:37.799 align:start position:0%
historic racing machines whatever form
 
01:01:41.549 --> 01:01:41.559 align:start position:0%
that that looks like now remember I know
 
01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
Senator you know this very well and
 
01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
representative Ames knows this well too
 
01:01:47.630 --> 01:01:47.640 align:start position:0%
working hard in those days when we're
 
01:01:50.230 --> 01:01:50.240 align:start position:0%
trying to get casinos not chable casinos
 
01:01:53.390 --> 01:01:53.400 align:start position:0%
casinos in the state and I think if I
 
01:01:54.870 --> 01:01:54.880 align:start position:0%
recall every one of those bills bills CU
 
01:01:56.150 --> 01:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
they always come the way mean Ways and
 
01:01:58.630 --> 01:01:58.640 align:start position:0%
Means all the time uh had a had an
 
01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:00.150 align:start position:0%
Means all the time uh had a had an
opt-in

01:02:00.150 --> 01:02:00.160 align:start position:0%
opt-in
 
01:02:03.109 --> 01:02:03.119 align:start position:0%
provision a local option and and one of
 
01:02:06.029 --> 01:02:06.039 align:start position:0%
every one of those so I'm not I'm
 
01:02:09.309 --> 01:02:09.319 align:start position:0%
personally not I don't object to a local
 
01:02:11.789 --> 01:02:11.799 align:start position:0%
option uh it's just it's going to be
 
01:02:15.150 --> 01:02:15.160 align:start position:0%
part of the larger discussion about how
 
01:02:17.349 --> 01:02:17.359 align:start position:0%
much proliferation is is the word
 
01:02:20.069 --> 01:02:20.079 align:start position:0%
Senator was using we're going to allow
 
01:02:21.390 --> 01:02:21.400 align:start position:0%
we're just going to let the market
 
01:02:25.309 --> 01:02:25.319 align:start position:0%
dictate it uh uh or is now the time
 
01:02:27.390 --> 01:02:27.400 align:start position:0%
because we're pausing here on everything
 
01:02:29.349 --> 01:02:29.359 align:start position:0%
having to do with Char gaming it's now
 
01:02:30.349 --> 01:02:30.359 align:start position:0%
the time and we're not going to go
 
01:02:33.309 --> 01:02:33.319 align:start position:0%
retrospectively to people the facilities
 
01:02:35.309 --> 01:02:35.319 align:start position:0%
that exist they exist we're not going to
 
01:02:36.750 --> 01:02:36.760 align:start position:0%
say those towns have to
 
01:02:39.950 --> 01:02:39.960 align:start position:0%
vote you know nille or whatever if if
 
01:02:42.750 --> 01:02:42.760 align:start position:0%
they existing now they can vote possibly
 
01:02:46.829 --> 01:02:46.839 align:start position:0%
for anything new in that town uh but I
 
01:02:49.109 --> 01:02:49.119 align:start position:0%
think we those grandfather in you can't
 
01:02:51.029 --> 01:02:51.039 align:start position:0%
you can't say to a a business that
 
01:02:53.430 --> 01:02:53.440 align:start position:0%
that's been uh spent a lot of money and
 
01:02:55.349 --> 01:02:55.359 align:start position:0%
invested that we're going to we're going
 
01:02:56.789 --> 01:02:56.799 align:start position:0%
to reverse that so that I think that
 
01:02:58.910 --> 01:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
goes without saying but I think we
 
01:03:02.589 --> 01:03:02.599 align:start position:0%
should say it though just in case but so
 
01:03:04.670 --> 01:03:04.680 align:start position:0%
I I think there's a lot of a lot of
 
01:03:07.870 --> 01:03:07.880 align:start position:0%
history here starting with lottery Kino
 
01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
sports betting even all of our Casino
 
01:03:16.390 --> 01:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
bills all talked about a provision an op
 
01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:17.309 align:start position:0%
bills all talked about a provision an op
in

01:03:17.309 --> 01:03:17.319 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:03:19.670 --> 01:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
provision um and that it's probably not
 
01:03:21.510 --> 01:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
a bad thing to look at as we progress
 
01:03:24.789 --> 01:03:24.799 align:start position:0%
here as a commission to uh to put as
 
01:03:26.349 --> 01:03:26.359 align:start position:0%
part of this for packet I don't know if
 
01:03:27.630 --> 01:03:27.640 align:start position:0%
it helps you in
 
01:03:30.190 --> 01:03:30.200 align:start position:0%
Littleton uh our timings everything if
 
01:03:31.589 --> 01:03:31.599 align:start position:0%
we had a commission last year maybe we
 
01:03:34.789 --> 01:03:34.799 align:start position:0%
would have but um you know but we we
 
01:03:36.430 --> 01:03:36.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for for coming in and helping
 
01:03:38.789 --> 01:03:38.799 align:start position:0%
us giving us a real life
 
01:03:40.910 --> 01:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
example you know and the only other
 
01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
thing I'll say you know there's other
 
01:03:43.710 --> 01:03:43.720 align:start position:0%
things like my town doesn't have a
 
01:03:45.750 --> 01:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
tattoo parlor and I don't think we're
 
01:03:48.510 --> 01:03:48.520 align:start position:0%
ever going to have a tattoo parlor right
 
01:03:50.990 --> 01:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
um and I
 
01:03:53.549 --> 01:03:53.559 align:start position:0%
so I know I never really checked this
 
01:03:56.109 --> 01:03:56.119 align:start position:0%
let me ask you maybe you know now do we
 
01:03:57.870 --> 01:03:57.880 align:start position:0%
somewhere along line say the tattoo
 
01:04:01.910 --> 01:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
parlers are noted in I don't know or you
 
01:04:04.349 --> 01:04:04.359 align:start position:0%
know but I just don't EnV Vision My Town
 
01:04:06.950 --> 01:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
ever was saying let's have a tatto par
 
01:04:10.069 --> 01:04:10.079 align:start position:0%
uh but tat PA are are I mean there's a
 
01:04:11.710 --> 01:04:11.720 align:start position:0%
little have a top tattoo
 
01:04:14.670 --> 01:04:14.680 align:start position:0%
paror you know I think it's possible to
 
01:04:17.430 --> 01:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
get a tattoo in Littleton I believe so
 
01:04:21.430 --> 01:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah so but those are those are
 
01:04:25.029 --> 01:04:25.039 align:start position:0%
those are the kind of things that uh
 
01:04:27.589 --> 01:04:27.599 align:start position:0%
people either would be really for or
 
01:04:31.269 --> 01:04:31.279 align:start position:0%
really against so so anyway yes any
 
01:04:31.279 --> 01:04:32.430 align:start position:0%
really against so so anyway yes any
other

01:04:32.430 --> 01:04:32.440 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:04:35.069 --> 01:04:35.079 align:start position:0%
questions oh thank you very much I I do
 
01:04:37.589 --> 01:04:37.599 align:start position:0%
so much appreciate being invited here to
 
01:04:39.990 --> 01:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
share this with you and yeah if you do
 
01:04:42.549 --> 01:04:42.559 align:start position:0%
something about this in in your reports
 
01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
and your recommendations if the
 
01:04:46.510 --> 01:04:46.520 align:start position:0%
legislature happens to extend the
 
01:04:49.430 --> 01:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
moratorium it might very well be helpful
 
01:04:53.109 --> 01:04:53.119 align:start position:0%
to Littleton over the period of time
 
01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
yeah again I just told know how that
 
01:04:58.309 --> 01:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
works if if there's a few uh in the
 
01:05:00.309 --> 01:05:00.319 align:start position:0%
pipeline right well I don't know what
 
01:05:02.349 --> 01:05:02.359 align:start position:0%
the pipeline is but you know to the
 
01:05:04.870 --> 01:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
approval process can they be boxed out I
 
01:05:08.029 --> 01:05:08.039 align:start position:0%
don't know but anyway well we we do
 
01:05:09.470 --> 01:05:09.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate it all right thank you thank
 
01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
you for coming in we love guest I was
 
01:05:13.990 --> 01:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
worried most about you coming from North
 
01:05:17.910 --> 01:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
but you had list the North had uh less
 
01:05:19.630 --> 01:05:19.640 align:start position:0%
know than down here
 
01:05:21.870 --> 01:05:21.880 align:start position:0%
actually well it was a beautiful drive I
 
01:05:22.950 --> 01:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
guess getting out of your driveway was
 
01:05:25.190 --> 01:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
the hardest part right the ski are is a
 
01:05:27.829 --> 01:05:27.839 align:start position:0%
happy we got good snow okay well thank
 
01:05:30.829 --> 01:05:30.839 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
01:05:34.150 --> 01:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
much okay I actually skipped over one um
 
01:05:36.349 --> 01:05:36.359 align:start position:0%
when we were talking about the uh
 
01:05:39.269 --> 01:05:39.279 align:start position:0%
charal uh responsible
 
01:05:44.990 --> 01:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
gaming last meeting we we discovered Le
 
01:05:47.950 --> 01:05:47.960 align:start position:0%
uh the commission discovered that one of
 
01:05:50.750 --> 01:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
the major vendors that's
 
01:05:52.829 --> 01:05:52.839 align:start position:0%
participating doesn't have breakage in
 
01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
its in its system
 
01:05:59.470 --> 01:05:59.480 align:start position:0%
so basically only two of the three
 
01:06:02.349 --> 01:06:02.359 align:start position:0%
vendors three four or three or four
 
01:06:05.309 --> 01:06:05.319 align:start position:0%
vendors uh or three of the of the four
 
01:06:09.230 --> 01:06:09.240 align:start position:0%
vendors or whatever it is one of them
 
01:06:11.990 --> 01:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't uh have the ability in their
 
01:06:15.349 --> 01:06:15.359 align:start position:0%
software to do breakage so to me that's
 
01:06:19.190 --> 01:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
an issue so how can we have one not
 
01:06:23.470 --> 01:06:23.480 align:start position:0%
doing it and three doing it so again
 
01:06:24.670 --> 01:06:24.680 align:start position:0%
well we
 
01:06:26.430 --> 01:06:26.440 align:start position:0%
we know that breakage has become an
 
01:06:30.829 --> 01:06:30.839 align:start position:0%
issue and uh CH I think you said that
 
01:06:32.309 --> 01:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
there was a situation where people
 
01:06:34.390 --> 01:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
weren't even going to consider it they
 
01:06:36.349 --> 01:06:36.359 align:start position:0%
weren't going to consider breakage right
 
01:06:37.789 --> 01:06:37.799 align:start position:0%
you're going to create something that's
 
01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
going to but breakage has always been
 
01:06:44.990 --> 01:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
has always been an issue because people
 
01:06:46.349 --> 01:06:46.359 align:start position:0%
first of all don't understand what
 
01:06:48.670 --> 01:06:48.680 align:start position:0%
breakage is that's the first point that
 
01:06:50.150 --> 01:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
should be brought forward and they don't
 
01:06:52.630 --> 01:06:52.640 align:start position:0%
realize the magnitude of of
 
01:06:54.990 --> 01:06:55.000 align:start position:0%
breakage uh
 
01:06:57.109 --> 01:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
because of that intricate situ the
 
01:07:01.109 --> 01:07:01.119 align:start position:0%
paramutual situation it could be 9 cents
 
01:07:03.190 --> 01:07:03.200 align:start position:0%
right and and if it's 9 cents and you
 
01:07:05.789 --> 01:07:05.799 align:start position:0%
got lots of money waged and lots of
 
01:07:08.190 --> 01:07:08.200 align:start position:0%
races that accounts to a lot of money
 
01:07:09.950 --> 01:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
and we were told that the breakage this
 
01:07:12.870 --> 01:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
year from the historic conation Maes
 
01:07:14.230 --> 01:07:14.240 align:start position:0%
exceeded the
 
01:07:16.870 --> 01:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
150,000 that we thought it would be
 
01:07:20.109 --> 01:07:20.119 align:start position:0%
right wasn't that your comment Char was
 
01:07:23.190 --> 01:07:23.200 align:start position:0%
100,000 exceeded okay 100,000 so so you
 
01:07:24.510 --> 01:07:24.520 align:start position:0%
got 100,000
 
01:07:27.390 --> 01:07:27.400 align:start position:0%
here that in the old days was split it
 
01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
was split between the track and and the
 
01:07:34.029 --> 01:07:34.039 align:start position:0%
state well now you got a situation where
 
01:07:35.950 --> 01:07:35.960 align:start position:0%
there's no track you're not going to
 
01:07:37.670 --> 01:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
give it back to church towns right
 
01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
because we're just buying the signal at
 
01:07:41.710 --> 01:07:41.720 align:start position:0%
at this point in time so they're not
 
01:07:44.510 --> 01:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
entitled to the breakage so who gets the
 
01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
breakage and how do you how do you how
 
01:07:50.190 --> 01:07:50.200 align:start position:0%
do you account for the for the breakage
 
01:07:52.710 --> 01:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
now as I say it was larger than
 
01:07:55.190 --> 01:07:55.200 align:start position:0%
anticipated with the initial
 
01:07:57.670 --> 01:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
introduction of the machines well the
 
01:07:59.870 --> 01:07:59.880 align:start position:0%
machines are are going pretty strong so
 
01:08:02.029 --> 01:08:02.039 align:start position:0%
the breakage is going to become a bigger
 
01:08:04.630 --> 01:08:04.640 align:start position:0%
issue now certainly one way to address
 
01:08:08.069 --> 01:08:08.079 align:start position:0%
it is to eliminate it period and and
 
01:08:11.349 --> 01:08:11.359 align:start position:0%
just the state would keep it right well
 
01:08:12.910 --> 01:08:12.920 align:start position:0%
there's a couple options that's why I
 
01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
want to have to start this conversation
 
01:08:16.189 --> 01:08:16.199 align:start position:0%
here today and I'm not going to conclude
 
01:08:19.709 --> 01:08:19.719 align:start position:0%
anything today but so so we have one
 
01:08:20.870 --> 01:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
that can't doesn't have it in their
 
01:08:22.709 --> 01:08:22.719 align:start position:0%
software we're not going to tell them
 
01:08:25.510 --> 01:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
put it in your software right you know
 
01:08:29.630 --> 01:08:29.640 align:start position:0%
um so now my understanding is that let's
 
01:08:31.390 --> 01:08:31.400 align:start position:0%
just talk broader let's talk slot
 
01:08:36.149 --> 01:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
machines too okay right that that these
 
01:08:38.669 --> 01:08:38.679 align:start position:0%
vendors do pay a fee that's larger than
 
01:08:40.910 --> 01:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
the fee that we charge them to be to
 
01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:42.149 align:start position:0%
the fee that we charge them to be to
work

01:08:42.149 --> 01:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:08:44.829 --> 01:08:44.839 align:start position:0%
here um I mean is that one option to say
 
01:08:47.910 --> 01:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
we get rid of the breakage and we put an
 
01:08:50.189 --> 01:08:50.199 align:start position:0%
annual fee that's more
 
01:08:54.510 --> 01:08:54.520 align:start position:0%
reasonable on these on these uh vendors
 
01:08:56.709 --> 01:08:56.719 align:start position:0%
that that's that's one of them now I I
 
01:08:57.990 --> 01:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
don't want to Blindside them we could
 
01:08:58.950 --> 01:08:58.960 align:start position:0%
phase that
 
01:09:03.990 --> 01:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
in uh but I mean that the obviously the
 
01:09:07.070 --> 01:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
vendors aren't gaining from the breakage
 
01:09:09.309 --> 01:09:09.319 align:start position:0%
it's just passing through right and they
 
01:09:11.470 --> 01:09:11.480 align:start position:0%
have the software which they've already
 
01:09:14.189 --> 01:09:14.199 align:start position:0%
developed so I I just again I'm trying
 
01:09:15.590 --> 01:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
to get this conversation started here
 
01:09:17.070 --> 01:09:17.080 align:start position:0%
I'm looking right at you because you
 
01:09:19.510 --> 01:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
you're from one of the facilities I mean
 
01:09:21.630 --> 01:09:21.640 align:start position:0%
what's trying to understand what's a
 
01:09:25.630 --> 01:09:25.640 align:start position:0%
reasonable way of fixing this
 
01:09:28.789 --> 01:09:28.799 align:start position:0%
um now you could say it's not broken but
 
01:09:32.030 --> 01:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
I I you know no I I fully understand I I
 
01:09:34.590 --> 01:09:34.600 align:start position:0%
think one reasonable way to do it would
 
01:09:37.149 --> 01:09:37.159 align:start position:0%
be go to the one manufacturer who
 
01:09:40.229 --> 01:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't have breakage and say um in
 
01:09:42.630 --> 01:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
terms of your machine placement or games
 
01:09:44.749 --> 01:09:44.759 align:start position:0%
on your system as a percentage you have
 
01:09:46.510 --> 01:09:46.520 align:start position:0%
to make up for that or you can fix it
 
01:09:47.669 --> 01:09:47.679 align:start position:0%
give them the
 
01:09:51.030 --> 01:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
option either fix it or or make it and
 
01:09:52.709 --> 01:09:52.719 align:start position:0%
give them the
 
01:09:52.719 --> 01:09:55.189 align:start position:0%
give them the
choice

01:09:55.189 --> 01:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
choice
 
01:09:56.550 --> 01:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
yeah if I could certainly so we're
 
01:09:57.910 --> 01:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
talking about breakage really breakage
 
01:10:00.390 --> 01:10:00.400 align:start position:0%
takes two forms with us one is the
 
01:10:02.990 --> 01:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
breakage for the actual horse racing
 
01:10:06.430 --> 01:10:06.440 align:start position:0%
simal cast Revenue at the one facility
 
01:10:07.790 --> 01:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
and obviously there's the breakage that
 
01:10:09.550 --> 01:10:09.560 align:start position:0%
resists in the store for racing machine
 
01:10:12.630 --> 01:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
so it's there's two pools of breakage
 
01:10:14.030 --> 01:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure we're talking
 
01:10:15.430 --> 01:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
about the historic oration machine
 
01:10:19.750 --> 01:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
breakage and the lack of uh Unity
 
01:10:23.189 --> 01:10:23.199 align:start position:0%
uniformity amongst the manufacturers and
 
01:10:25.390 --> 01:10:25.400 align:start position:0%
that the sound cast not the s cast
 
01:10:28.189 --> 01:10:28.199 align:start position:0%
correct s cast is fine cor so that's
 
01:10:30.350 --> 01:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
that's why I I hesitate to sort of say
 
01:10:32.030 --> 01:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
breakage and sort of not even part of
 
01:10:34.270 --> 01:10:34.280 align:start position:0%
gaming correct it's not Char gaming
 
01:10:36.750 --> 01:10:36.760 align:start position:0%
correct and we do get the break correct
 
01:10:38.350 --> 01:10:38.360 align:start position:0%
and the reason the their revenues are
 
01:10:40.910 --> 01:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
exceeded is because Ian the revenues
 
01:10:42.510 --> 01:10:42.520 align:start position:0%
from breakage are larger than we
 
01:10:44.229 --> 01:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
expected because the revenues from
 
01:10:45.550 --> 01:10:45.560 align:start position:0%
histor horse racing larger than we
 
01:10:47.790 --> 01:10:47.800 align:start position:0%
expected so this particular
 
01:10:50.870 --> 01:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
vendor is it what percentage of the
 
01:10:54.189 --> 01:10:54.199 align:start position:0%
machines any idea I would would say
 
01:10:58.229 --> 01:10:58.239 align:start position:0%
probably 50 60% I was thinking 60% of
 
01:10:59.790 --> 01:10:59.800 align:start position:0%
machines in the state yes that don't
 
01:11:02.950 --> 01:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
have correct and and and within a pretty
 
01:11:04.669 --> 01:11:04.679 align:start position:0%
close mathematical certainty we could
 
01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
come to a number which would we expect
 
01:11:08.990 --> 01:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
breakage to be on the activity
 
01:11:10.990 --> 01:11:11.000 align:start position:0%
undergoing now I don't have that you
 
01:11:11.830 --> 01:11:11.840 align:start position:0%
know I haven't done the back of the
 
01:11:13.790 --> 01:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
envelope math here but I would suggest
 
01:11:15.030 --> 01:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
we come with a number that's pretty
 
01:11:16.630 --> 01:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
close to Accurate so I think they would
 
01:11:18.510 --> 01:11:18.520 align:start position:0%
understand if we say look we we passed a
 
01:11:20.910 --> 01:11:20.920 align:start position:0%
statute that said there was going to be
 
01:11:22.550 --> 01:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
breakage that was going to fund our
 
01:11:25.149 --> 01:11:25.159 align:start position:0%
responsible gambling
 
01:11:27.590 --> 01:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
fund and you're not complying with the
 
01:11:30.390 --> 01:11:30.400 align:start position:0%
law the law said you needed to do this
 
01:11:32.709 --> 01:11:32.719 align:start position:0%
and they're not doing it so we can we
 
01:11:34.550 --> 01:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
can give it some time to to either get
 
01:11:36.270 --> 01:11:36.280 align:start position:0%
that application or say we have to come
 
01:11:38.510 --> 01:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
up with we have to be reasonable a
 
01:11:40.350 --> 01:11:40.360 align:start position:0%
reasonable dollar amount that is
 
01:11:44.110 --> 01:11:44.120 align:start position:0%
equivalent to that um to to play here
 
01:11:47.430 --> 01:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
repres just reflecting my ignorance
 
01:11:54.669 --> 01:11:54.679 align:start position:0%
where this manufacturer
 
01:11:56.990 --> 01:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
and The Operators that use those
 
01:11:59.310 --> 01:11:59.320 align:start position:0%
machines where does the breakage money
 
01:12:01.790 --> 01:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
go now where what's happening to that
 
01:12:04.510 --> 01:12:04.520 align:start position:0%
breakage money whose money is it so the
 
01:12:06.310 --> 01:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
breakage actually rolls back into the
 
01:12:09.510 --> 01:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
prize pool into the pool correct and
 
01:12:11.750 --> 01:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
that's the paramutual system correct so
 
01:12:13.669 --> 01:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
that there's no breakage it's just the
 
01:12:17.830 --> 01:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
the the odd sense is then re re so so my
 
01:12:20.990 --> 01:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
question is why why is that a problem
 
01:12:23.910 --> 01:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
it's going back to the to the Gamble in
 
01:12:26.510 --> 01:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
effect correct it's it's part of the pro
 
01:12:29.669 --> 01:12:29.679 align:start position:0%
yes as not going to the operator no it's
 
01:12:31.590 --> 01:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
not not going to the operator North the
 
01:12:33.910 --> 01:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
state and there's no yeah suggestion to
 
01:12:36.750 --> 01:12:36.760 align:start position:0%
that it's just that that there's a a
 
01:12:39.629 --> 01:12:39.639 align:start position:0%
required takeout of breakage that's not
 
01:12:41.910 --> 01:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
occurring currently so once again we can
 
01:12:43.189 --> 01:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
fix it and make it so that there's no
 
01:12:45.110 --> 01:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
breakage and it goes back to the player
 
01:12:47.629 --> 01:12:47.639 align:start position:0%
across all the platforms but once again
 
01:12:49.149 --> 01:12:49.159 align:start position:0%
that would require reprogramming on the
 
01:12:51.189 --> 01:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
rest of the
 
01:12:55.030 --> 01:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
systems but if we did that then we
 
01:12:56.709 --> 01:12:56.719 align:start position:0%
I guess what I what I want to understand
 
01:13:00.669 --> 01:13:00.679 align:start position:0%
is our fees we do charge a fee for the
 
01:13:03.110 --> 01:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
these vendors to play here right to have
 
01:13:05.790 --> 01:13:05.800 align:start position:0%
their machines in place manufacturers no
 
01:13:08.870 --> 01:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
Do all states have them yes usually like
 
01:13:12.189 --> 01:13:12.199 align:start position:0%
I think the materials I had distributed
 
01:13:15.030 --> 01:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
two meetings ago right I think Main's is
 
01:13:17.390 --> 01:13:17.400 align:start position:0%
200,000 I don't know what Massachusetts
 
01:13:19.550 --> 01:13:19.560 align:start position:0%
is but it's I think it's larger and then
 
01:13:24.270 --> 01:13:24.280 align:start position:0%
they pay $600 a year per machine
 
01:13:26.110 --> 01:13:26.120 align:start position:0%
to the state as
 
01:13:29.629 --> 01:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
well so again we we we got some thinking
 
01:13:33.229 --> 01:13:33.239 align:start position:0%
to do on this one um again it's like
 
01:13:35.350 --> 01:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
anything else you know we have a lot of
 
01:13:36.950 --> 01:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
players coming in here now a lot of
 
01:13:41.110 --> 01:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
vendors I mean vendors but
 
01:13:44.550 --> 01:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
um but it's it seems like common
 
01:13:47.470 --> 01:13:47.480 align:start position:0%
practice to to charge the vendors to be
 
01:13:50.110 --> 01:13:50.120 align:start position:0%
here except we're giving him a
 
01:13:55.430 --> 01:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
freebie here you are come on in so uh I
 
01:13:56.910 --> 01:13:56.920 align:start position:0%
think we have to think about it as a
 
01:13:58.830 --> 01:13:58.840 align:start position:0%
commission how we want to handle this
 
01:14:00.189 --> 01:14:00.199 align:start position:0%
not today but it's going to come up on
 
01:14:02.390 --> 01:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
agenda again give some thought to any
 
01:14:04.350 --> 01:14:04.360 align:start position:0%
other ideas that people may
 
01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:06.229 align:start position:0%
other ideas that people may
have

01:14:06.229 --> 01:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:14:08.470 --> 01:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
uh would
 
01:14:10.510 --> 01:14:10.520 align:start position:0%
the maybe maybe we should bring the
 
01:14:13.229 --> 01:14:13.239 align:start position:0%
vendors in I don't know talk to them I
 
01:14:15.189 --> 01:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
don't know I'm trying to be fair here I
 
01:14:17.350 --> 01:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
mean certainly um they were certainly
 
01:14:18.990 --> 01:14:19.000 align:start position:0%
here when we were they were here when we
 
01:14:20.350 --> 01:14:20.360 align:start position:0%
were doing historic racing they they
 
01:14:22.910 --> 01:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
were sitting at these STS um yeah
 
01:14:24.270 --> 01:14:24.280 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of them were not all of
 
01:14:29.310 --> 01:14:29.320 align:start position:0%
them not all of them yeah right so
 
01:14:33.910 --> 01:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
um I again I I you know we we
 
01:14:36.310 --> 01:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
could we can well we can do one or three
 
01:14:38.709 --> 01:14:38.719 align:start position:0%
or four things and we just have decide
 
01:14:43.830 --> 01:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
which which is reasonable we um fair
 
01:14:48.950 --> 01:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
this can be um and um he it's almost
 
01:14:51.149 --> 01:14:51.159 align:start position:0%
like a a retroactive tax I I don't like
 
01:14:55.189 --> 01:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
that either but uh um but I think the
 
01:14:57.149 --> 01:14:57.159 align:start position:0%
vendors realized they're boy this is a
 
01:14:58.550 --> 01:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
good state to come to do this because
 
01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
we're not being charged anything to to
 
01:15:03.629 --> 01:15:03.639 align:start position:0%
uh to lease our machines
 
01:15:03.639 --> 01:15:05.229 align:start position:0%
uh to lease our machines
here

01:15:05.229 --> 01:15:05.239 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:15:07.270 --> 01:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
um but we can we can come up a
 
01:15:10.189 --> 01:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
reasonable number as well it's not as
 
01:15:13.590 --> 01:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
high as 200,000 a year uh and still I
 
01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
think we would we would come up with a
 
01:15:16.590 --> 01:15:16.600 align:start position:0%
number that would
 
01:15:20.189 --> 01:15:20.199 align:start position:0%
be uh we feel would fund we could point
 
01:15:24.550 --> 01:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
that money to the CH gaming fund the uh
 
01:15:26.149 --> 01:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
the problem gaming
 
01:15:29.830 --> 01:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
fund um and U and say to them hey thanks
 
01:15:32.189 --> 01:15:32.199 align:start position:0%
for helping contribute to our ter game
 
01:15:35.950 --> 01:15:35.960 align:start position:0%
because so again um it's not an easy one
 
01:15:38.390 --> 01:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
because we have to backtrack but again
 
01:15:39.709 --> 01:15:39.719 align:start position:0%
that they're in violation of the law
 
01:15:42.790 --> 01:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
that we said that we had
 
01:15:46.390 --> 01:15:46.400 align:start position:0%
breakage that was going to to the to the
 
01:15:48.590 --> 01:15:48.600 align:start position:0%
problem ging and you your machines
 
01:15:51.870 --> 01:15:51.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:55.110 --> 01:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
that John just a just a general question
 
01:15:57.709 --> 01:15:57.719 align:start position:0%
um is the problem gaming fund only
 
01:15:59.950 --> 01:15:59.960 align:start position:0%
funded through breakage or there other
 
01:16:02.430 --> 01:16:02.440 align:start position:0%
sources well it's it's funded through
 
01:16:05.270 --> 01:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
the Char Charlie's
 
01:16:08.070 --> 01:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
budget until they until the breakage
 
01:16:11.669 --> 01:16:11.679 align:start position:0%
hits that budget amount then right right
 
01:16:13.350 --> 01:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
and then if if it exceeds the budget
 
01:16:16.110 --> 01:16:16.120 align:start position:0%
amount then it it
 
01:16:18.590 --> 01:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
continue uh to go into the fund I guess
 
01:16:20.590 --> 01:16:20.600 align:start position:0%
right it's actually to be truthful it's
 
01:16:22.830 --> 01:16:22.840 align:start position:0%
an accounting problem because we're
 
01:16:25.030 --> 01:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
having too much money and so it says
 
01:16:27.510 --> 01:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
this money has to go to the to problem
 
01:16:29.990 --> 01:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
gambling fund but we're in excess of
 
01:16:31.910 --> 01:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
that so it's I don't explain it but in
 
01:16:33.629 --> 01:16:33.639 align:start position:0%
the accting we're almost carrying over
 
01:16:35.390 --> 01:16:35.400 align:start position:0%
revenues for prior years to Future years
 
01:16:37.750 --> 01:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
to fund problem gambling so when it was
 
01:16:40.510 --> 01:16:40.520 align:start position:0%
100,000 it was much more than breakage
 
01:16:43.430 --> 01:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
amount was much higher than the budgeted
 
01:16:45.709 --> 01:16:45.719 align:start position:0%
amount and so our CFO literally has a
 
01:16:48.510 --> 01:16:48.520 align:start position:0%
carryover amount from prior years and so
 
01:16:49.990 --> 01:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
it hasn't really transferred and
 
01:16:51.629 --> 01:16:51.639 align:start position:0%
honestly for us it's really a rounding
 
01:16:54.709 --> 01:16:54.719 align:start position:0%
error Le well $187 Million last year is
 
01:16:57.550 --> 01:16:57.560 align:start position:0%
our net revenue so$ 100,000 is you know
 
01:16:59.030 --> 01:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
I don't say the rounding ER but in terms
 
01:17:02.390 --> 01:17:02.400 align:start position:0%
of it kind of is but you know we it was
 
01:17:03.669 --> 01:17:03.679 align:start position:0%
a I believe it's going to be a finding
 
01:17:06.950 --> 01:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
on our audit that it's not
 
01:17:09.870 --> 01:17:09.880 align:start position:0%
properly done
 
01:17:12.790 --> 01:17:12.800 align:start position:0%
essentially no I
 
01:17:15.470 --> 01:17:15.480 align:start position:0%
I I do I do commissions have been a lot
 
01:17:17.629 --> 01:17:17.639 align:start position:0%
of commissions and one was on uh
 
01:17:19.390 --> 01:17:19.400 align:start position:0%
distribution of electricity and water
 
01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:20.270 align:start position:0%
distribution of electricity and water
and

01:17:20.270 --> 01:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:17:23.229 --> 01:17:23.239 align:start position:0%
gas and I had the I had the vendors and
 
01:17:25.629 --> 01:17:25.639 align:start position:0%
I had all the key all the four electric
 
01:17:27.629 --> 01:17:27.639 align:start position:0%
companies in the room so we need to
 
01:17:28.709 --> 01:17:28.719 align:start position:0%
solve a
 
01:17:31.790 --> 01:17:31.800 align:start position:0%
problem and gave them an opportunity to
 
01:17:33.070 --> 01:17:33.080 align:start position:0%
come up with a
 
01:17:36.229 --> 01:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
solution so that's why I wouldn't mind
 
01:17:38.310 --> 01:17:38.320 align:start position:0%
inviting them to say hey we got a
 
01:17:39.910 --> 01:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
problem maybe at least talk to them and
 
01:17:41.669 --> 01:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
say hey we got this
 
01:17:45.270 --> 01:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
issue uh we were trying to fund our our
 
01:17:46.990 --> 01:17:47.000 align:start position:0%
our uh problem
 
01:17:49.669 --> 01:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
gaming um we know you contribute a lot
 
01:17:51.070 --> 01:17:51.080 align:start position:0%
to other states you're not really
 
01:17:53.590 --> 01:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
contributing much here what be a problem
 
01:17:55.470 --> 01:17:55.480 align:start position:0%
if we were to assess a certain amount
 
01:17:56.950 --> 01:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
and we'd be reasonable and have them
 
01:18:00.110 --> 01:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
help us carve that out to
 
01:18:03.470 --> 01:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
be it always works I always start with
 
01:18:05.910 --> 01:18:05.920 align:start position:0%
is there a problem yes there is okay
 
01:18:08.070 --> 01:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
let's come up with a solution and we can
 
01:18:11.550 --> 01:18:11.560 align:start position:0%
have them help us with a solution um um
 
01:18:14.470 --> 01:18:14.480 align:start position:0%
in terms of what we all think is
 
01:18:18.070 --> 01:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
reasonable okay well I I think the that
 
01:18:21.270 --> 01:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
the solution really contains a number of
 
01:18:23.830 --> 01:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
issues as long as you you have an
 
01:18:26.510 --> 01:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
expansive situation the breakage problem
 
01:18:28.149 --> 01:18:28.159 align:start position:0%
will continue to exacerbate because
 
01:18:29.990 --> 01:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
you're going to make more money so
 
01:18:32.229 --> 01:18:32.239 align:start position:0%
that's a key issue is there going to be
 
01:18:34.149 --> 01:18:34.159 align:start position:0%
a situation where some kind of a
 
01:18:36.790 --> 01:18:36.800 align:start position:0%
moratorium is put on a the number of
 
01:18:39.430 --> 01:18:39.440 align:start position:0%
machines that are in play in be the
 
01:18:41.629 --> 01:18:41.639 align:start position:0%
number of licenses that that that you
 
01:18:45.470 --> 01:18:45.480 align:start position:0%
give if if that problem is is addressed
 
01:18:47.669 --> 01:18:47.679 align:start position:0%
then the breakage problem is easily
 
01:18:49.390 --> 01:18:49.400 align:start position:0%
addressed because you make a decision
 
01:18:51.510 --> 01:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
you say either the software associated
 
01:18:54.550 --> 01:18:54.560 align:start position:0%
with the machines is is going to be put
 
01:18:56.310 --> 01:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
in place and there'll be a fee
 
01:18:59.030 --> 01:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
associated with what breakage used to be
 
01:19:00.310 --> 01:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
because we can't do anything to the
 
01:19:01.990 --> 01:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
track they're going to get their brakets
 
01:19:03.669 --> 01:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
because they they're taking the money at
 
01:19:05.709 --> 01:19:05.719 align:start position:0%
that end
 
01:19:09.310 --> 01:19:09.320 align:start position:0%
so the the key element is is going to be
 
01:19:12.510 --> 01:19:12.520 align:start position:0%
the expansive nature of this
 
01:19:16.669 --> 01:19:16.679 align:start position:0%
business and is there is there a desire
 
01:19:19.030 --> 01:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
to cap that now we have two Bills
 
01:19:21.470 --> 01:19:21.480 align:start position:0%
currently before the legislature that
 
01:19:24.470 --> 01:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
call for moratorium one is a moratorium
 
01:19:27.110 --> 01:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
forever and I think another one is is is
 
01:19:29.110 --> 01:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
sing is it seven
 
01:19:32.870 --> 01:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
years the piece of so you got two bills
 
01:19:37.189 --> 01:19:37.199 align:start position:0%
trying to address this this particular
 
01:19:40.709 --> 01:19:40.719 align:start position:0%
situation it in in my opinion unless we
 
01:19:43.750 --> 01:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
address those situations and we have to
 
01:19:45.350 --> 01:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
do that
 
01:19:49.149 --> 01:19:49.159 align:start position:0%
legislatively uh then the problems that
 
01:19:51.870 --> 01:19:51.880 align:start position:0%
that we're discussing will continue to
 
01:19:54.030 --> 01:19:54.040 align:start position:0%
to exacerbate because you got to solve
 
01:19:57.910 --> 01:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
the big problem first how many how many
 
01:20:02.430 --> 01:20:02.440 align:start position:0%
in in both instances right and
 
01:20:04.750 --> 01:20:04.760 align:start position:0%
currently it it's still difficult for me
 
01:20:07.229 --> 01:20:07.239 align:start position:0%
to get a handle of how many we have in
 
01:20:11.110 --> 01:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
operation but is it 10 or is it 15 or is
 
01:20:14.390 --> 01:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
it 10 and five licenses are hanging out
 
01:20:16.629 --> 01:20:16.639 align:start position:0%
there to be worked worked upon it at
 
01:20:19.590 --> 01:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
this time before you go Tim um so the
 
01:20:21.830 --> 01:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
last agenda item is to talk talk about
 
01:20:24.550 --> 01:20:24.560 align:start position:0%
real quickly the bills that are hanging
 
01:20:29.390 --> 01:20:29.400 align:start position:0%
out there right now both from the I I I
 
01:20:31.950 --> 01:20:31.960 align:start position:0%
asked representive to to do because I
 
01:20:32.709 --> 01:20:32.719 align:start position:0%
think I don't know if you were going to
 
01:20:35.990 --> 01:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
make it here uh both the Senate and the
 
01:20:39.229 --> 01:20:39.239 align:start position:0%
house represent said to talk briefly
 
01:20:41.430 --> 01:20:41.440 align:start position:0%
about the bills that are out there so we
 
01:20:43.070 --> 01:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
might be able to do that right now and
 
01:20:44.669 --> 01:20:44.679 align:start position:0%
then we come back to the other gend item
 
01:20:47.390 --> 01:20:47.400 align:start position:0%
so do we want to try to do that
 
01:20:51.550 --> 01:20:51.560 align:start position:0%
now okay okay but indeed the the big
 
01:20:53.950 --> 01:20:53.960 align:start position:0%
problem the big problem we have that's
 
01:20:58.870 --> 01:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
that's hanging o over us now is how many
 
01:21:01.350 --> 01:21:01.360 align:start position:0%
in both instances how many licenses are
 
01:21:03.070 --> 01:21:03.080 align:start position:0%
going to be issued is there going to be
 
01:21:07.310 --> 01:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
a all right and B is there going to be a
 
01:21:10.110 --> 01:21:10.120 align:start position:0%
moratorium on on the licenses and the
 
01:21:12.910 --> 01:21:12.920 align:start position:0%
number of machines that that are given
 
01:21:15.830 --> 01:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
out that are allowed to be those are the
 
01:21:17.830 --> 01:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
big questions for the commission looks
 
01:21:19.870 --> 01:21:19.880 align:start position:0%
like we've got action and both the house
 
01:21:23.669 --> 01:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
and the Senate um again
 
01:21:25.669 --> 01:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
it's not a constitutional change so
 
01:21:27.390 --> 01:21:27.400 align:start position:0%
anything that that happens in the house
 
01:21:29.870 --> 01:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
at the senate or both agree can be
 
01:21:31.550 --> 01:21:31.560 align:start position:0%
changed next year after the commission
 
01:21:34.790 --> 01:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
does their work finishes their work but
 
01:21:38.110 --> 01:21:38.120 align:start position:0%
um so but
 
01:21:41.270 --> 01:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
Senator no again so I want to bring the
 
01:21:42.870 --> 01:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
conversation back to
 
01:21:45.750 --> 01:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
breakage than a bigger conversation
 
01:21:48.390 --> 01:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
about perfect liation or HHR in general
 
01:21:50.189 --> 01:21:50.199 align:start position:0%
so I guess my question Charlie is you
 
01:21:51.709 --> 01:21:51.719 align:start position:0%
said there's at least one operator
 
01:21:53.390 --> 01:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
that's not doing break AG right now at
 
01:21:56.750 --> 01:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
all what manuf call manufacturers is it
 
01:21:58.430 --> 01:21:58.440 align:start position:0%
they're not going to ever do it or they
 
01:22:00.629 --> 01:22:00.639 align:start position:0%
have to adjust their software to do it
 
01:22:02.310 --> 01:22:02.320 align:start position:0%
they would have to up their software to
 
01:22:03.870 --> 01:22:03.880 align:start position:0%
do it and every machine on the floor
 
01:22:05.030 --> 01:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
they have
 
01:22:07.590 --> 01:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
to but have they indicated they will or
 
01:22:10.950 --> 01:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
won't indicator they will I haven't
 
01:22:13.270 --> 01:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
pushed the question as
 
01:22:16.149 --> 01:22:16.159 align:start position:0%
to I can push in order to compel them
 
01:22:18.830 --> 01:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
but that'll shut down a jar for a period
 
01:22:21.270 --> 01:22:21.280 align:start position:0%
of time so followup question again I
 
01:22:22.310 --> 01:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
want to remind everybody I think the
 
01:22:24.950 --> 01:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
issue is we have too much money um was
 
01:22:26.590 --> 01:22:26.600 align:start position:0%
the problem was we were we from the
 
01:22:28.030 --> 01:22:28.040 align:start position:0%
breakage we were already receiving from
 
01:22:29.629 --> 01:22:29.639 align:start position:0%
the vendors that are doing it was
 
01:22:31.189 --> 01:22:31.199 align:start position:0%
greater than the expenditure we were
 
01:22:34.790 --> 01:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
making in in uh breakage and and for the
 
01:22:36.629 --> 01:22:36.639 align:start position:0%
purposes of responsible gaming and so
 
01:22:38.430 --> 01:22:38.440 align:start position:0%
there was an adjustment uh to be made in
 
01:22:41.229 --> 01:22:41.239 align:start position:0%
the budget to to deal with this influx
 
01:22:43.189 --> 01:22:43.199 align:start position:0%
of Revenue that we had that we had no
 
01:22:44.790 --> 01:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
place to put because we didn't have an
 
01:22:47.110 --> 01:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
allocation for it so again the problem
 
01:22:48.470 --> 01:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
we're resolving is the fact that we get
 
01:22:51.030 --> 01:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
too much money um in breakage right now
 
01:22:52.709 --> 01:22:52.719 align:start position:0%
to deal with responsible gaming and I
 
01:22:54.790 --> 01:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
think we just talked about some some
 
01:22:56.709 --> 01:22:56.719 align:start position:0%
fixes to that things like the the
 
01:22:59.390 --> 01:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
Banning and the and the Statewide uh
 
01:23:01.270 --> 01:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
self-exclusion list and ways we can
 
01:23:03.470 --> 01:23:03.480 align:start position:0%
spend some of that money to help benefit
 
01:23:06.149 --> 01:23:06.159 align:start position:0%
the citizens of New Hampshire um and and
 
01:23:08.510 --> 01:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
deal with responsible gaming on a more
 
01:23:11.189 --> 01:23:11.199 align:start position:0%
Statewide process rather than Facility
 
01:23:12.950 --> 01:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
by facility issue which is what we have
 
01:23:15.310 --> 01:23:15.320 align:start position:0%
now so I just want to again other than
 
01:23:17.350 --> 01:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
this one vendor which I think Charlie
 
01:23:19.590 --> 01:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
might have to address but everybody else
 
01:23:22.070 --> 01:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
is playing by the rules and playing by
 
01:23:24.590 --> 01:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
by we have and it's being done exactly
 
01:23:26.189 --> 01:23:26.199 align:start position:0%
the way we intend it the breakage is
 
01:23:28.229 --> 01:23:28.239 align:start position:0%
going for responsible gaming and it's
 
01:23:30.629 --> 01:23:30.639 align:start position:0%
and the value is so high that the the
 
01:23:32.350 --> 01:23:32.360 align:start position:0%
amount that's coming in is higher than
 
01:23:34.390 --> 01:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
what we were budgeted for and we
 
01:23:36.070 --> 01:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
correcting that as well so I just want
 
01:23:37.870 --> 01:23:37.880 align:start position:0%
to Circle it back when we're talking
 
01:23:39.550 --> 01:23:39.560 align:start position:0%
about breakage and responsible gaming
 
01:23:40.950 --> 01:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
how that is all that you're playing
 
01:23:43.030 --> 01:23:43.040 align:start position:0%
together right now I mean I'm happy to
 
01:23:44.550 --> 01:23:44.560 align:start position:0%
just tell the vendor to pull the
 
01:23:47.830 --> 01:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
machines and re reprogram it then those
 
01:23:50.470 --> 01:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
kind off my back just know the the
 
01:23:52.629 --> 01:23:52.639 align:start position:0%
repercussions down the line but that's
 
01:23:55.189 --> 01:23:55.199 align:start position:0%
the only and right I don't want to
 
01:23:58.310 --> 01:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
disrupt anything though so uh that's why
 
01:24:01.030 --> 01:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
we got to we got to come to terms again
 
01:24:03.229 --> 01:24:03.239 align:start position:0%
it's not pressing it is
 
01:24:05.510 --> 01:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
impressing we have until November 1st as
 
01:24:07.149 --> 01:24:07.159 align:start position:0%
a commission I think we have to address
 
01:24:09.830 --> 01:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
it in one way or another uh but I think
 
01:24:11.350 --> 01:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
we need to start the dialogue with this
 
01:24:15.030 --> 01:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
Fender to say you know help us out here
 
01:24:17.070 --> 01:24:17.080 align:start position:0%
uh we have a we have a statute in place
 
01:24:18.830 --> 01:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
that says you know your machines are
 
01:24:21.310 --> 01:24:21.320 align:start position:0%
supposed to be throwing off some um you
 
01:24:25.669 --> 01:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:29.110 --> 01:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't think the statute has any
 
01:24:32.189 --> 01:24:32.199 align:start position:0%
requirement that there be breakage it
 
01:24:33.750 --> 01:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
says if there is
 
01:24:35.950 --> 01:24:35.960 align:start position:0%
breakage then this is what should be
 
01:24:41.950 --> 01:24:41.960 align:start position:0%
done with it so um it's it's open season
 
01:24:44.470 --> 01:24:44.480 align:start position:0%
shall we say shall we have breakage or
 
01:24:49.109 --> 01:24:49.119 align:start position:0%
not the the The Gambler is putting in
 
01:24:53.070 --> 01:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
$100 and um May it back a lot of money
 
01:24:56.310 --> 01:24:56.320 align:start position:0%
or a little money and out of the money
 
01:24:59.430 --> 01:24:59.440 align:start position:0%
that all the gamblers put in there's a
 
01:25:01.990 --> 01:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
satis side we call it a commission I
 
01:25:03.990 --> 01:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
think it's been a while since I've
 
01:25:06.590 --> 01:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
looked at this stuff but uh in any event
 
01:25:10.350 --> 01:25:10.360 align:start position:0%
uh that's where the money go comes from
 
01:25:12.790 --> 01:25:12.800 align:start position:0%
that then goes to the operators and The
 
01:25:14.790 --> 01:25:14.800 align:start position:0%
Operators pay the manufacturers and so
 
01:25:18.430 --> 01:25:18.440 align:start position:0%
forth and uh the state gets some um and
 
01:25:20.109 --> 01:25:20.119 align:start position:0%
the rest of the money is in the pool
 
01:25:24.510 --> 01:25:24.520 align:start position:0%
it's parametrial and uh that includes uh
 
01:25:26.070 --> 01:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
I suppose it includes breakage I'm a
 
01:25:28.350 --> 01:25:28.360 align:start position:0%
little confused about the whole breakage
 
01:25:31.350 --> 01:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
calculations but uh break it that
 
01:25:33.590 --> 01:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
includes break in a sense but maybe
 
01:25:35.310 --> 01:25:35.320 align:start position:0%
maybe that that's gone because they're
 
01:25:37.830 --> 01:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
not they're not handing out pennies
 
01:25:40.830 --> 01:25:40.840 align:start position:0%
anymore they're they're they're using
 
01:25:43.470 --> 01:25:43.480 align:start position:0%
computers and they're they're they've
 
01:25:46.790 --> 01:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
got uh decimal points down to the you
 
01:25:51.629 --> 01:25:51.639 align:start position:0%
know way way out there and uh so um is
 
01:25:55.510 --> 01:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
the the G amblers are getting back more
 
01:25:57.510 --> 01:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
there one way to put it is it's right at
 
01:26:01.109 --> 01:26:01.119 align:start position:0%
the margin but uh I don't I I don't
 
01:26:01.119 --> 01:26:03.229 align:start position:0%
the margin but uh I don't I I don't
understand

01:26:03.229 --> 01:26:03.239 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:26:06.550 --> 01:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
why well why we would be able to require
 
01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:07.470 align:start position:0%
why well why we would be able to require
a

01:26:07.470 --> 01:26:07.480 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:26:10.510 --> 01:26:10.520 align:start position:0%
manufacturer to produce breakage where
 
01:26:12.430 --> 01:26:12.440 align:start position:0%
there's no statutory requirement to
 
01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:13.990 align:start position:0%
there's no statutory requirement to
start

01:26:13.990 --> 01:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
start
 
01:26:17.310 --> 01:26:17.320 align:start position:0%
with well do any statutary thing is that
 
01:26:18.790 --> 01:26:18.800 align:start position:0%
we said we're going to use breakage and
 
01:26:19.950 --> 01:26:19.960 align:start position:0%
that so we're going to have two
 
01:26:22.470 --> 01:26:22.480 align:start position:0%
different systems in place here those
 
01:26:23.910 --> 01:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
that have machines that have breakage
 
01:26:25.590 --> 01:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
and those that don't have
 
01:26:27.510 --> 01:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
breakage so again I don't think it's
 
01:26:28.709 --> 01:26:28.719 align:start position:0%
that they don't have breakage is what
 
01:26:30.350 --> 01:26:30.360 align:start position:0%
they're doing with it right they're
 
01:26:33.070 --> 01:26:33.080 align:start position:0%
rolling it back in versus giving it to
 
01:26:34.709 --> 01:26:34.719 align:start position:0%
the state for the purpose of problem
 
01:26:36.950 --> 01:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
gaming and I think this can be an or
 
01:26:40.070 --> 01:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
addition to legislature right just an or
 
01:26:42.790 --> 01:26:42.800 align:start position:0%
right so we want the operators to pay a
 
01:26:45.510 --> 01:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
certain portion to responsible gaming
 
01:26:47.189 --> 01:26:47.199 align:start position:0%
right that that's not the operators but
 
01:26:48.669 --> 01:26:48.679 align:start position:0%
the manufacturers right that's the whole
 
01:26:50.629 --> 01:26:50.639 align:start position:0%
purpose of breakage is it's breaking the
 
01:26:52.430 --> 01:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
game and we're doing it so it could be
 
01:26:54.990 --> 01:26:55.000 align:start position:0%
or addition to the language it say
 
01:26:57.750 --> 01:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
breakage or manufacturer sh right so
 
01:26:59.870 --> 01:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
they can either submit breakage to the
 
01:27:01.510 --> 01:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
uh to the state to pay for responsible
 
01:27:03.629 --> 01:27:03.639 align:start position:0%
gaming or the manufacturer can submit a
 
01:27:05.870 --> 01:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
fixed fee to the state for problem
 
01:27:07.669 --> 01:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
gaming and that may resolve the issue
 
01:27:09.390 --> 01:27:09.400 align:start position:0%
for us and not for Char to take
 
01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:10.470 align:start position:0%
for us and not for Char to take
something

01:27:10.470 --> 01:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:27:12.550 --> 01:27:12.560 align:start position:0%
offline I mean certainly like I said
 
01:27:14.189 --> 01:27:14.199 align:start position:0%
before I I think you can get to a
 
01:27:15.790 --> 01:27:15.800 align:start position:0%
reasonable number in terms of what that
 
01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:19.990 align:start position:0%
reasonable number in terms of what that
would

01:27:19.990 --> 01:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:28.270 --> 01:27:28.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:30.790 --> 01:27:30.800 align:start position:0%
right no no no no no the sast talking
 
01:27:34.229 --> 01:27:34.239 align:start position:0%
about no that's separate that's no
 
01:27:37.390 --> 01:27:37.400 align:start position:0%
no so there only one place with sast all
 
01:27:38.950 --> 01:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
right enough of this for today on this
 
01:27:43.669 --> 01:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
one um um think about think about it um
 
01:27:45.590 --> 01:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
we'll bring it up again another
 
01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:49.350 align:start position:0%
we'll bring it up again another
meeting

01:27:49.350 --> 01:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:54.149 --> 01:27:54.159 align:start position:0%
um I guess uh posted well number six is
 
01:27:57.109 --> 01:27:57.119 align:start position:0%
postponed U Charlie you still working on
 
01:27:59.590 --> 01:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
that survey uh yeah certainly um
 
01:28:02.790 --> 01:28:02.800 align:start position:0%
received back a proposal from
 
01:28:05.790 --> 01:28:05.800 align:start position:0%
UNH um
 
01:28:08.950 --> 01:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
and UNH is going to do this the
 
01:28:11.550 --> 01:28:11.560 align:start position:0%
survey as many charity emails this week
 
01:28:14.109 --> 01:28:14.119 align:start position:0%
can get I think the proposal had for 575
 
01:28:17.830 --> 01:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
Charities they would ask 15 questions um
 
01:28:19.669 --> 01:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
Andy Smith who I think all of you know
 
01:28:22.030 --> 01:28:22.040 align:start position:0%
of um is going to do the survey his
 
01:28:27.550 --> 01:28:27.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:30.109 --> 01:28:30.119 align:start position:0%
results okay going to sort of Look to
 
01:28:32.990 --> 01:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
Him obviously to You'll all see the
 
01:28:34.070 --> 01:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
questions that are presented but
 
01:28:36.229 --> 01:28:36.239 align:start position:0%
certainly Look to Him to draft the
 
01:28:37.910 --> 01:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
questions to make sure they are
 
01:28:41.070 --> 01:28:41.080 align:start position:0%
objective and professional research
 
01:28:44.990 --> 01:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
questions not sort of otherwise right
 
01:28:46.310 --> 01:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
sometimes the way you frame the question
 
01:28:47.870 --> 01:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
you get it makes a huge difference
 
01:28:49.310 --> 01:28:49.320 align:start position:0%
obviously and this you know he's a
 
01:28:50.470 --> 01:28:50.480 align:start position:0%
professional he's been doing this for a
 
01:28:53.510 --> 01:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
long time so um look to him to start the
 
01:28:56.390 --> 01:28:56.400 align:start position:0%
process and so it's a manual process I'm
 
01:28:59.149 --> 01:28:59.159 align:start position:0%
looking at Val again apologize um
 
01:29:01.109 --> 01:29:01.119 align:start position:0%
because we have to do the emails by hand
 
01:29:03.109 --> 01:29:03.119 align:start position:0%
not by hand but certainly it's there's
 
01:29:04.830 --> 01:29:04.840 align:start position:0%
no database where they can all be loaded
 
01:29:06.550 --> 01:29:06.560 align:start position:0%
it's like have do it one one at a time
 
01:29:09.790 --> 01:29:09.800 align:start position:0%
but it's I think it was 575 I think was
 
01:29:12.550 --> 01:29:12.560 align:start position:0%
the number which obviously n if n equals
 
01:29:15.109 --> 01:29:15.119 align:start position:0%
575 in a survey that's a stat
 
01:29:16.910 --> 01:29:16.920 align:start position:0%
statistically valid
 
01:29:20.950 --> 01:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
survey okay yep was there a timeline for
 
01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:22.669 align:start position:0%
survey okay yep was there a timeline for
that

01:29:22.669 --> 01:29:22.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:29:25.229 --> 01:29:25.239 align:start position:0%
there was it's this spring so I want to
 
01:29:27.590 --> 01:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
say the next couple months and obviously
 
01:29:30.149 --> 01:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
that depends on our efforts with him
 
01:29:33.390 --> 01:29:33.400 align:start position:0%
getting the list and uh the questions so
 
01:29:36.030 --> 01:29:36.040 align:start position:0%
okay and was Andy Smith yes yeah he's
 
01:29:40.070 --> 01:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:43.629 --> 01:29:43.639 align:start position:0%
UNH it was a very reasonable fee so we
 
01:29:45.510 --> 01:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
just included as part of the lottery
 
01:29:47.830 --> 01:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
market research budget I think it was a
 
01:29:50.709 --> 01:29:50.719 align:start position:0%
couple thousand dollars it wasn't
 
01:29:53.510 --> 01:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
much okay so more on that in future
 
01:29:53.520 --> 01:29:56.310 align:start position:0%
much okay so more on that in future
meeting

01:29:56.310 --> 01:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
01:29:58.629 --> 01:29:58.639 align:start position:0%
um Revenue
 
01:29:58.639 --> 01:30:01.149 align:start position:0%
um Revenue
growth

01:30:01.149 --> 01:30:01.159 align:start position:0%
growth
 
01:30:04.510 --> 01:30:04.520 align:start position:0%
um I guess we've been successful here if
 
01:30:06.790 --> 01:30:06.800 align:start position:0%
I could say in terms of the dollars
 
01:30:10.350 --> 01:30:10.360 align:start position:0%
Charlie uh office produced this document
 
01:30:14.470 --> 01:30:14.480 align:start position:0%
which has a lot of good data in it uh by
 
01:30:17.669 --> 01:30:17.679 align:start position:0%
location uh and I'm not going to go over
 
01:30:19.109 --> 01:30:19.119 align:start position:0%
this one specifically unless someone
 
01:30:20.390 --> 01:30:20.400 align:start position:0%
wants to talk about something specific
 
01:30:23.629 --> 01:30:23.639 align:start position:0%
on this sheet that I that was handed out
 
01:30:25.229 --> 01:30:25.239 align:start position:0%
is something I
 
01:30:28.510 --> 01:30:28.520 align:start position:0%
produced uh and the the third the last
 
01:30:30.510 --> 01:30:30.520 align:start position:0%
two columns were based on the data from
 
01:30:33.669 --> 01:30:33.679 align:start position:0%
from here so what I did was I I showed
 
01:30:35.910 --> 01:30:35.920 align:start position:0%
this last meeting and I said we we still
 
01:30:37.669 --> 01:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
don't have this past calendar year now
 
01:30:39.990 --> 01:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
we have the the data from of the
 
01:30:43.910 --> 01:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
calendar year that ended uh in
 
01:30:47.990 --> 01:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
December and we were looking at was like
 
01:30:50.149 --> 01:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
a rolling kind of an average if you will
 
01:30:53.270 --> 01:30:53.280 align:start position:0%
or we looked at last calendar year we
 
01:30:55.910 --> 01:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
looked at the fiscal year 12 months so
 
01:30:57.709 --> 01:30:57.719 align:start position:0%
we looked at 12 months of last calendar
 
01:31:00.709 --> 01:31:00.719 align:start position:0%
year we looked at 12 months again 12
 
01:31:03.430 --> 01:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
months of the fiscal year that ended in
 
01:31:07.270 --> 01:31:07.280 align:start position:0%
uh uh June end of June and then we
 
01:31:09.990 --> 01:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
looked at this calendar year so I had
 
01:31:11.669 --> 01:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
three data points that are all looking
 
01:31:14.350 --> 01:31:14.360 align:start position:0%
at 12 months worth of data okay so if we
 
01:31:16.149 --> 01:31:16.159 align:start position:0%
look at the big numbers on the
 
01:31:20.629 --> 01:31:20.639 align:start position:0%
bottom uh or the total so we were last
 
01:31:22.830 --> 01:31:22.840 align:start position:0%
calendar year
 
01:31:26.149 --> 01:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
total revenues that went to the
 
01:31:27.910 --> 01:31:27.920 align:start position:0%
facilities charities in the state was
 
01:31:29.870 --> 01:31:29.880 align:start position:0%
about 74
 
01:31:32.870 --> 01:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
Million last fiscal year that ended in
 
01:31:36.590 --> 01:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
June June 30th it was like 117
 
01:31:41.350 --> 01:31:41.360 align:start position:0%
million and this calendar year it's that
 
01:31:45.910 --> 01:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
just ended in December about 170 million
 
01:31:48.590 --> 01:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
so if you look at the bottom you know
 
01:31:52.070 --> 01:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
year to year those revenues went between
 
01:31:56.910 --> 01:31:56.920 align:start position:0%
the first two went up 43 million or
 
01:32:00.830 --> 01:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
59.2% but then then between the the
 
01:32:04.270 --> 01:32:04.280 align:start position:0%
fiscal year and the calendar year uh
 
01:32:07.510 --> 01:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
went up another $52 million or another
 
01:32:09.790 --> 01:32:09.800 align:start position:0%
44.9% but in the 12 months just
 
01:32:12.229 --> 01:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
comparing last calendar year to this
 
01:32:14.030 --> 01:32:14.040 align:start position:0%
calendar year that just
 
01:32:17.270 --> 01:32:17.280 align:start position:0%
ended uh we're looking at an increase of
 
01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:18.750 align:start position:0%
ended uh we're looking at an increase of
$96

01:32:18.750 --> 01:32:18.760 align:start position:0%
$96
 
01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:20.669 align:start position:0%
$96
million

01:32:20.669 --> 01:32:20.679 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:32:22.709 --> 01:32:22.719 align:start position:0%
total about
 
01:32:25.870 --> 01:32:25.880 align:start position:0%
13.6% growth in
 
01:32:28.910 --> 01:32:28.920 align:start position:0%
revenues and these were after payouts
 
01:32:30.750 --> 01:32:30.760 align:start position:0%
after everything
 
01:32:33.629 --> 01:32:33.639 align:start position:0%
so uh and that's obviously been driven
 
01:32:36.709 --> 01:32:36.719 align:start position:0%
by a lot by the historic racing machines
 
01:32:38.229 --> 01:32:38.239 align:start position:0%
so we're not surprised that the numbers
 
01:32:41.070 --> 01:32:41.080 align:start position:0%
gone up but what's a little surprising
 
01:32:43.149 --> 01:32:43.159 align:start position:0%
is is when you start looking at the
 
01:32:46.750 --> 01:32:46.760 align:start position:0%
allocation now facility Charities and
 
01:32:50.629 --> 01:32:50.639 align:start position:0%
state everybody's gone up
 
01:32:52.910 --> 01:32:52.920 align:start position:0%
uh I mean the big Winners have been the
 
01:32:54.430 --> 01:32:54.440 align:start position:0%
facilities in the
 
01:32:56.870 --> 01:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
State uh but the Charities if you look
 
01:32:56.880 --> 01:32:58.310 align:start position:0%
State uh but the Charities if you look
at

01:32:58.310 --> 01:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:33:00.910 --> 01:33:00.920 align:start position:0%
percentages uh you know facility started
 
01:33:03.750 --> 01:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
at they got 60.5% of
 
01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:06.310 align:start position:0%
at they got 60.5% of
revenues

01:33:06.310 --> 01:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
01:33:09.750 --> 01:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
60.5% in the middle 12 months it was
 
01:33:12.189 --> 01:33:12.199 align:start position:0%
65.5 and now it's
 
01:33:14.950 --> 01:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
67.7 Charities were at
 
01:33:19.189 --> 01:33:19.199 align:start position:0%
27.9% of the take now they're 21 then
 
01:33:20.350 --> 01:33:20.360 align:start position:0%
then it was
 
01:33:23.430 --> 01:33:23.440 align:start position:0%
21.2% and now they're down to
 
01:33:28.030 --> 01:33:28.040 align:start position:0%
18.3% and the state went up from 11.6%
 
01:33:30.510 --> 01:33:30.520 align:start position:0%
13.3% down to
 
01:33:34.590 --> 01:33:34.600 align:start position:0%
14% so and what's driving that well we
 
01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:35.950 align:start position:0%
14% so and what's driving that well we
have

01:33:35.950 --> 01:33:35.960 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:33:40.430 --> 01:33:40.440 align:start position:0%
different metrics for allocation for the
 
01:33:43.510 --> 01:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
table games than we do for the historic
 
01:33:46.550 --> 01:33:46.560 align:start position:0%
racing machines so as historic racing
 
01:33:49.629 --> 01:33:49.639 align:start position:0%
machines have grown less of the money
 
01:33:50.910 --> 01:33:50.920 align:start position:0%
from historic racing goes to the
 
01:33:53.149 --> 01:33:53.159 align:start position:0%
charities more goes to the state and
 
01:33:58.910 --> 01:33:58.920 align:start position:0%
more goes to the of G goes the game uh
 
01:34:01.149 --> 01:34:01.159 align:start position:0%
operators or the facilities I like to
 
01:34:04.790 --> 01:34:04.800 align:start position:0%
call them so the question on the table
 
01:34:07.830 --> 01:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
is and this is a bigger question that
 
01:34:09.229 --> 01:34:09.239 align:start position:0%
that's part of the reason we're bringing
 
01:34:11.790 --> 01:34:11.800 align:start position:0%
the consultants in uh one of the big
 
01:34:15.229 --> 01:34:15.239 align:start position:0%
questions I want to see answered is is
 
01:34:17.189 --> 01:34:17.199 align:start position:0%
especially especially for the historic
 
01:34:17.199 --> 01:34:18.390 align:start position:0%
especially especially for the historic
racing

01:34:18.390 --> 01:34:18.400 align:start position:0%
racing
 
01:34:21.990 --> 01:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
machines it are the percent allocations
 
01:34:26.070 --> 01:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
reasonable or not uh right now and I
 
01:34:27.950 --> 01:34:27.960 align:start position:0%
know the these things cost me money and
 
01:34:29.510 --> 01:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
all that but then you could say well a
 
01:34:31.669 --> 01:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
roulette wheel takes two or three
 
01:34:35.189 --> 01:34:35.199 align:start position:0%
people uh when it's running uh there's a
 
01:34:38.229 --> 01:34:38.239 align:start position:0%
certain cost there as well to table
 
01:34:43.109 --> 01:34:43.119 align:start position:0%
games um labor costs versus machine
 
01:34:47.550 --> 01:34:47.560 align:start position:0%
costs um and I think to me this is one
 
01:34:48.550 --> 01:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
of the big things we're going to be
 
01:34:51.189 --> 01:34:51.199 align:start position:0%
looking at do we need to fine-tune I
 
01:34:51.199 --> 01:34:52.030 align:start position:0%
looking at do we need to fine-tune I
mean

01:34:52.030 --> 01:34:52.040 align:start position:0%
mean
 
01:34:55.109 --> 01:34:55.119 align:start position:0%
do we need to fine-tune those allocation
 
01:34:59.990 --> 01:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
formulas uh to uh I mean you know when
 
01:35:02.109 --> 01:35:02.119 align:start position:0%
you just look at in whole numbers the
 
01:35:04.510 --> 01:35:04.520 align:start position:0%
the Charities haven't really
 
01:35:07.750 --> 01:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
benefited from from historic racing
 
01:35:10.030 --> 01:35:10.040 align:start position:0%
machines as much as they should from my
 
01:35:12.590 --> 01:35:12.600 align:start position:0%
perspective they used to get 27.9% of
 
01:35:15.270 --> 01:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
the revenues total now they're getting
 
01:35:17.149 --> 01:35:17.159 align:start position:0%
18.3% of
 
01:35:19.550 --> 01:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
revenues um and I don't know I need
 
01:35:21.950 --> 01:35:21.960 align:start position:0%
someone to explain to me
 
01:35:25.790 --> 01:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
is is that okay or not okay and again
 
01:35:28.669 --> 01:35:28.679 align:start position:0%
that's what we're bringing in the uh the
 
01:35:32.709 --> 01:35:32.719 align:start position:0%
lobby the lobbyist the the um
 
01:35:35.390 --> 01:35:35.400 align:start position:0%
Consultants to show us comparisons to
 
01:35:38.030 --> 01:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
other states what's
 
01:35:40.350 --> 01:35:40.360 align:start position:0%
reasonable my
 
01:35:43.149 --> 01:35:43.159 align:start position:0%
friend thank you and that was my point
 
01:35:45.590 --> 01:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
these are the raw numbers yeah and we've
 
01:35:47.550 --> 01:35:47.560 align:start position:0%
both heard testimony relative to the
 
01:35:51.550 --> 01:35:51.560 align:start position:0%
costs associated in running those HHR
 
01:35:55.109 --> 01:35:55.119 align:start position:0%
machines in totality so I'd like to see
 
01:35:58.270 --> 01:35:58.280 align:start position:0%
maybe the operators get involved or
 
01:36:02.750 --> 01:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
something and give us a line item uh
 
01:36:04.310 --> 01:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
listing as
 
01:36:08.149 --> 01:36:08.159 align:start position:0%
to you know this amount came in this is
 
01:36:10.350 --> 01:36:10.360 align:start position:0%
what the costs were associated this cost
 
01:36:13.229 --> 01:36:13.239 align:start position:0%
this cost this cost because we took a
 
01:36:15.350 --> 01:36:15.360 align:start position:0%
lot of that information you you were
 
01:36:17.550 --> 01:36:17.560 align:start position:0%
still on the committee at the time and
 
01:36:21.430 --> 01:36:21.440 align:start position:0%
we came to what the breakdown is now
 
01:36:24.669 --> 01:36:24.679 align:start position:0%
right on its face the way this looks now
 
01:36:26.510 --> 01:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
I couldn't agree with you more it looks
 
01:36:28.990 --> 01:36:29.000 align:start position:0%
like something's something's a miss here
 
01:36:30.390 --> 01:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
but I think we'd need all the
 
01:36:33.590 --> 01:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
information before we start shooting
 
01:36:36.510 --> 01:36:36.520 align:start position:0%
uh shoot shooting down that the the
 
01:36:39.070 --> 01:36:39.080 align:start position:0%
Charities AR getting that you know much
 
01:36:40.270 --> 01:36:40.280 align:start position:0%
benefit from
 
01:36:43.310 --> 01:36:43.320 align:start position:0%
this um I mean just to Echo not Echo
 
01:36:46.070 --> 01:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
that point but certainly to add to it
 
01:36:49.070 --> 01:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
um we're still early in the revenue life
 
01:36:51.229 --> 01:36:51.239 align:start position:0%
cycle uh and there are a number of facil
 
01:36:54.189 --> 01:36:54.199 align:start position:0%
fa ities haven't come online yet and
 
01:36:57.109 --> 01:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
so we're going to see cannibalization
 
01:36:59.070 --> 01:36:59.080 align:start position:0%
sooner rather than later and so I want
 
01:37:01.109 --> 01:37:01.119 align:start position:0%
to know what that looks like before I
 
01:37:02.990 --> 01:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
come up with it also you be you'll be
 
01:37:05.149 --> 01:37:05.159 align:start position:0%
able to know if you go with expenses and
 
01:37:07.430 --> 01:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
revenue now there's no question that's
 
01:37:09.390 --> 01:37:09.400 align:start position:0%
an easy conversation it's an Excel
 
01:37:11.030 --> 01:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet but I don't know what that
 
01:37:12.910 --> 01:37:12.920 align:start position:0%
looks like in a year from now uh in
 
01:37:14.709 --> 01:37:14.719 align:start position:0%
terms of when more facilities come
 
01:37:16.990 --> 01:37:17.000 align:start position:0%
online and they get larger or they move
 
01:37:20.350 --> 01:37:20.360 align:start position:0%
to their soon to be new home etc etc uh
 
01:37:21.669 --> 01:37:21.679 align:start position:0%
that's a different conversation station
 
01:37:24.430 --> 01:37:24.440 align:start position:0%
so um you obviously it's a moving Target
 
01:37:27.950 --> 01:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
OB but um I think it's early but they
 
01:37:30.109 --> 01:37:30.119 align:start position:0%
can but they can look at things like one
 
01:37:31.950 --> 01:37:31.960 align:start position:0%
second friend they can look at things
 
01:37:33.750 --> 01:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
consultant can look at things like how
 
01:37:35.669 --> 01:37:35.679 align:start position:0%
much each well I know you do this too
 
01:37:37.750 --> 01:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
you know for this state how much each
 
01:37:38.950 --> 01:37:38.960 align:start position:0%
machine is
 
01:37:42.870 --> 01:37:42.880 align:start position:0%
producing to pending right okay so is
 
01:37:45.510 --> 01:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
this in the ballpark of what other
 
01:37:47.109 --> 01:37:47.119 align:start position:0%
states are doing with their I mean I
 
01:37:49.510 --> 01:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
know historic racing machines are in
 
01:37:52.830 --> 01:37:52.840 align:start position:0%
theory more costly than blot machines
 
01:37:54.830 --> 01:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
right because you have to pay the fee to
 
01:37:57.070 --> 01:37:57.080 align:start position:0%
the tracks that are producing the
 
01:37:59.870 --> 01:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
historic races as well as I guess other
 
01:38:02.430 --> 01:38:02.440 align:start position:0%
things so but I I I think as a
 
01:38:04.070 --> 01:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
commission this is this is our biggest
 
01:38:06.390 --> 01:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
thing that we got to look at um because
 
01:38:08.310 --> 01:38:08.320 align:start position:0%
the Public's going to ask us i' I've had
 
01:38:11.030 --> 01:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
people call me we had we had X reps
 
01:38:13.189 --> 01:38:13.199 align:start position:0%
around my case about you know we gave it
 
01:38:16.629 --> 01:38:16.639 align:start position:0%
away we gave it away you know so I think
 
01:38:18.470 --> 01:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
this is the time that we have to pause
 
01:38:20.109 --> 01:38:20.119 align:start position:0%
and look at this and say is there a
 
01:38:22.030 --> 01:38:22.040 align:start position:0%
reasonable tweak here that needs to
 
01:38:25.430 --> 01:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
happen and if so what how much right and
 
01:38:28.030 --> 01:38:28.040 align:start position:0%
all I'm saying and I get those calls too
 
01:38:30.310 --> 01:38:30.320 align:start position:0%
is let's have all the information not
 
01:38:32.990 --> 01:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
just the raw data and and get it from
 
01:38:35.350 --> 01:38:35.360 align:start position:0%
multiple sources so nobody's cooking
 
01:38:37.709 --> 01:38:37.719 align:start position:0%
books or or whatever and let's know what
 
01:38:39.669 --> 01:38:39.679 align:start position:0%
electricity costs what the machines cost
 
01:38:42.709 --> 01:38:42.719 align:start position:0%
what's you know licensing fees and on
 
01:38:45.470 --> 01:38:45.480 align:start position:0%
and on and on so comparing Apples to
 
01:38:47.550 --> 01:38:47.560 align:start position:0%
Apples right it's what's behind the
 
01:38:49.790 --> 01:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
numbers it's my whole number my whole
 
01:38:52.589 --> 01:38:52.599 align:start position:0%
career looking at numbers so so I
 
01:38:54.910 --> 01:38:54.920 align:start position:0%
understand that uh the lbers can lie you
 
01:38:56.709 --> 01:38:56.719 align:start position:0%
have to really understand what's going
 
01:38:59.510 --> 01:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
on and that's again we that's one of the
 
01:39:01.030 --> 01:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
big reasons we brought the consultant we
 
01:39:02.830 --> 01:39:02.840 align:start position:0%
were bring in the consultant to do some
 
01:39:05.270 --> 01:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
of that back
 
01:39:08.470 --> 01:39:08.480 align:start position:0%
room stuff and their experience at other
 
01:39:11.830 --> 01:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
states to say y this about right or not
 
01:39:14.589 --> 01:39:14.599 align:start position:0%
right and I'd like to hear
 
01:39:17.990 --> 01:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
that so again I am I look at these
 
01:39:19.750 --> 01:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
numbers I'm using the first the first
 
01:39:21.950 --> 01:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
column and the third column years or
 
01:39:24.750 --> 01:39:24.760 align:start position:0%
data for data um and you're seeing that
 
01:39:26.750 --> 01:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
the operators saw a 50% increase in
 
01:39:29.149 --> 01:39:29.159 align:start position:0%
Revenue right not in 18 you know they
 
01:39:31.709 --> 01:39:31.719 align:start position:0%
went from 20 million to 31 million right
 
01:39:32.750 --> 01:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
I mean not the operators but the
 
01:39:35.310 --> 01:39:35.320 align:start position:0%
Charities went from 20 million to 31
 
01:39:38.030 --> 01:39:38.040 align:start position:0%
million a 50% increase in Revenue to
 
01:39:40.950 --> 01:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
charities in just in one calendar year
 
01:39:42.950 --> 01:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
um and you see a little bit bigger gain
 
01:39:44.750 --> 01:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
in the in the operators in that same
 
01:39:48.350 --> 01:39:48.360 align:start position:0%
calendar year but again I I look at you
 
01:39:50.229 --> 01:39:50.239 align:start position:0%
know I I've gone to a couple of
 
01:39:52.070 --> 01:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
facilities that tour for them and the
 
01:39:54.589 --> 01:39:54.599 align:start position:0%
amount of capital infrastructure costs
 
01:39:57.270 --> 01:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
that they put in um to to gain that
 
01:39:58.669 --> 01:39:58.679 align:start position:0%
remember the Charities don't have that
 
01:40:01.470 --> 01:40:01.480 align:start position:0%
capital expenditure um that they don't
 
01:40:02.709 --> 01:40:02.719 align:start position:0%
they don't have to put out so when
 
01:40:05.070 --> 01:40:05.080 align:start position:0%
you're looking at things like the brook
 
01:40:08.709 --> 01:40:08.719 align:start position:0%
or or or gate gay Casino or the Moose um
 
01:40:10.470 --> 01:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
the amount of capital expenditure that
 
01:40:12.350 --> 01:40:12.360 align:start position:0%
goes in behind that that create these
 
01:40:14.310 --> 01:40:14.320 align:start position:0%
Revenue gains there still an ongoing
 
01:40:16.950 --> 01:40:16.960 align:start position:0%
cost for the operators um so I don't I
 
01:40:18.470 --> 01:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
just want to be careful we we don't
 
01:40:20.629 --> 01:40:20.639 align:start position:0%
demonize The Operators here at the same
 
01:40:22.390 --> 01:40:22.400 align:start position:0%
point understanding that there's Capital
 
01:40:25.430 --> 01:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
expenditures that go behind that raise
 
01:40:29.149 --> 01:40:29.159 align:start position:0%
charity revenues by 50% in one year is
 
01:40:31.310 --> 01:40:31.320 align:start position:0%
because of their investment Capital
 
01:40:34.550 --> 01:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
Improvements in their facilities um and
 
01:40:37.109 --> 01:40:37.119 align:start position:0%
that to expand for HHR in this
 
01:40:39.470 --> 01:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
particular case uh so I think it's
 
01:40:41.070 --> 01:40:41.080 align:start position:0%
really cognizant that we think about
 
01:40:42.310 --> 01:40:42.320 align:start position:0%
that that that there's Capital
 
01:40:44.149 --> 01:40:44.159 align:start position:0%
expenditures behind this that are
 
01:40:46.629 --> 01:40:46.639 align:start position:0%
long-term debt in most cases that they
 
01:40:48.109 --> 01:40:48.119 align:start position:0%
they've put some capital in but they've
 
01:40:50.270 --> 01:40:50.280 align:start position:0%
also incurred debt that they have to pay
 
01:40:51.669 --> 01:40:51.679 align:start position:0%
off longterm
 
01:40:54.109 --> 01:40:54.119 align:start position:0%
um and so I I I you know the businessman
 
01:40:55.910 --> 01:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
and me promoting my own business hold on
 
01:40:58.070 --> 01:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
a second here it's not all profit right
 
01:40:59.750 --> 01:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
they're they're in order to get those
 
01:41:02.070 --> 01:41:02.080 align:start position:0%
those that 50% gain that the again the
 
01:41:05.709 --> 01:41:05.719 align:start position:0%
Charities saw no exposure to right they
 
01:41:08.550 --> 01:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
see Zero exposure they just see a 50%
 
01:41:11.189 --> 01:41:11.199 align:start position:0%
increase in Revenue because the
 
01:41:13.390 --> 01:41:13.400 align:start position:0%
operators expended the capital funds to
 
01:41:15.149 --> 01:41:15.159 align:start position:0%
do what they were doing so I want to be
 
01:41:16.550 --> 01:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
a little careful here when we talk about
 
01:41:18.030 --> 01:41:18.040 align:start position:0%
this so we don't demonize anybody say
 
01:41:20.430 --> 01:41:20.440 align:start position:0%
someone's getting a sweetheart deal here
 
01:41:22.550 --> 01:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
understanding demonizing anybody we are
 
01:41:24.270 --> 01:41:24.280 align:start position:0%
saying it's now time to pause and to
 
01:41:27.310 --> 01:41:27.320 align:start position:0%
look at the numbers but facilities their
 
01:41:30.229 --> 01:41:30.239 align:start position:0%
growth in Revenue just hard numbers
 
01:41:32.910 --> 01:41:32.920 align:start position:0%
161% and Charities
 
01:41:38.189 --> 01:41:38.199 align:start position:0%
61% so uh that's what I see here um and
 
01:41:41.070 --> 01:41:41.080 align:start position:0%
again it could all be justified it could
 
01:41:43.550 --> 01:41:43.560 align:start position:0%
all be justified but we're done as a
 
01:41:46.390 --> 01:41:46.400 align:start position:0%
commission I want us all to say someone
 
01:41:49.109 --> 01:41:49.119 align:start position:0%
stops me in the street and says is this
 
01:41:51.510 --> 01:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
a fair allocation and you may get
 
01:41:53.950 --> 01:41:53.960 align:start position:0%
stopped too we want to say yes this is
 
01:41:55.709 --> 01:41:55.719 align:start position:0%
what we did to look at it and we are
 
01:41:57.790 --> 01:41:57.800 align:start position:0%
convinced that this is the correct
 
01:42:01.709 --> 01:42:01.719 align:start position:0%
allocation that's all and uh and uh you
 
01:42:03.390 --> 01:42:03.400 align:start position:0%
know we'll work with everybody to make
 
01:42:06.189 --> 01:42:06.199 align:start position:0%
sure it's fair and all that but this is
 
01:42:10.189 --> 01:42:10.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:10.199 --> 01:42:13.310 align:start position:0%
 
that

01:42:13.310 --> 01:42:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:15.550 --> 01:42:15.560 align:start position:0%
else I agree with everything you said
 
01:42:18.310 --> 01:42:18.320 align:start position:0%
and I I think with reference to c l we
 
01:42:21.669 --> 01:42:21.679 align:start position:0%
don't want to deep iniz anybody that's a
 
01:42:23.950 --> 01:42:23.960 align:start position:0%
that's a waste of all our time what we
 
01:42:27.750 --> 01:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
want to come up with is a r rational way
 
01:42:30.550 --> 01:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
to to make to make a good thing to
 
01:42:32.669 --> 01:42:32.679 align:start position:0%
retain a good thing because the
 
01:42:36.550 --> 01:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
Charities the Charities cannot from my
 
01:42:38.470 --> 01:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
stpoint now this is what I hear from the
 
01:42:41.109 --> 01:42:41.119 align:start position:0%
Charities and I see him in I see him in
 
01:42:44.229 --> 01:42:44.239 align:start position:0%
the local bre breakfast place Franco on
 
01:42:46.550 --> 01:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
the west side of Manchester all right
 
01:42:48.669 --> 01:42:48.679 align:start position:0%
where you can still get breakfast for a
 
01:42:51.189 --> 01:42:51.199 align:start position:0%
couple of bucks and we you know they
 
01:42:53.270 --> 01:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
they got the little Cod for the free L
 
01:42:56.310 --> 01:42:56.320 align:start position:0%
for the free one we we stamping they
 
01:42:56.320 --> 01:42:57.669 align:start position:0%
for the free one we we stamping they
they're

01:42:57.669 --> 01:42:57.679 align:start position:0%
they're
 
01:43:02.510 --> 01:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
gamblers uh and they see their their
 
01:43:04.870 --> 01:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
charity and that's that's what they're
 
01:43:08.750 --> 01:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
laying would be the positive Natures of
 
01:43:10.510 --> 01:43:10.520 align:start position:0%
boy the charity needs this the charity
 
01:43:13.589 --> 01:43:13.599 align:start position:0%
needs that because the old ways of the
 
01:43:16.350 --> 01:43:16.360 align:start position:0%
second collections out guys let me tell
 
01:43:18.550 --> 01:43:18.560 align:start position:0%
you the second collection's
 
01:43:23.270 --> 01:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
out and the 25 c seat fee that's good
 
01:43:25.750 --> 01:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
too so where are the where's the money
 
01:43:29.830 --> 01:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
coming from right now this is it this is
 
01:43:30.910 --> 01:43:30.920 align:start position:0%
it for
 
01:43:33.350 --> 01:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
Charities so we want to make sure that
 
01:43:35.830 --> 01:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
everything is on the on it's a square
 
01:43:37.950 --> 01:43:37.960 align:start position:0%
deal for everybody that that that's all
 
01:43:40.990 --> 01:43:41.000 align:start position:0%
good I mean that i' I've been I've been
 
01:43:44.270 --> 01:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
in the business for a long time and
 
01:43:47.030 --> 01:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh I I know what I know the value of a
 
01:43:49.550 --> 01:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
license I know the value of that and
 
01:43:52.229 --> 01:43:52.239 align:start position:0%
we've we've certainly
 
01:43:54.750 --> 01:43:54.760 align:start position:0%
uh have a situation there that I think
 
01:43:58.070 --> 01:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
we have to deal with as as as this
 
01:44:00.950 --> 01:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
thing rotates on but but I think we want
 
01:44:03.229 --> 01:44:03.239 align:start position:0%
to do the best for for everybody that's
 
01:44:05.470 --> 01:44:05.480 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying had represent Janan
 
01:44:05.480 --> 01:44:09.149 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying had represent Janan
first

01:44:09.149 --> 01:44:09.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:11.709 --> 01:44:11.719 align:start position:0%
u i I just have a question if someone
 
01:44:14.350 --> 01:44:14.360 align:start position:0%
can answer how historically that those
 
01:44:18.070 --> 01:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
original percentages for HHR allocation
 
01:44:19.470 --> 01:44:19.480 align:start position:0%
uh came about because they must have
 
01:44:22.629 --> 01:44:22.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:27.030 --> 01:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
calculation um certainly the percentages
 
01:44:30.310 --> 01:44:30.320 align:start position:0%
related to how much would be the
 
01:44:32.790 --> 01:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
operators would get how much other would
 
01:44:34.990 --> 01:44:35.000 align:start position:0%
get State and Charities was get was
 
01:44:36.709 --> 01:44:36.719 align:start position:0%
negotiated at Ways and Means the
 
01:44:39.750 --> 01:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
original Bill had a
 
01:44:44.310 --> 01:44:44.320 align:start position:0%
12% to to the state and Charities and we
 
01:44:46.390 --> 01:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
negotiated up to
 
01:44:50.550 --> 01:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
25% um and we based it on in our fiscal
 
01:44:55.229 --> 01:44:55.239 align:start position:0%
note was a rate of $150 per machine and
 
01:44:57.750 --> 01:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
I think 1,500 machines Statewide I think
 
01:44:59.030 --> 01:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
guess we thought we thought the state
 
01:45:01.070 --> 01:45:01.080 align:start position:0%
would be the amount of machines the
 
01:45:03.149 --> 01:45:03.159 align:start position:0%
state could have and then what what they
 
01:45:05.270 --> 01:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
would make per machine that was what it
 
01:45:08.310 --> 01:45:08.320 align:start position:0%
was based on um obviously there are more
 
01:45:09.870 --> 01:45:09.880 align:start position:0%
than that I think they're not quite I
 
01:45:10.870 --> 01:45:10.880 align:start position:0%
think it's
 
01:45:13.669 --> 01:45:13.679 align:start position:0%
1950 in the state and they're doing much
 
01:45:15.790 --> 01:45:15.800 align:start position:0%
more than $150 a machine I think they're
 
01:45:20.149 --> 01:45:20.159 align:start position:0%
at two something so our estimates were
 
01:45:23.070 --> 01:45:23.080 align:start position:0%
as often are
 
01:45:26.350 --> 01:45:26.360 align:start position:0%
conservative so follow up I I agree that
 
01:45:27.910 --> 01:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
you know with the the statements about
 
01:45:29.550 --> 01:45:29.560 align:start position:0%
we need the data we can't make a final
 
01:45:31.390 --> 01:45:31.400 align:start position:0%
decision without data but it sounds like
 
01:45:35.229 --> 01:45:35.239 align:start position:0%
some of the initial uh premises maybe
 
01:45:38.189 --> 01:45:38.199 align:start position:0%
may have changed with theity of data and
 
01:45:41.070 --> 01:45:41.080 align:start position:0%
we'll get more data to
 
01:45:44.109 --> 01:45:44.119 align:start position:0%
see represent
 
01:45:46.669 --> 01:45:46.679 align:start position:0%
Senator I just want to say that I think
 
01:45:48.430 --> 01:45:48.440 align:start position:0%
this is great good
 
01:45:51.470 --> 01:45:51.480 align:start position:0%
work but it begs a lot lot of questions
 
01:45:53.270 --> 01:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
that's the idea and that's I I want to
 
01:45:57.109 --> 01:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
reinforce that point uh we're on track
 
01:46:00.470 --> 01:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
and we were hiring um an entity that
 
01:46:03.550 --> 01:46:03.560 align:start position:0%
will help us you know get a detail like
 
01:46:05.709 --> 01:46:05.719 align:start position:0%
this and uh I really see the true
 
01:46:09.510 --> 01:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
picture this this uh as I understand it
 
01:46:11.070 --> 01:46:11.080 align:start position:0%
on the screen sheet
 
01:46:14.750 --> 01:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
includes um historical horse racing but
 
01:46:17.750 --> 01:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
also includes the other games of champ
 
01:46:20.589 --> 01:46:20.599 align:start position:0%
CH so this isn't just a picture of what
 
01:46:22.430 --> 01:46:22.440 align:start position:0%
happened with historic horse racing it's
 
01:46:24.950 --> 01:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
a picture of the whole we need obviously
 
01:46:28.030 --> 01:46:28.040 align:start position:0%
need to look beneath that so thanks for
 
01:46:30.350 --> 01:46:30.360 align:start position:0%
for down this path if you look at this
 
01:46:32.830 --> 01:46:32.840 align:start position:0%
document you can you could find these
 
01:46:36.149 --> 01:46:36.159 align:start position:0%
numbers yeah yeah you can see that yeah
 
01:46:37.910 --> 01:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
so this document let talk about this
 
01:46:40.109 --> 01:46:40.119 align:start position:0%
yeah this wasn't created for this this
 
01:46:42.990 --> 01:46:43.000 align:start position:0%
is done by our regularly so this is not
 
01:46:45.709 --> 01:46:45.719 align:start position:0%
just this we do this every three month
 
01:46:48.350 --> 01:46:48.360 align:start position:0%
so it's a very a lot of detail here it's
 
01:46:51.070 --> 01:46:51.080 align:start position:0%
really good uh senator did just a quick
 
01:46:52.750 --> 01:46:52.760 align:start position:0%
window out to answer representative
 
01:46:55.830 --> 01:46:55.840 align:start position:0%
question Bob Odell was chairman of ways
 
01:46:57.669 --> 01:46:57.679 align:start position:0%
and means of the Senate a number of
 
01:47:01.229 --> 01:47:01.239 align:start position:0%
years ago he put together or we put
 
01:47:03.390 --> 01:47:03.400 align:start position:0%
together at the time the original
 
01:47:05.550 --> 01:47:05.560 align:start position:0%
legislation that that granted the
 
01:47:07.070 --> 01:47:07.080 align:start position:0%
dollars the dollar amounts and the
 
01:47:08.990 --> 01:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
percentages and so forth and that was
 
01:47:11.870 --> 01:47:11.880 align:start position:0%
agreed upon by everybody at at the time
 
01:47:14.310 --> 01:47:14.320 align:start position:0%
we didn't have historic hor racing at at
 
01:47:16.950 --> 01:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
the time but we had just about
 
01:47:19.310 --> 01:47:19.320 align:start position:0%
everything else and and the
 
01:47:23.149 --> 01:47:23.159 align:start position:0%
charities 35% was the key was the key
 
01:47:24.709 --> 01:47:24.719 align:start position:0%
issue now how that was ascertained
 
01:47:26.910 --> 01:47:26.920 align:start position:0%
becomes problematic because he didn't
 
01:47:29.229 --> 01:47:29.239 align:start position:0%
know about the rent and so forth and so
 
01:47:33.390 --> 01:47:33.400 align:start position:0%
on but Odell's program was accepted by
 
01:47:35.270 --> 01:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
both the house and the Senate it passed
 
01:47:38.229 --> 01:47:38.239 align:start position:0%
and we drove on that for for for a few
 
01:47:41.189 --> 01:47:41.199 align:start position:0%
years uh and and now subsequently
 
01:47:43.950 --> 01:47:43.960 align:start position:0%
changes have been made uh percentages
 
01:47:46.950 --> 01:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
have been adjusted but the basic premise
 
01:47:49.790 --> 01:47:49.800 align:start position:0%
has always been the 35% for the for the
 
01:47:51.470 --> 01:47:51.480 align:start position:0%
charity I don't think that's changee has
 
01:47:51.480 --> 01:47:52.790 align:start position:0%
charity I don't think that's changee has
it

01:47:52.790 --> 01:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:47:55.350 --> 01:47:55.360 align:start position:0%
sound I mean it's it's less because you
 
01:47:57.669 --> 01:47:57.679 align:start position:0%
take rent out so that that there's a and
 
01:48:00.109 --> 01:48:00.119 align:start position:0%
that varies but yeah it's three but that
 
01:48:02.950 --> 01:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
that was the basis of of of this that
 
01:48:04.750 --> 01:48:04.760 align:start position:0%
seems to be about right right and I just
 
01:48:06.430 --> 01:48:06.440 align:start position:0%
keep going back to it because I happened
 
01:48:08.390 --> 01:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
to be on the committee at the time but
 
01:48:11.910 --> 01:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
we worked when we worked on on this
 
01:48:13.870 --> 01:48:13.880 align:start position:0%
but times have
 
01:48:16.669 --> 01:48:16.679 align:start position:0%
changed the G the game the game has
 
01:48:19.669 --> 01:48:19.679 align:start position:0%
changed the time the time that you when
 
01:48:22.430 --> 01:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
you can perform form the activity has
 
01:48:24.709 --> 01:48:24.719 align:start position:0%
now become 8:00 in the morning till 3:00
 
01:48:27.910 --> 01:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
in the next morning right in in those we
 
01:48:30.149 --> 01:48:30.159 align:start position:0%
originally did this they opened up did
 
01:48:33.870 --> 01:48:33.880 align:start position:0%
they open up at noon I I you know it was
 
01:48:36.589 --> 01:48:36.599 align:start position:0%
and it was a very short span of time
 
01:48:38.270 --> 01:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
where where all of this was was
 
01:48:41.390 --> 01:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
conducted so there's what I'm saying is
 
01:48:43.109 --> 01:48:43.119 align:start position:0%
dramatic changes have taken place and
 
01:48:44.790 --> 01:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
they have to be looked at this is an
 
01:48:46.669 --> 01:48:46.679 align:start position:0%
indication of the dramatic changes that
 
01:48:48.750 --> 01:48:48.760 align:start position:0%
have taken place just the numbers used
 
01:48:51.830 --> 01:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
to be a $4 bet now it's what 5050 we got
 
01:48:54.870 --> 01:48:54.880 align:start position:0%
the $10 B we got this this and so forth
 
01:48:57.229 --> 01:48:57.239 align:start position:0%
and so on but I think the this is the
 
01:49:00.350 --> 01:49:00.360 align:start position:0%
most significant is the time change 8:00
 
01:49:02.910 --> 01:49:02.920 align:start position:0%
in the morning until day the daylight
 
01:49:04.589 --> 01:49:04.599 align:start position:0%
hours of the next morning I know we did
 
01:49:08.390 --> 01:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
that my last term I can't remember but
 
01:49:09.790 --> 01:49:09.800 align:start position:0%
we left it up to the facility
 
01:49:11.669 --> 01:49:11.679 align:start position:0%
interesting enough a lot of facilities
 
01:49:14.149 --> 01:49:14.159 align:start position:0%
didn't go to the maximum because there
 
01:49:15.629 --> 01:49:15.639 align:start position:0%
was none of traffic to make it worth
 
01:49:19.109 --> 01:49:19.119 align:start position:0%
their while to stay open that late did
 
01:49:22.600 --> 01:49:22.610 align:start position:0%
did NASA what did you guys
 
01:49:22.610 --> 01:49:37.950 align:start position:0%
did NASA what did you guys
[Music]

01:49:37.950 --> 01:49:37.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:41.790 --> 01:49:41.800 align:start position:0%
realiz right but do you uh would
 
01:49:45.109 --> 01:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:48.080 align:start position:0%
or that's one
 
01:49:50.669 --> 01:49:50.679 align:start position:0%
okay because the the bar well you can't
 
01:49:52.709 --> 01:49:52.719 align:start position:0%
serve after 1 o' I forget now you can't
 
01:49:57.149 --> 01:49:57.159 align:start position:0%
serve liquor here after 1 o00
 
01:49:57.159 --> 01:49:58.669 align:start position:0%
serve liquor here after 1 o00
huh

01:49:58.669 --> 01:49:58.679 align:start position:0%
huh
 
01:50:02.990 --> 01:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:05.270 --> 01:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
too see I'm had a let s for a year
 
01:50:11.229 --> 01:50:11.239 align:start position:0%
thanks J so okay um great uh everybody
 
01:50:12.870 --> 01:50:12.880 align:start position:0%
any other comments on
 
01:50:15.870 --> 01:50:15.880 align:start position:0%
this yeah I I would suggest going
 
01:50:18.030 --> 01:50:18.040 align:start position:0%
through this offline would be great
 
01:50:20.149 --> 01:50:20.159 align:start position:0%
because really is some interesting data
 
01:50:23.709 --> 01:50:23.719 align:start position:0%
but it I know technically all of these
 
01:50:26.510 --> 01:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
facilities are small compared to uh you
 
01:50:26.520 --> 01:50:27.709 align:start position:0%
facilities are small compared to uh you
know

01:50:27.709 --> 01:50:27.719 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:50:31.669 --> 01:50:31.679 align:start position:0%
Encore uh but there really is a range of
 
01:50:34.709 --> 01:50:34.719 align:start position:0%
size here you can see in the numbers um
 
01:50:38.350 --> 01:50:38.360 align:start position:0%
as well so uh the last thing and before
 
01:50:39.790 --> 01:50:39.800 align:start position:0%
we come out try to come up with another
 
01:50:43.990 --> 01:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
date is uh I to spend five minutes each
 
01:50:45.430 --> 01:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
I'll look who wants to go first the
 
01:50:47.830 --> 01:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
senator or the house but we'll let the
 
01:50:50.270 --> 01:50:50.280 align:start position:0%
house go first about existing bills that
 
01:50:53.669 --> 01:50:53.679 align:start position:0%

01:50:58.149 --> 01:50:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:01.589 --> 01:51:01.599 align:start position:0%

bable gaming yeah yeah um got a bill
 
01:51:07.790 --> 01:51:07.800 align:start position:0%

01:51:10.350 --> 01:51:10.360 align:start position:0%
that went to Senate Bill 112 with the
 
01:51:13.910 --> 01:51:13.920 align:start position:0%

uh in relation to poker in these rooms
 
01:51:29.229 --> 01:51:29.239 align:start position:0%

we just as a notice requirement for
 
01:54:42.510 --> 01:54:42.520 align:start position:0%
lottery to to send out uh notices when
 
01:54:45.270 --> 01:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
when a license is due to expire which we
 
01:54:48.350 --> 01:54:48.360 align:start position:0%
uh recommended out of pass as amended um
 
01:54:52.270 --> 01:54:52.280 align:start position:0%
we have an adud dation bill of lose that
 
01:54:56.669 --> 01:54:56.679 align:start position:0%
um had to do with should the um finding
 
01:54:59.589 --> 01:54:59.599 align:start position:0%
entity also be the adjudication entity
 
01:55:02.229 --> 01:55:02.239 align:start position:0%
um in the purpose for the purpose of of
 
01:55:04.709 --> 01:55:04.719 align:start position:0%
infractions um we been an inter study on
 
01:55:05.950 --> 01:55:05.960 align:start position:0%
that because we think that's a bigger
 
01:55:09.310 --> 01:55:09.320 align:start position:0%
Statewide discussion involving Dees and
 
01:55:10.870 --> 01:55:10.880 align:start position:0%
weights and measures and you name the
 
01:55:13.270 --> 01:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
agency who also finds and then decides
 
01:55:15.069 --> 01:55:15.079 align:start position:0%
to also play judge as well we think
 
01:55:16.310 --> 01:55:16.320 align:start position:0%
that's a bigger discussion the state
 
01:55:18.390 --> 01:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
needs to have so we interim studied that
 
01:55:23.390 --> 01:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
bill um we we have a bill on um uh uh
 
01:55:26.709 --> 01:55:26.719 align:start position:0%
repealing simoc cast dog racing um we
 
01:55:28.750 --> 01:55:28.760 align:start position:0%
are recommending otpa we're pushing that
 
01:55:30.310 --> 01:55:30.320 align:start position:0%
out three years there are only two
 
01:55:32.149 --> 01:55:32.159 align:start position:0%
entities in the state that currently are
 
01:55:34.629 --> 01:55:34.639 align:start position:0%
grandfathered in for dog racing we want
 
01:55:36.350 --> 01:55:36.360 align:start position:0%
to give them time
 
01:55:38.990 --> 01:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
to wind that down rather than just cut
 
01:55:42.109 --> 01:55:42.119 align:start position:0%
them up so we gave we uh we back up you
 
01:55:44.790 --> 01:55:44.800 align:start position:0%
did do we're going to do away with dog
 
01:55:48.830 --> 01:55:48.840 align:start position:0%
dog simult dog racing dog racing only uh
 
01:55:52.149 --> 01:55:52.159 align:start position:0%
simal gas dog some people don't like so
 
01:55:54.790 --> 01:55:54.800 align:start position:0%
um it's a threeyear push out I believe
 
01:55:56.629 --> 01:55:56.639 align:start position:0%
um is what we did to give there's only
 
01:55:58.270 --> 01:55:58.280 align:start position:0%
one entity that that currently does it
 
01:56:01.510 --> 01:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
it's a $900,000 hit to that one entity
 
01:56:03.189 --> 01:56:03.199 align:start position:0%
um and so we want to give them time to
 
01:56:05.430 --> 01:56:05.440 align:start position:0%
phase that in and ramp that in and work
 
01:56:08.270 --> 01:56:08.280 align:start position:0%
with that um those betters May bet on
 
01:56:10.470 --> 01:56:10.480 align:start position:0%
horse racing what's that they may they
 
01:56:13.310 --> 01:56:13.320 align:start position:0%
may they may just shift but the problem
 
01:56:16.350 --> 01:56:16.360 align:start position:0%
is that there are some employees that
 
01:56:18.390 --> 01:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
work just that industry and know that
 
01:56:20.030 --> 01:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
industry that help better on that
 
01:56:21.750 --> 01:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
industry and we want to give them time
 
01:56:24.069 --> 01:56:24.079 align:start position:0%
to train and do things for those
 
01:56:26.709 --> 01:56:26.719 align:start position:0%
employees um we have the return of the
 
01:56:28.750 --> 01:56:28.760 align:start position:0%
advanced deposit wagering which is the
 
01:56:31.750 --> 01:56:31.760 align:start position:0%
online horse betting Bill coming back uh
 
01:56:34.030 --> 01:56:34.040 align:start position:0%
we currently allow Off Track Betting in
 
01:56:35.310 --> 01:56:35.320 align:start position:0%
person but we don't allow off trck
 
01:56:38.189 --> 01:56:38.199 align:start position:0%
betting remote um it's to clean up that
 
01:56:39.550 --> 01:56:39.560 align:start position:0%
language because there's some federal
 
01:56:41.390 --> 01:56:41.400 align:start position:0%
statute that says yes we can some State
 
01:56:43.629 --> 01:56:43.639 align:start position:0%
Statute that's unclear that bill will be
 
01:56:46.149 --> 01:56:46.159 align:start position:0%
coming back um we have not exec that
 
01:56:52.229 --> 01:56:52.239 align:start position:0%
bill yet um we have um um the the return
 
01:56:54.470 --> 01:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
of the historic horse racing with the
 
01:56:56.750 --> 01:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
additive licenses with the moratorium
 
01:56:59.270 --> 01:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
that's a sevene bill I'll be Shifting
 
01:57:02.589 --> 01:57:02.599 align:start position:0%
the municipal um host language into that
 
01:57:06.109 --> 01:57:06.119 align:start position:0%
bill um allowing for 10 days uh based on
 
01:57:09.470 --> 01:57:09.480 align:start position:0%
that bill um we would be adding sorry I
 
01:57:12.270 --> 01:57:12.280 align:start position:0%
did my math over here somewhere um
 
01:57:13.910 --> 01:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
another we'd have end up with over
 
01:57:16.910 --> 01:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
14,000 days of of charitable gaming
 
01:57:18.430 --> 01:57:18.440 align:start position:0%
available in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:57:21.069 --> 01:57:21.079 align:start position:0%
with 20 licensed op operators um that
 
01:57:23.669 --> 01:57:23.679 align:start position:0%
could do two Charities per day one for
 
01:57:25.709 --> 01:57:25.719 align:start position:0%
gaming operat one for games a chance and
 
01:57:28.109 --> 01:57:28.119 align:start position:0%
one for um so it turns out to be over
 
01:57:30.629 --> 01:57:30.639 align:start position:0%
14,000 days we're asking for 200 those
 
01:57:33.270 --> 01:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
days to go to the towns to um help
 
01:57:35.430 --> 01:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
offset local Municipal costs and lower
 
01:57:38.270 --> 01:57:38.280 align:start position:0%
property taxes um so that bill will be
 
01:57:40.709 --> 01:57:40.719 align:start position:0%
being heard um it's been heard we're
 
01:57:43.750 --> 01:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
working through amendments um we have a
 
01:57:46.350 --> 01:57:46.360 align:start position:0%
bill on unclaimed horse uh historic
 
01:57:49.229 --> 01:57:49.239 align:start position:0%
horse racing voucher tickets um there's
 
01:57:49.239 --> 01:57:50.030 align:start position:0%
horse racing voucher tickets um there's
a

01:57:50.030 --> 01:57:50.040 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:57:53.189 --> 01:57:53.199 align:start position:0%
a weird Gap in the law where um
 
01:57:54.629 --> 01:57:54.639 align:start position:0%
unclaimed horse racing tickets don't
 
01:57:57.270 --> 01:57:57.280 align:start position:0%
have a name associated with it and so
 
01:57:59.350 --> 01:57:59.360 align:start position:0%
you get a ticket it's for you know you
 
01:58:01.510 --> 01:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
played your bet all day long and you get
 
01:58:03.629 --> 01:58:03.639 align:start position:0%
your your voucher at the end it's for $2
 
01:58:05.910 --> 01:58:05.920 align:start position:0%
and you don't go to the cage and cash it
 
01:58:08.830 --> 01:58:08.840 align:start position:0%
what happens to that $2 x c um there's
 
01:58:11.189 --> 01:58:11.199 align:start position:0%
no name right now it goes they would
 
01:58:12.669 --> 01:58:12.679 align:start position:0%
have to be submitted as individual
 
01:58:15.470 --> 01:58:15.480 align:start position:0%
receipts to the treasury who would then
 
01:58:17.709 --> 01:58:17.719 align:start position:0%
hold it for another two three years with
 
01:58:20.310 --> 01:58:20.320 align:start position:0%
an unclaimed unknown person to go claim
 
01:58:22.950 --> 01:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
their $2 and whatever cents um it seems
 
01:58:24.990 --> 01:58:25.000 align:start position:0%
like a huge administrative burden so
 
01:58:27.069 --> 01:58:27.079 align:start position:0%
what we're going to do is basically
 
01:58:30.350 --> 01:58:30.360 align:start position:0%
allow the um gaming operators will
 
01:58:32.870 --> 01:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
submit once once a year a check to the
 
01:58:34.109 --> 01:58:34.119 align:start position:0%
treasurer to go to the governor's
 
01:58:36.270 --> 01:58:36.280 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund for all the money and
 
01:58:37.870 --> 01:58:37.880 align:start position:0%
it'll just be directly deposited because
 
01:58:39.270 --> 01:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
you can't put it to a name there's no
 
01:58:41.790 --> 01:58:41.800 align:start position:0%
way for someone to claim that money so
 
01:58:43.069 --> 01:58:43.079 align:start position:0%
that money will just go to the governor
 
01:58:44.910 --> 01:58:44.920 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund to support higher
 
01:58:46.390 --> 01:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
education here in the state of New
 
01:58:48.430 --> 01:58:48.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is that a carrier for when we
 
01:58:49.950 --> 01:58:49.960 align:start position:0%
have real hor racing
 
01:58:51.950 --> 01:58:51.960 align:start position:0%
yes it's one of those things yeah but
 
01:58:53.109 --> 01:58:53.119 align:start position:0%
but but the interesting thing about
 
01:58:54.750 --> 01:58:54.760 align:start position:0%
horse racing is you can go tie it back
 
01:58:56.669 --> 01:58:56.679 align:start position:0%
to en count yeah right because you got
 
01:58:58.350 --> 01:58:58.360 align:start position:0%
to go place a bet and sometimes you can
 
01:59:00.390 --> 01:59:00.400 align:start position:0%
tie it back if you're doing the the dep
 
01:59:01.910 --> 01:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
Advanced deposit wager and kind of stuff
 
01:59:03.589 --> 01:59:03.599 align:start position:0%
you can tie it back the
 
01:59:05.870 --> 01:59:05.880 align:start position:0%
administrator yeah this is an unknown
 
01:59:08.030 --> 01:59:08.040 align:start position:0%
claimed entity so anyway that money will
 
01:59:09.709 --> 01:59:09.719 align:start position:0%
go to the uh go to the governor's
 
01:59:12.470 --> 01:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund to support um that and
 
01:59:15.750 --> 01:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
the last one we did what's the last one
 
01:59:18.709 --> 01:59:18.719 align:start position:0%
no um we have a weird thing about
 
01:59:21.189 --> 01:59:21.199 align:start position:0%
charity auctions having auctioneers
 
01:59:23.510 --> 01:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
being able to work for charity auctions
 
01:59:25.709 --> 01:59:25.719 align:start position:0%
apparently there was a weird rule that
 
01:59:27.790 --> 01:59:27.800 align:start position:0%
if an Auctioneer came in was auctioning
 
01:59:28.990 --> 01:59:29.000 align:start position:0%
we' they had to go through a criminal
 
01:59:30.589 --> 01:59:30.599 align:start position:0%
background check and a whole bunch of
 
01:59:32.030 --> 01:59:32.040 align:start position:0%
other work just because they were acting
 
01:59:34.390 --> 01:59:34.400 align:start position:0%
as the auctioneer um and we did away
 
01:59:36.270 --> 01:59:36.280 align:start position:0%
with that requirement so that they can
 
01:59:37.870 --> 01:59:37.880 align:start position:0%
go in they can sign a contract with a
 
01:59:39.589 --> 01:59:39.599 align:start position:0%
charity perform an auction because they
 
01:59:41.510 --> 01:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
never touch ownership of the property or
 
01:59:43.390 --> 01:59:43.400 align:start position:0%
the money they can just do provide the
 
01:59:45.669 --> 01:59:45.679 align:start position:0%
service at no and and go through and
 
01:59:46.550 --> 01:59:46.560 align:start position:0%
they don't have to do all that
 
01:59:50.870 --> 01:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
background check um and then lastly
 
01:59:53.430 --> 01:59:53.440 align:start position:0%
um they Advance deposit wagering bill
 
01:59:55.350 --> 01:59:55.360 align:start position:0%
again oh that's an amendment that's it
 
01:59:57.189 --> 01:59:57.199 align:start position:0%
so we havek you thanks for that update
 
01:59:57.199 --> 01:59:58.149 align:start position:0%
so we havek you thanks for that update
appreciate

01:59:58.149 --> 01:59:58.159 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
02:00:02.629 --> 02:00:02.639 align:start position:0%
it John can we get an update on SP sp12
 
02:00:05.430 --> 02:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
rou bill so sp12 is just being held in a
 
02:00:07.109 --> 02:00:07.119 align:start position:0%
bance right now we we're not acting on
 
02:00:11.910 --> 02:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:16.149 --> 02:00:16.159 align:start position:0%
moment okay um next
 
02:00:18.470 --> 02:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
meeting obviously we're going to I'll
 
02:00:21.750 --> 02:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
invite these sh is back yes other
 
02:00:25.310 --> 02:00:25.320 align:start position:0%
business oh I'm sorry yes I'm sorry uh
 
02:00:28.430 --> 02:00:28.440 align:start position:0%
as other business um our office would
 
02:00:31.750 --> 02:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
like the commission to perhaps uh think
 
02:00:35.709 --> 02:00:35.719 align:start position:0%
a little bit about enforcement as the uh
 
02:00:38.430 --> 02:00:38.440 align:start position:0%
industry here in New Hampshire grows uh
 
02:00:40.790 --> 02:00:40.800 align:start position:0%
the way that uh our charitable gaming
 
02:00:43.550 --> 02:00:43.560 align:start position:0%
laws are currently enforced are a
 
02:00:46.350 --> 02:00:46.360 align:start position:0%
combination of State local and Lottery
 
02:00:50.030 --> 02:00:50.040 align:start position:0%
Commission and so one of the things that
 
02:00:53.229 --> 02:00:53.239 align:start position:0%
what that that we see being an issue is
 
02:00:55.550 --> 02:00:55.560 align:start position:0%
as this industry grows as the revenues
 
02:00:57.709 --> 02:00:57.719 align:start position:0%
in this industry become much larger are
 
02:01:00.030 --> 02:01:00.040 align:start position:0%
there adequate resources in place in
 
02:01:05.790 --> 02:01:05.800 align:start position:0%
order to enforce our laws uh we would
 
02:01:09.350 --> 02:01:09.360 align:start position:0%
think that maybe starting with uh some
 
02:01:11.510 --> 02:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
guest speakers from Massachusetts or
 
02:01:13.510 --> 02:01:13.520 align:start position:0%
Maine to come in and talk about some of
 
02:01:16.310 --> 02:01:16.320 align:start position:0%
their enforcement mechanisms uh might be
 
02:01:19.350 --> 02:01:19.360 align:start position:0%
a way to you know kick that off but you
 
02:01:20.750 --> 02:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
know we're just looking at this from the
 
02:01:23.310 --> 02:01:23.320 align:start position:0%
standpoint of you know once this
 
02:01:26.430 --> 02:01:26.440 align:start position:0%
industry kind of gets moving uh which it
 
02:01:28.629 --> 02:01:28.639 align:start position:0%
really has but once it starts getting to
 
02:01:30.870 --> 02:01:30.880 align:start position:0%
the level where uh it's kind of above
 
02:01:32.910 --> 02:01:32.920 align:start position:0%
what local law enforcement can do at
 
02:01:34.750 --> 02:01:34.760 align:start position:0%
that point some state law enforcement is
 
02:01:36.550 --> 02:01:36.560 align:start position:0%
going to probably need to be the folks
 
02:01:39.629 --> 02:01:39.639 align:start position:0%
that uh are dealing with uh with any
 
02:01:42.270 --> 02:01:42.280 align:start position:0%
potential gambling crimes and right now
 
02:01:45.589 --> 02:01:45.599 align:start position:0%
our office isn't really set up for that
 
02:01:48.030 --> 02:01:48.040 align:start position:0%
um nor do I think is the Lottery
 
02:01:49.310 --> 02:01:49.320 align:start position:0%
Commission so they don't have have any
 
02:01:51.310 --> 02:01:51.320 align:start position:0%
criminal investigators in their
 
02:01:53.390 --> 02:01:53.400 align:start position:0%
organization so we would be relying on
 
02:01:55.870 --> 02:01:55.880 align:start position:0%
local police to do those kinds of things
 
02:01:57.510 --> 02:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
that might not be realistic on a go
 
02:01:59.310 --> 02:01:59.320 align:start position:0%
forward basis so that's some of the
 
02:02:01.030 --> 02:02:01.040 align:start position:0%
things that you know conversations we've
 
02:02:03.629 --> 02:02:03.639 align:start position:0%
had internally also on the civil law
 
02:02:08.270 --> 02:02:08.280 align:start position:0%
side going through the actions of uh you
 
02:02:10.069 --> 02:02:10.079 align:start position:0%
know either suspending or revoking a
 
02:02:12.750 --> 02:02:12.760 align:start position:0%
license how that is handled uh who from
 
02:02:15.430 --> 02:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
the AG's office may be needed to uh you
 
02:02:17.189 --> 02:02:17.199 align:start position:0%
know go ahead and prosecute those kinds
 
02:02:19.189 --> 02:02:19.199 align:start position:0%
of things we're right now looking at at
 
02:02:21.350 --> 02:02:21.360 align:start position:0%
it as a civil function versus a criminal
 
02:02:24.950 --> 02:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
one I could agree more that that we to
 
02:02:26.589 --> 02:02:26.599 align:start position:0%
me in the back of my mind I know we were
 
02:02:28.669 --> 02:02:28.679 align:start position:0%
going to be looking at is there enough
 
02:02:31.109 --> 02:02:31.119 align:start position:0%
resource to to properly oversee this
 
02:02:35.830 --> 02:02:35.840 align:start position:0%
from a criminal uh standpoint so that's
 
02:02:37.310 --> 02:02:37.320 align:start position:0%
something that we'll do and that's
 
02:02:39.390 --> 02:02:39.400 align:start position:0%
probably a good idea to try to bring in
 
02:02:41.109 --> 02:02:41.119 align:start position:0%
these other states again to see if they
 
02:02:43.270 --> 02:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
can help us out with what they're doing
 
02:02:44.669 --> 02:02:44.679 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming that the consultant was
 
02:02:46.149 --> 02:02:46.159 align:start position:0%
supposed to to me the consultant was
 
02:02:47.750 --> 02:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
supposed to also kind of touch on these
 
02:02:50.470 --> 02:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
things too how we structure do we have
 
02:02:54.109 --> 02:02:54.119 align:start position:0%
the right resource here and clearly I
 
02:02:55.870 --> 02:02:55.880 align:start position:0%
mean Charlie you're saving the day with
 
02:02:57.069 --> 02:02:57.079 align:start position:0%
your all your
 
02:03:01.390 --> 02:03:01.400 align:start position:0%
revenues in the State uh I mean I do
 
02:03:03.629 --> 02:03:03.639 align:start position:0%
look at the revenue focus and it's it's
 
02:03:06.030 --> 02:03:06.040 align:start position:0%
amazing um and some of it has to do with
 
02:03:07.589 --> 02:03:07.599 align:start position:0%
travel gaming but most of it has to do
 
02:03:12.109 --> 02:03:12.119 align:start position:0%
with sports betting probably but uh so
 
02:03:12.119 --> 02:03:13.030 align:start position:0%
with sports betting probably but uh so
with

02:03:13.030 --> 02:03:13.040 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:03:15.870 --> 02:03:15.880 align:start position:0%
that uh let's let's talk about the next
 
02:03:18.350 --> 02:03:18.360 align:start position:0%
meeting certainly we'll have the these
 
02:03:19.550 --> 02:03:19.560 align:start position:0%
three speak speakers that we're going to
 
02:03:22.870 --> 02:03:22.880 align:start position:0%
be here today back uh we'll see where we
 
02:03:24.270 --> 02:03:24.280 align:start position:0%
are with the
 
02:03:26.310 --> 02:03:26.320 align:start position:0%
RFP I don't know if the time will be
 
02:03:28.709 --> 02:03:28.719 align:start position:0%
right I'm bar looking at that end of
 
02:03:31.589 --> 02:03:31.599 align:start position:0%
February like three weeks out
 
02:03:31.599 --> 02:03:33.189 align:start position:0%
February like three weeks out
still

02:03:33.189 --> 02:03:33.199 align:start position:0%
still
 
02:03:36.550 --> 02:03:36.560 align:start position:0%

02:04:46.910 --> 02:04:46.920 align:start position:0%
um well well
 
02:04:54.790 --> 02:04:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:57.350 --> 02:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
um what about the Tuesday let's just
 
02:05:00.030 --> 02:05:00.040 align:start position:0%
talk about Tuesday the 20th I I have
 
02:05:03.430 --> 02:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
sent an education that morning um okay
 
02:05:04.870 --> 02:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
Tuesdays and Wednesdays in the morning
 
02:05:10.270 --> 02:05:10.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:12.750 --> 02:05:12.760 align:start position:0%
up okay we're going to skip a whole
 
02:05:15.149 --> 02:05:15.159 align:start position:0%
another week with the the vacation week
 
02:05:16.910 --> 02:05:16.920 align:start position:0%
for the
 
02:05:19.189 --> 02:05:19.199 align:start position:0%
legislators um which have been to the
 
02:05:19.199 --> 02:05:20.830 align:start position:0%
legislators um which have been to the
4th

02:05:20.830 --> 02:05:20.840 align:start position:0%
4th
 
02:05:23.310 --> 02:05:23.320 align:start position:0%
Monday I guess the only benefit there is
 
02:05:25.549 --> 02:05:25.559 align:start position:0%
that we would have had our chance to
 
02:05:28.030 --> 02:05:28.040 align:start position:0%
select our our
 
02:05:32.030 --> 02:05:32.040 align:start position:0%
vendor do you think by the 4th
 
02:05:34.270 --> 02:05:34.280 align:start position:0%
March and then we might want to invite
 
02:05:38.390 --> 02:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
them here it's not you work it's not
 
02:05:40.910 --> 02:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
that all
 
02:05:43.390 --> 02:05:43.400 align:start position:0%
right but if we did something like even
 
02:05:47.669 --> 02:05:47.679 align:start position:0%
on the how about Friday the
 
02:05:50.750 --> 02:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
23rd can we meet I hate to change the
 
02:05:50.760 --> 02:05:52.470 align:start position:0%

day
 
02:05:55.069 --> 02:05:55.079 align:start position:0%

02:06:01.510 --> 02:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:03.790 --> 02:06:03.800 align:start position:0%
23rd does that work for
 
02:06:06.709 --> 02:06:06.719 align:start position:0%
