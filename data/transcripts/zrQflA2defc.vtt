00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 align:start position:0%
Skype
 
00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 align:start position:0%
um at this point we're looking at the HB
 
00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
55 FN which we are relative to driver's
 
00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:41.890 align:start position:0%
55 FN which we are relative to driver's
education

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:44.940 align:start position:0%
and what I'm looking for right now today
 
00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
is just to it's a workshop so I'm just
 
00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:48.620 align:start position:0%
trying to gather information
 
00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
I can tell you that this last session uh
 
00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.409 align:start position:0%
I can tell you that this last session uh
I

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:54.419 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 align:start position:0%
it was introduced and uh it I felt it
 
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.600 align:start position:0%
wasn't quite baked and I would like to
 
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.280 align:start position:0%
see an amendment to it myself personally
 
00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:05.639 align:start position:0%
but also I'm hearing um
 
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
that there could been uh opportunities
 
00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:10.919 align:start position:0%
through Department of Safety that maybe
 
00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:13.979 align:start position:0%
some changes have been made to allow the
 
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:17.460 align:start position:0%
driver's education for 16 year olds to
 
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.060 align:start position:0%
have easier access to it all right so if
 
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:22.380 align:start position:0%
there's anyone out there that would like
 
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
to speak to this uh I'd be grateful to
 
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 align:start position:0%
just yeah just come on up to the
 
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:32.580 align:start position:0%
microphone and introduce you any uh so
 
00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:35.100 align:start position:0%

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:37.080 align:start position:0%
and I don't see any orange badge so I
 
00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:39.180 align:start position:0%
don't I say you're not a lobbyist
 
00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:40.919 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Jennifer Bailey
 
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:43.800 align:start position:0%
and I am the administrator for the DMV
 
00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:45.479 align:start position:0%
um and I'm going to have this gentleman
 
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:49.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
good morning super Rick DuPont from the
 
00:06:53.689 --> 00:06:53.699 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire State Police my supervised
 
00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:55.620 align:start position:0%
driver's education
 
00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:57.660 align:start position:0%
so I'm here on behalf of director
 
00:06:59.870 --> 00:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
marasco he is out at a conference today
 
00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:01.919 align:start position:0%
and he wanted me to discuss some of the
 
00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
changes that we have been working on in
 
00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:06.060 align:start position:0%
the division
 
00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:08.100 align:start position:0%
um so first off there is pending
 
00:07:10.309 --> 00:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
emergency rule changes being drafted by
 
00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:13.199 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety legal to amend the
 
00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:15.600 align:start position:0%
current 300 hours of direct supervision
 
00:07:18.129 --> 00:07:18.139 align:start position:0%
of new driver's ed instructors
 
00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:21.060 align:start position:0%
by a standard certificate holder to 30
 
00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:23.940 align:start position:0%
hours of direct classroom supervision 15
 
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
hours of direct Supervision in a vehicle
 
00:07:29.629 --> 00:07:29.639 align:start position:0%
10 of which covers the 10 one-hour
 
00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:31.919 align:start position:0%
topics and the remaining five to be
 
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:33.720 align:start position:0%
applied as needed
 
00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:35.580 align:start position:0%
I don't know so could you just repeat
 
00:07:37.189 --> 00:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
that again just a little bit slow I want
 
00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:38.460 align:start position:0%
to make sure I'm catching this because
 
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
it sounds like some big changes sure
 
00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
so right now we're going to admit we're
 
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
trying to amend the current 300 hours of
 
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
direct supervision for new driver's ed
 
00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:50.870 align:start position:0%
direct supervision for new driver's ed
instructors

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
instructors
 
00:07:53.809 --> 00:07:53.819 align:start position:0%
so they would now only have to do 30
 
00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:56.220 align:start position:0%
hours of direct classroom supervision
 
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
which is one full class program
 
00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:02.940 align:start position:0%
15 hours of direct Supervision in the
 
00:08:05.689 --> 00:08:05.699 align:start position:0%
vehicle 10 of which covers the 10 one
 
00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
hour topics and the remaining five to be
 
00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:09.660 align:start position:0%
applied as needed
 
00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:18.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:21.469 --> 00:08:21.479 align:start position:0%
then there's also a current rule
 
00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
proposal to allow primary care
 
00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:25.020 align:start position:0%
physicians to assess hearing
 
00:08:27.589 --> 00:08:27.599 align:start position:0%
capabilities as opposed to the current
 
00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:30.180 align:start position:0%
need to complete an audiometric exam
 
00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:32.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:35.149 --> 00:08:35.159 align:start position:0%
so the hope is that these are designed
 
00:08:36.589 --> 00:08:36.599 align:start position:0%
to increase driver ed instructor
 
00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:40.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
all right thank you so the way I'm
 
00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
seeing this and if anybody has any
 
00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
questions uh just interrupt me all right
 
00:08:49.269 --> 00:08:49.279 align:start position:0%
the uh so you're going from 300 hours
 
00:08:53.509 --> 00:08:53.519 align:start position:0%
down to 65 hours is that what I'm
 
00:08:53.519 --> 00:08:56.810 align:start position:0%
down to 65 hours is that what I'm
understanding

00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:56.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:59.630 --> 00:08:59.640 align:start position:0%
yes that's correct
 
00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:05.940 align:start position:0%
what's the uh the 20 hours of like you
 
00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
so it has 20 hours of additional
 
00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:17.700 align:start position:0%
mentoring so what's what does that mean
 
00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:20.220 align:start position:0%
um I apologize I'm not familiar with the
 
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
process this is just some notes the
 
00:09:23.509 --> 00:09:23.519 align:start position:0%
director has given me to read off to you
 
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
are you familiar so originally it was
 
00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:29.220 align:start position:0%
300 hours of um
 
00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
directly supervised instruction after a
 
00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:34.380 align:start position:0%
student after a instructor candidate
 
00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
comes out of their college education
 
00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:40.680 align:start position:0%
and then there's the 300 follow-up at
 
00:09:42.829 --> 00:09:42.839 align:start position:0%
the driving school and right now the
 
00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:45.540 align:start position:0%
mentoring is going to be
 
00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:48.060 align:start position:0%
um it's it's still training but it's
 
00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:50.100 align:start position:0%
just more of an oversight
 
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
um by the school owner itself to provide
 
00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
additional training
 
00:09:58.490 --> 00:09:58.500 align:start position:0%
to that instructor
 
00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:00.889 align:start position:0%
to that instructor
this

00:10:00.889 --> 00:10:00.899 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:03.540 align:start position:0%
is for the in order to increase the
 
00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:07.100 align:start position:0%
number of instructors that where or or
 
00:10:09.949 --> 00:10:09.959 align:start position:0%
driver education programs throughout the
 
00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:14.220 align:start position:0%
state this is an attempt to make it more
 
00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:16.680 align:start position:0%
accessible for the students this doesn't
 
00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:18.420 align:start position:0%
this isn't what the students are going
 
00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
to be reading no I do have more um on
 
00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:22.500 align:start position:0%
the student side of things this is just
 
00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
the starting point for the instructors
 
00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:25.860 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:10:29.269 --> 00:10:29.279 align:start position:0%
so another question I have is the uh
 
00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
besides the 300 hours which was there
 
00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:34.260 align:start position:0%
originally would say we're down to 65
 
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
now at this point
 
00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:38.220 align:start position:0%
was there other training for the
 
00:10:41.509 --> 00:10:41.519 align:start position:0%
instructors as well I mean college
 
00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:43.620 align:start position:0%
degree associates degree anything like
 
00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:47.220 align:start position:0%
that they I'm just what else was what
 
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
else was required for an instructor to
 
00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:50.820 align:start position:0%
become an instructor that's what I'm
 
00:10:51.949 --> 00:10:51.959 align:start position:0%
getting it
 
00:10:54.829 --> 00:10:54.839 align:start position:0%
that's a good question sir uh and and
 
00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:57.180 align:start position:0%
Mike Doucette Mr Mike Doucette is in the
 
00:10:59.630 --> 00:10:59.640 align:start position:0%
audience today and he actually runs the
 
00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:01.140 align:start position:0%
program for White Mountains Community
 
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
College and he can definitely speak very
 
00:11:05.569 --> 00:11:05.579 align:start position:0%
intelligently to that but there is a
 
00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
program that all of our instructors are
 
00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:10.140 align:start position:0%
required to participate in in order to
 
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
become to receive their certification
 
00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:15.300 align:start position:0%
their initial certification and it is
 
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
completing three
 
00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
um college level courses
 
00:11:22.009 --> 00:11:22.019 align:start position:0%
and then the follow-up after that is
 
00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:24.060 align:start position:0%
that they apply make application to the
 
00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:27.720 align:start position:0%
DMV and then they have to pass a written
 
00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:31.260 align:start position:0%
test and then a road test
 
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
and then once they pass all that then
 
00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:34.680 align:start position:0%
they receive their provisional
 
00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:36.230 align:start position:0%
they receive their provisional
certification

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
certification
 
00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:37.860 align:start position:0%
it's it's similar to like a youth
 
00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:40.740 align:start position:0%
operator's license and then they go to
 
00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:42.300 align:start position:0%
their school and then they have
 
00:11:44.569 --> 00:11:44.579 align:start position:0%
additional training that um Miss Bailey
 
00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:46.620 align:start position:0%
was talking about
 
00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
and on that note in addition
 
00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:51.420 align:start position:0%
um we are working with the White
 
00:11:53.569 --> 00:11:53.579 align:start position:0%
Mountain community and they're we're
 
00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:55.860 align:start position:0%
releasing a flyer advertising of 50
 
00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
reduction in driver ed costs for new
 
00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:05.220 align:start position:0%
all right thank you the the uh the three
 
00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:07.260 align:start position:0%
courses that you're talking about uh
 
00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:09.540 align:start position:0%
approximately how long do they what's
 
00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
the duration
 
00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
to complete those classes I think Mr
 
00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:17.160 align:start position:0%
Ducette could
 
00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
normally it's one semester for the first
 
00:12:21.069 --> 00:12:21.079 align:start position:0%
three course
 
00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:24.060 align:start position:0%
three courses take one three five week
 
00:12:26.269 --> 00:12:26.279 align:start position:0%
courses and they can be done in one
 
00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:30.060 align:start position:0%
semester now and be eligible to test for
 
00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:32.700 align:start position:0%
a provisional instructor if they want to
 
00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:34.620 align:start position:0%
go higher than that the standard
 
00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:37.200 align:start position:0%
certificate there are five additional
 
00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:39.180 align:start position:0%
courses they take within the next two
 
00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:40.009 align:start position:0%
courses they take within the next two
years

00:12:40.009 --> 00:12:40.019 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:42.540 align:start position:0%
all right thank you uh go ahead you said
 
00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
you had more on the draw on yeah any
 
00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:49.800 align:start position:0%
yeah go ahead
 
00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
um so I already mentioned the flyer
 
00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:54.240 align:start position:0%
advertising the 50 reduction
 
00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:56.220 align:start position:0%
um also Troop G has
 
00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
um change the process of completing the
 
00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
background checks for new instructors
 
00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:02.820 align:start position:0%
and there has already been a decrease
 
00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:04.740 align:start position:0%
scene with the amount of time they're
 
00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:06.180 align:start position:0%
waiting for their background checks to
 
00:13:08.569 --> 00:13:08.579 align:start position:0%
be completed
 
00:13:11.329 --> 00:13:11.339 align:start position:0%
and then the last topic he wanted me to
 
00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
mention is for the students we have been
 
00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
working on and a soon to release a flyer
 
00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire driving schools to
 
00:13:20.629 --> 00:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
market the New Hampshire driver ed
 
00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:22.980 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund for those who can't
 
00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
afford the full cost of driver education
 
00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:27.660 align:start position:0%
we've worked with the community to come
 
00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:40.380 align:start position:0%
on the scholarship fund do you have any
 
00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:44.100 align:start position:0%
particulars on the application process
 
00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:46.260 align:start position:0%
for that for the students
 
00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:49.260 align:start position:0%
I personally do not I believe someone in
 
00:13:55.569 --> 00:13:55.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:09.540 align:start position:0%
do you want me to step away and we can
 
00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
switch out for
 
00:14:12.949 --> 00:14:12.959 align:start position:0%
uh are you all set all right that's all

for them
 
00:14:30.889 --> 00:14:30.899 align:start position:0%

models Community College
 
00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:16.740 align:start position:0%
we have all of the instructors coming to
 
00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:19.620 align:start position:0%
us from New Hampshire and Vermont out of
 
00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
our College in little Littleton campus
 
00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:25.380 align:start position:0%
I welcome any questions that you may
 
00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:27.420 align:start position:0%
have I don't have any prepared remarks I
 
00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:28.860 align:start position:0%
just we're here to try to answer
 
00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:31.860 align:start position:0%
questions that you may have to have a
 
00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:34.380 align:start position:0%
better idea I can talk to what some of
 
00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:36.300 align:start position:0%
the conversation you just had to answer
 
00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:39.540 align:start position:0%
some of those questions if that's okay
 
00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
um the question about the scholarship
 
00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:44.220 align:start position:0%
program the director uh when he first
 
00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
took over director of motor vehicles uh
 
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
he is he established a driver education
 
00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:52.680 align:start position:0%
task force trying to make things better
 
00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
uh that was one of his first in and he's
 
00:15:57.949 --> 00:15:57.959 align:start position:0%
been working on it tirelessly trying to
 
00:16:00.949 --> 00:16:00.959 align:start position:0%
help us bring driver education to the
 
00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
teens and make it more uh easily
 
00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
accessible uh trying to reduce the wait
 
00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
times and finally trying to find ways to
 
00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:11.180 align:start position:0%
make things work to that end
 
00:16:14.389 --> 00:16:14.399 align:start position:0%
we've changed our program to make our
 
00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
courses the five-week format at the
 
00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
college so that if a
 
00:16:23.449 --> 00:16:23.459 align:start position:0%
instructor student only needs one course
 
00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
they you know they aren't waiting months
 
00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
to get in because we we run those first
 
00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:30.660 align:start position:0%
three courses year round now used to be
 
00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
you know we as a driving in school owner
 
00:16:35.509 --> 00:16:35.519 align:start position:0%
I would come and find someone in April
 
00:16:36.829 --> 00:16:36.839 align:start position:0%
Say Hey I want you to be an instructor
 
00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:38.940 align:start position:0%
they're all excited and then you'd have
 
00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
to wait till the fall to get into a
 
00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:41.629 align:start position:0%
to wait till the fall to get into a
course

00:16:41.629 --> 00:16:41.639 align:start position:0%
course
 
00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:43.860 align:start position:0%
and then when you get to you know August
 
00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
when the courses start yeah I found
 
00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:46.680 align:start position:0%
something else to do I'm not going to do
 
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
it so now I'm stuck without another
 
00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
instructor but now the way we have the
 
00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:53.100 align:start position:0%
program set up at the college I could
 
00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:54.540 align:start position:0%
hire someone tomorrow and the next class
 
00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
will be a month away roughly that they
 
00:16:58.550 --> 00:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
can jump into and get into there's no
 
00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
prerequisites you don't have to take him
 
00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
in any order uh we we're trying to help
 
00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:05.400 align:start position:0%
the driving schools and we've had raving
 
00:17:07.669 --> 00:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
reviews from the driving schools that
 
00:17:09.049 --> 00:17:09.059 align:start position:0%
we're able to get more instructors
 
00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
through I've got 19 students in my
 
00:17:13.669 --> 00:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
current class I think I think five of
 
00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:15.720 align:start position:0%
them from are from Vermont but we are
 
00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
pushing to get as many instructors
 
00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:19.980 align:start position:0%
through to the state to get them
 
00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
licensed so that we can reduce that
 
00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:25.140 align:start position:0%
backlog and the many other things that
 
00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:27.839 align:start position:0%
we're working on we're working on a
 
00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:29.640 align:start position:0%
total revamp of the driver education
 
00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:32.460 align:start position:0%
rules and one of the to me one of the
 
00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:34.860 align:start position:0%
biggest targets of that when it gets to
 
00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
it's got to go through all the regular
 
00:17:39.409 --> 00:17:39.419 align:start position:0%
channels of the administrative rules
 
00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
committee and such but once that's in
 
00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
place uh this if it goes as we expect if
 
00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
the rules are accepted we're going to
 
00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:52.200 align:start position:0%
try to roll back the a small window that
 
00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:54.360 align:start position:0%
teens have to get into driver education
 
00:17:57.650 --> 00:17:57.660 align:start position:0%
from 15 and nine months back to 15 and a
 
00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
half and then also make it so parents
 
00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:01.980 align:start position:0%
could drive with their team beginning at
 
00:18:04.669 --> 00:18:04.679 align:start position:0%
15 and three months instead of 15 and a
 
00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
half so that we now have as a driving
 
00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:09.780 align:start position:0%
school we now have six months to get all
 
00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:13.500 align:start position:0%
cram all of those newly uh wanting to be
 
00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
licensed drivers into driver ed and I
 
00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:17.340 align:start position:0%
think that's going to be a huge
 
00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
difference in in any wait times and such
 
00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:21.660 align:start position:0%
because they aren't you know if you
 
00:18:22.789 --> 00:18:22.799 align:start position:0%
don't can't get into this class you've
 
00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
got six months to get into another one
 
00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
before your 16th birthday and I think
 
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
that's going to be a huge change and try
 
00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:35.100 align:start position:0%
thank you and the driver's side right
 
00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:36.780 align:start position:0%
now once you get your license what is it
 
00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:39.480 align:start position:0%
16 and a half 16 you can get you after
 
00:18:40.789 --> 00:18:40.799 align:start position:0%
you've taken driver's ed you can get
 
00:18:42.409 --> 00:18:42.419 align:start position:0%
your license on your 16th birthday on
 
00:18:46.549 --> 00:18:46.559 align:start position:0%
your 16th okay yes sir any questions
 
00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh so I got two
 
00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
questions the first one what what's the
 
00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:53.220 align:start position:0%
average hourly wage for a driver's
 
00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:54.289 align:start position:0%
average hourly wage for a driver's
instructor

00:18:54.289 --> 00:18:54.299 align:start position:0%
instructor
 
00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
um for a new instructor while they're in
 
00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
training I've seen uh low 20s once
 
00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
they're trained and able to teach all 10
 
00:19:04.789 --> 00:19:04.799 align:start position:0%
lessons and uh then their ups were in
 
00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:08.340 align:start position:0%
the 25 range and I'd say 30 range for
 
00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:10.440 align:start position:0%
people who can teach all the driving
 
00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:12.900 align:start position:0%
in-car lessons and all of the classroom
 
00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:15.900 align:start position:0%
lessons once they're trained enough to
 
00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
do all of that that's a normal and some
 
00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
go a little higher as well and do they
 
00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:22.620 align:start position:0%
do they typically work a full 40-hour
 
00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
week I mean are they like what's what's
 
00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
the average like hourly so all the folks
 
00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:29.580 align:start position:0%
who work for me are part-time but there
 
00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
are schools that have enough volume to
 
00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:35.640 align:start position:0%
have many full-time employees so
 
00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:38.940 align:start position:0%
um for my myself in my situation I have
 
00:19:42.289 --> 00:19:42.299 align:start position:0%
two locations Littleton and Lincoln and
 
00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
um I'd say I only have one that works
 
00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:46.500 align:start position:0%
near a 40-hour week the others probably
 
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
work 20s okay and um so the as far as
 
00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:52.860 align:start position:0%
the curriculum I mean the spirit from
 
00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
what I remember from when the um you
 
00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
know the people who testified on this
 
00:19:58.789 --> 00:19:58.799 align:start position:0%
and the sponsors of this bill the spirit
 
00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
of this bill is kind of for parents to
 
00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
be able to get more involved in like you
 
00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:04.020 align:start position:0%
know the driver's education of their
 
00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:05.820 align:start position:0%
their children is kind of the way that I
 
00:20:07.669 --> 00:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
understood the spirit of the bill have
 
00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:09.240 align:start position:0%
you looked into any kind of curriculums
 
00:20:10.909 --> 00:20:10.919 align:start position:0%
or anything that maybe some kind of a
 
00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
hybrid system where like in engaged
 
00:20:15.529 --> 00:20:15.539 align:start position:0%
parents might be able to do that I mean
 
00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
well any to me any driving school that
 
00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:20.340 align:start position:0%
worth anything is getting the parents
 
00:20:22.549 --> 00:20:22.559 align:start position:0%
involved yeah I mandate my parents
 
00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:25.740 align:start position:0%
involvement uh because it's a it's a
 
00:20:27.289 --> 00:20:27.299 align:start position:0%
Cooperative effort I've only got their
 
00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:29.640 align:start position:0%
teens in the car for 10 hours you know
 
00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
so that's you know if they want me to
 
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
say you know here's my new new team
 
00:20:34.669 --> 00:20:34.679 align:start position:0%
never driven before teach them how to
 
00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
drive yeah you know that team is not
 
00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
going to get anywhere near as good as
 
00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:40.200 align:start position:0%
someone who's been driving out with
 
00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
their parents since 15 and a half and
 
00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:44.100 align:start position:0%
gotten to drive quite a bit because I'm
 
00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:47.100 align:start position:0%
then I'm teaching more you know
 
00:20:48.529 --> 00:20:48.539 align:start position:0%
knowledge-based skills rather than
 
00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:50.340 align:start position:0%
there's the gas pedal there's the brake
 
00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:52.500 align:start position:0%
pedal uh yeah and here we go from here
 
00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:55.140 align:start position:0%
you know we can get so much more and
 
00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
that's not my understanding of the bill
 
00:20:59.450 --> 00:20:59.460 align:start position:0%
my understanding of the bill was that it
 
00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:02.100 align:start position:0%
was to uh because someone couldn't get
 
00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:05.220 align:start position:0%
their their team into a program uh they
 
00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
wanted to have an availability to have
 
00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:10.860 align:start position:0%
parent taught driver education and we're
 
00:21:13.909 --> 00:21:13.919 align:start position:0%
trying to fix that problem and with the
 
00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:15.720 align:start position:0%
drive red task force and we're trying to
 
00:21:18.049 --> 00:21:18.059 align:start position:0%
make that reduce those wait times
 
00:21:18.059 --> 00:21:19.270 align:start position:0%
make that reduce those wait times
because

00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:22.980 align:start position:0%
the folks that that at DMV have been
 
00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:25.020 align:start position:0%
watching the numbers of people who come
 
00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:26.700 align:start position:0%
through have never had Drive red the 18
 
00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
year olds and they there's a marked
 
00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:31.500 align:start position:0%
difference between those those young
 
00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:33.780 align:start position:0%
adults in the in the teens who have
 
00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
taken driver education okay thank you
 
00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:40.140 align:start position:0%
any others
 
00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:43.320 align:start position:0%
so a question I have is um
 
00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
you said you're out of white mountain
 
00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:47.220 align:start position:0%
right yes sir anybody else throughout
 
00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:49.740 align:start position:0%
the state we there was a program at
 
00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:50.810 align:start position:0%
the state we there was a program at
Keene

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:50.820 align:start position:0%
Keene
 
00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:52.500 align:start position:0%
um Keene State had a program for a
 
00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:55.020 align:start position:0%
number of years and for whatever reason
 
00:21:57.770 --> 00:21:57.780 align:start position:0%
and I'm I I've got to believe that uh
 
00:22:00.169 --> 00:22:00.179 align:start position:0%
our our costs were one of the reasons
 
00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:01.980 align:start position:0%
that they decided there was a lot of
 
00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
people coming to our program because it
 
00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
was twice as much to go as a new
 
00:22:08.149 --> 00:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
instructor to go to their program and
 
00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
they have no difference in their tuition
 
00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:12.360 align:start position:0%
from their online programs versus their
 
00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
in-person programs and uh ours were much
 
00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:19.140 align:start position:0%
much more uh reasonably priced is all I
 
00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:20.940 align:start position:0%
can I don't know why particularly but
 
00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:22.559 align:start position:0%
I'm guessing that's what's happened so
 
00:22:24.289 --> 00:22:24.299 align:start position:0%
you don't have to physically be at your
 
00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:26.220 align:start position:0%
program you continue we have one day
 
00:22:28.669 --> 00:22:28.679 align:start position:0%
that they have to come in person uh
 
00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:31.740 align:start position:0%
where we do in-vehicle uh training with
 
00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:33.480 align:start position:0%
with the students
 
00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
and is uh going back to the driver's ed
 
00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
part for the 16 year old
 
00:22:40.789 --> 00:22:40.799 align:start position:0%
as far as having the parents involved
 
00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:44.460 align:start position:0%
yes sir uh doesn't the current RSA say
 
00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
they have to be 40 hours 40. current
 
00:22:49.250 --> 00:22:49.260 align:start position:0%
rules say that they have to have 40
 
00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
hours of documented time but coming to a
 
00:22:54.049 --> 00:22:54.059 align:start position:0%
driver education program if they haven't
 
00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
been driving at all they're far they're
 
00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
way behind the curve
 
00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
um which is why from day one of people
 
00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:02.820 align:start position:0%
contacting my school I'm saying get out
 
00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:04.200 align:start position:0%
there and drive with your team parking
 
00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
lots back roads just get some comfort
 
00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:07.260 align:start position:0%
level behind the wheel we'll teach them
 
00:23:09.049 --> 00:23:09.059 align:start position:0%
all the stuff they need to know just get
 
00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
them so that they know where the gas
 
00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
pedal is and you know how much to turn
 
00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:14.220 align:start position:0%
the wheel and what reaction is going to
 
00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
make as they go just try to get smooth a
 
00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:17.220 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:19.320 align:start position:0%
so I can testify to that I'm teaching a
 
00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:21.720 align:start position:0%
15 year old Now parking lot back roads
 
00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:23.940 align:start position:0%
yeah I think we have a lot of back roads
 
00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
and not many so
 
00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:28.260 align:start position:0%
um any case yes
 
00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:28.909 align:start position:0%
um any case yes
um

00:23:28.909 --> 00:23:28.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:32.280 align:start position:0%
any other questions anybody else
 
00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:34.740 align:start position:0%
so over I'm just thinking overall I mean
 
00:23:36.409 --> 00:23:36.419 align:start position:0%
we're trying to
 
00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:39.900 align:start position:0%
release reduce the bottleneck which is
 
00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
you know I know we signed our
 
00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:45.900 align:start position:0%
child up six months in advance just to
 
00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:47.640 align:start position:0%
get into a school so
 
00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:49.260 align:start position:0%
and we're trying the same we're trying
 
00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
as well that was one of the directors
 
00:23:52.909 --> 00:23:52.919 align:start position:0%
you know biggest things when we came to
 
00:23:54.649 --> 00:23:54.659 align:start position:0%
the driveway task force a year and a
 
00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
half ago is we need to change things and
 
00:23:58.970 --> 00:23:58.980 align:start position:0%
we've done Lieutenant Leary and all of
 
00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:01.260 align:start position:0%
the uh folks all the stakeholders have
 
00:24:03.529 --> 00:24:03.539 align:start position:0%
gone through all of the current rules to
 
00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:06.900 align:start position:0%
try to modify them to help solve that
 
00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:08.580 align:start position:0%
problem and we think we've got a good
 
00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:09.960 align:start position:0%
handle on it and it's going to make a
 
00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:11.580 align:start position:0%
huge difference once we get those new
 
00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:14.100 align:start position:0%
rules through okay so another question I
 
00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:16.140 align:start position:0%
have is as far as
 
00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:19.500 align:start position:0%
parents teaching their child
 
00:24:22.669 --> 00:24:22.679 align:start position:0%
Driver's Ed versus going to a school yes
 
00:24:25.669 --> 00:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
you still don't recommend that I I do
 
00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
not remember as I say a lot I bet 40
 
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
Years of law enforcement experience and
 
00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:35.100 align:start position:0%
and 34 or so of of teaching driving I've
 
00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
seen some of the people that drive out
 
00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
there and I would not want them teaching
 
00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:41.100 align:start position:0%
young people to drive the way they drive
 
00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:44.340 align:start position:0%
so I'm just one happens what happens to
 
00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:46.200 align:start position:0%
those that don't ever take drivers that
 
00:24:48.049 --> 00:24:48.059 align:start position:0%
I mean we we end up with them at 18
 
00:24:50.029 --> 00:24:50.039 align:start position:0%
going for license they're way behind the
 
00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:51.900 align:start position:0%
curve I think uh in the last hearing we
 
00:24:54.289 --> 00:24:54.299 align:start position:0%
had some of the examiners come in and
 
00:24:58.010 --> 00:24:58.020 align:start position:0%
express of what they've seen of the uh
 
00:24:59.210 --> 00:24:59.220 align:start position:0%
people who come in with no driver
 
00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:02.340 align:start position:0%
education background uh that they can
 
00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:04.200 align:start position:0%
they are they don't do as well there's a
 
00:25:06.289 --> 00:25:06.299 align:start position:0%
higher failure rate and they they don't
 
00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
know the rules
 
00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
they get no they haven't learned them
 
00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:11.940 align:start position:0%
enough to read the driver manual enough
 
00:25:14.169 --> 00:25:14.179 align:start position:0%
to get past their driver education test
 
00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:17.580 align:start position:0%
but uh they aren't as as skilled as the
 
00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:19.260 align:start position:0%
uh the teens who come through a driver
 
00:25:21.049 --> 00:25:21.059 align:start position:0%
education program
 
00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
again I'm just wondering if there's you
 
00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:25.010 align:start position:0%
again I'm just wondering if there's you
know

00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:25.020 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:28.380 align:start position:0%
the the uh bill that was put in one to
 
00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:31.980 align:start position:0%
have 40 hours behind the wheel and
 
00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:32.750 align:start position:0%
have 40 hours behind the wheel and
um

00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:32.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:34.740 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering if they if even if we
 
00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
raise that to 120 hours for the parents
 
00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
and them to give you a specific route
 
00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
you know clock in clock out time stuff
 
00:25:44.269 --> 00:25:44.279 align:start position:0%
like that you don't think that would I'm
 
00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:46.140 align:start position:0%
just thinking people that like alternate
 
00:25:48.529 --> 00:25:48.539 align:start position:0%
School homeschool stuff like that why
 
00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
can't they do this as well I think I
 
00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:52.980 align:start position:0%
think it's a great idea the only I I
 
00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:55.620 align:start position:0%
still disagree with doing that but I
 
00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
still worry about the parents that that
 
00:25:59.570 --> 00:25:59.580 align:start position:0%
are working three jobs yeah I'm going to
 
00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:01.980 align:start position:0%
write down that we drove today uh three
 
00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:04.620 align:start position:0%
hours and uh you know just keep fudging
 
00:26:06.169 --> 00:26:06.179 align:start position:0%
the numbers and we're going to have many
 
00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:09.500 align:start position:0%
teens out there who have zero experience
 
00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:11.940 align:start position:0%
and just get through their tests and
 
00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:13.010 align:start position:0%
and just get through their tests and
then

00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:13.020 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:14.700 align:start position:0%
we hope that they don't crash or get
 
00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
something you know one of the big things
 
00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:19.380 align:start position:0%
I push with my parents is is we have a
 
00:26:21.289 --> 00:26:21.299 align:start position:0%
parent night that you know as I say I
 
00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:22.740 align:start position:0%
want that parent involvement we have
 
00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
mandatory parent night and one of the
 
00:26:25.909 --> 00:26:25.919 align:start position:0%
things I push them what other course can
 
00:26:27.529 --> 00:26:27.539 align:start position:0%
your team take that if they don't get it
 
00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:29.400 align:start position:0%
right that they can die
 
00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:31.500 align:start position:0%
you know their mask scores they may not
 
00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:34.140 align:start position:0%
be able to get the high-end computer
 
00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
tech job but by not doing this right
 
00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:40.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:43.980 align:start position:0%
so what about the at the older adults at
 
00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:45.900 align:start position:0%
this point the 18 year old and older
 
00:26:48.049 --> 00:26:48.059 align:start position:0%
that just never had a license and now
 
00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:49.980 align:start position:0%
they were getting their license
 
00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:52.020 align:start position:0%
are you recommending any driver's ed
 
00:26:54.169 --> 00:26:54.179 align:start position:0%
with them as well or there was talk of
 
00:26:56.269 --> 00:26:56.279 align:start position:0%
that but I don't think the appetite is
 
00:26:58.490 --> 00:26:58.500 align:start position:0%
there to have anything along those lines
 
00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
I mean I've had many I've had several
 
00:27:02.269 --> 00:27:02.279 align:start position:0%
students come from like a city
 
00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
environment I've never had to drive and
 
00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
I want to learn and they come to see me
 
00:27:07.909 --> 00:27:07.919 align:start position:0%
and I put them through you know 10 hours
 
00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:10.200 align:start position:0%
of of behind the wheel and Coach them
 
00:27:12.049 --> 00:27:12.059 align:start position:0%
about the rules and all that stuff and
 
00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
they're they're they do well so you do
 
00:27:16.549 --> 00:27:16.559 align:start position:0%
have some type of modified course for
 
00:27:18.409 --> 00:27:18.419 align:start position:0%
that absolutely okay absolutely okay
 
00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:24.409 --> 00:27:24.419 align:start position:0%
and and how affordable is that because I
 
00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
think oftentimes the student that Waits
 
00:27:30.049 --> 00:27:30.059 align:start position:0%
until they're 18 years old is because of
 
00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:32.400 align:start position:0%
the affordability and the accessibility
 
00:27:35.269 --> 00:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
for a driver education program and it
 
00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:37.740 align:start position:0%
depends on the person you know if if the
 
00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
person has gotten any if they let's say
 
00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
they're not no driving I recommend 10
 
00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
hours with us at 10 hours in the car
 
00:27:46.549 --> 00:27:46.559 align:start position:0%
with us that's up to them you know
 
00:27:48.289 --> 00:27:48.299 align:start position:0%
they're going to see how they feel and
 
00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:50.400 align:start position:0%
uh and that's up to them but we're
 
00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:52.380 align:start position:0%
trying to address the cost thing going
 
00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
through the director you know reached
 
00:27:57.769 --> 00:27:57.779 align:start position:0%
out and uh we had a teen or an eight uh
 
00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
he's probably 17 at the time was talking
 
00:28:01.549 --> 00:28:01.559 align:start position:0%
about he wrote a letter to the director
 
00:28:03.169 --> 00:28:03.179 align:start position:0%
saying he couldn't afford driver
 
00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:05.100 align:start position:0%
education well he director invited that
 
00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:07.500 align:start position:0%
teen in to speak to us all and we try to
 
00:28:09.529 --> 00:28:09.539 align:start position:0%
problem solve so how can we try to make
 
00:28:11.450 --> 00:28:11.460 align:start position:0%
it more affordable because back many
 
00:28:15.049 --> 00:28:15.059 align:start position:0%
years ago State paid a portion of driver
 
00:28:18.529 --> 00:28:18.539 align:start position:0%
education until like 2011
 
00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:20.580 align:start position:0%
um and now that that money is still in
 
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
law but it never comes to Dry Ridge
 
00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:22.810 align:start position:0%
law but it never comes to Dry Ridge
education

00:28:22.810 --> 00:28:22.820 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:25.320 align:start position:0%
but it uh
 
00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:27.890 align:start position:0%
but it uh
the

00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:27.900 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
lost my thought
 
00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:31.669 align:start position:0%
lost my thought
the

00:28:31.669 --> 00:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:33.240 align:start position:0%
the affordability we're trying to
 
00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:35.100 align:start position:0%
address with the scholarship program the
 
00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:36.900 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire auto dealers has a
 
00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
scholarship program for their mechanics
 
00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:41.400 align:start position:0%
that are coming in and they're already
 
00:28:43.669 --> 00:28:43.679 align:start position:0%
set up with with the type of an
 
00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:46.140 align:start position:0%
application and we were refining that
 
00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
application with
 
00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:51.480 align:start position:0%
them and the committee to try to we're
 
00:28:53.149 --> 00:28:53.159 align:start position:0%
not trying to exclude anybody we want to
 
00:28:55.549 --> 00:28:55.559 align:start position:0%
include as many as possible to get that
 
00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
scholarship program running they're
 
00:28:58.909 --> 00:28:58.919 align:start position:0%
going to ask each Driving School to
 
00:29:03.049 --> 00:29:03.059 align:start position:0%
donate if they can two seats in their
 
00:29:05.149 --> 00:29:05.159 align:start position:0%
school throughout each year and then
 
00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
they're going to do fundraising to the
 
00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:08.820 align:start position:0%
auto dealers and elsewhere in the
 
00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:11.100 align:start position:0%
community to try to create a fund that
 
00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:13.020 align:start position:0%
we that they won't have to turn anybody
 
00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
away and give them at least something to
 
00:29:17.269 --> 00:29:17.279 align:start position:0%
make them able to afford Drive red if
 
00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:20.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:22.669 --> 00:29:22.679 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate that and I think that's
 
00:29:24.049 --> 00:29:24.059 align:start position:0%
an Avenue where
 
00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:28.140 align:start position:0%
it it would be very beneficial to have
 
00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:31.860 align:start position:0%
more scholarships more ways to
 
00:29:33.889 --> 00:29:33.899 align:start position:0%
um to help these students I think it
 
00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
only benefits all of us in New Hampshire
 
00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:38.820 align:start position:0%
whether you're 18 or 21 years old and
 
00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:40.260 align:start position:0%
just getting your driver's license if
 
00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:42.440 align:start position:0%
you have some sort of formal instruction
 
00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
I also am not in favor of
 
00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
um uh creating a waiver based on number
 
00:29:52.549 --> 00:29:52.559 align:start position:0%
of hours that a parent helps their
 
00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
student I have first-hand experience
 
00:29:58.490 --> 00:29:58.500 align:start position:0%
teaching a student to drive who
 
00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
um had 25 30 hours with me and then
 
00:30:05.930 --> 00:30:05.940 align:start position:0%
you know uh went to their parents for
 
00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:07.980 align:start position:0%
the final 10 hours that they were
 
00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:10.740 align:start position:0%
required and unfortunately the parent
 
00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:13.620 align:start position:0%
fabricated the 10 hours in order for the
 
00:30:15.169 --> 00:30:15.179 align:start position:0%
student to get the driver's license and
 
00:30:16.909 --> 00:30:16.919 align:start position:0%
I think that happens more often than not
 
00:30:18.769 --> 00:30:18.779 align:start position:0%
I agree with you something I wouldn't do
 
00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
something you wouldn't do but it does
 
00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
happen as an example I have a a packet
 
00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:26.580 align:start position:0%
of paperwork to try to help the parents
 
00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559 align:start position:0%
when they're out with their team in that
 
00:30:30.769 --> 00:30:30.779 align:start position:0%
packet there are 11 checklist pages that
 
00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:32.580 align:start position:0%
I mandate they return in at the end of
 
00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:34.140 align:start position:0%
the course I have right on top but
 
00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
please don't put this away please start
 
00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
working on these things with your with
 
00:30:39.289 --> 00:30:39.299 align:start position:0%
your team it has all the skills and
 
00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:40.740 align:start position:0%
things that they're going to see and are
 
00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
they doing well with it or not doing
 
00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:44.940 align:start position:0%
well with it and I will tell you that
 
00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
probably half of those sheets are turned
 
00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:50.340 align:start position:0%
in the last night kids bringing them out
 
00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:53.640 align:start position:0%
to their parents to fill them out so I
 
00:30:56.090 --> 00:30:56.100 align:start position:0%
agree with you 100 it's you know there's
 
00:30:58.730 --> 00:30:58.740 align:start position:0%
no control on on you know we can say
 
00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
that they've got to have this but they
 
00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:05.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:07.980 align:start position:0%
so right now my understanding is anybody
 
00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:10.860 align:start position:0%
over 18 it's not required they take any
 
00:31:14.149 --> 00:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
driving test or anything private
 
00:31:15.529 --> 00:31:15.539 align:start position:0%
education at all there's no driver
 
00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
education 18 you can go in on your 18th
 
00:31:19.549 --> 00:31:19.559 align:start position:0%
birthday say I want my license and go
 
00:31:21.649 --> 00:31:21.659 align:start position:0%
take the knowledge test if you pass it
 
00:31:24.289 --> 00:31:24.299 align:start position:0%
then you'd schedule a driving exam and
 
00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
and go through that but and I just want
 
00:31:29.810 --> 00:31:29.820 align:start position:0%
to clarify the uh I'd either I missed it
 
00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:31.860 align:start position:0%
I didn't hear it what was the cost if
 
00:31:33.169 --> 00:31:33.179 align:start position:0%
someone wanted to do at least those 10
 
00:31:35.389 --> 00:31:35.399 align:start position:0%
hours uh the the person coming out
 
00:31:38.269 --> 00:31:38.279 align:start position:0%
outside uh for 10 hours right now it's
 
00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:41.460 align:start position:0%
110 an hour because of uh the cost for
 
00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:43.860 align:start position:0%
cars I've got you know 100 000 or
 
00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
dollars in or more more than that in in
 
00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:48.480 align:start position:0%
vehicles right now and insurance so
 
00:31:49.610 --> 00:31:49.620 align:start position:0%
you're talking eleven hundred dollars
 
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
basically yes yes where is it where is
 
00:31:53.690 --> 00:31:53.700 align:start position:0%
it it's someone that goes to Driver's Ed
 
00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
is around seven or eight hundred yes
 
00:31:58.010 --> 00:31:58.020 align:start position:0%
yeah as I've seen some schools as high
 
00:32:00.049 --> 00:32:00.059 align:start position:0%
as a thousand uh
 
00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
um but they're they're in that ballpark
 
00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:06.200 align:start position:0%
seven eight eight hundred to 900 General
 
00:32:08.570 --> 00:32:08.580 align:start position:0%
general rule
 
00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:11.460 align:start position:0%
and the scholarship the scholarship
 
00:32:13.010 --> 00:32:13.020 align:start position:0%
program I think is going to be awesome
 
00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
and it's supposed to roll out anytime
 
00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:16.020 align:start position:0%
now they've been we've been working on
 
00:32:17.570 --> 00:32:17.580 align:start position:0%
it quite a while and it should be and
 
00:32:20.149 --> 00:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
that's from who the Donald well the Auto
 
00:32:22.610 --> 00:32:22.620 align:start position:0%
Dealers Association offered to host it
 
00:32:25.210 --> 00:32:25.220 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a basically it's a it's a
 
00:32:27.529 --> 00:32:27.539 align:start position:0%
development from the driver task force
 
00:32:29.029 --> 00:32:29.039 align:start position:0%
where can how can we do this or whatever
 
00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
and they stepped up saying we already do
 
00:32:33.289 --> 00:32:33.299 align:start position:0%
the one for the mechanics and it's an
 
00:32:36.169 --> 00:32:36.179 align:start position:0%
online form they fill out and you know
 
00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:37.500 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a Review Committee
 
00:32:39.409 --> 00:32:39.419 align:start position:0%
to see what you know we aren't looking
 
00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:41.100 align:start position:0%
for financials or anything like that
 
00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
because that was a big conversation you
 
00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:44.720 align:start position:0%
know how deep do we want to go
 
00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:47.340 align:start position:0%
to see if someone's going to be eligible
 
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
and we just ask them to tell us about
 
00:32:51.529 --> 00:32:51.539 align:start position:0%
their situation and uh and and we go
 
00:32:52.669 --> 00:32:52.679 align:start position:0%
from there
 
00:32:55.250 --> 00:32:55.260 align:start position:0%
all right thank you and you go ahead and
 
00:32:58.730 --> 00:32:58.740 align:start position:0%
just a comment because I I think you
 
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
know at a hundred and ten dollars an
 
00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
hour I think that's where our problem
 
00:33:05.029 --> 00:33:05.039 align:start position:0%
that's where our problem lies that's why
 
00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:08.940 align:start position:0%
there's so much effort into
 
00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:11.820 align:start position:0%
um uh trying to create a waiver for
 
00:33:14.889 --> 00:33:14.899 align:start position:0%
parents I think you know at 18 years old
 
00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:17.100 align:start position:0%
if you haven't been able to afford
 
00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
driver education up until that point and
 
00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
now you want to take a you know a
 
00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:23.820 align:start position:0%
10-hour course that's going to cost you
 
00:33:27.049 --> 00:33:27.059 align:start position:0%
more than the driver education
 
00:33:29.269 --> 00:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
with the 18 year olds that are coming
 
00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:31.140 align:start position:0%
quite often have been working and such
 
00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
so it's it's not you you know I try to
 
00:33:35.029 --> 00:33:35.039 align:start position:0%
look at the person and say you know
 
00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
what's you know what's going on and it's
 
00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:38.700 align:start position:0%
if they're if Financial is if it's a
 
00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:40.500 align:start position:0%
financial issue I always try to help
 
00:33:43.669 --> 00:33:43.679 align:start position:0%
them out you know it's it's not uh but I
 
00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:46.260 align:start position:0%
have plenty of people who are 18 20 or
 
00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:47.580 align:start position:0%
whatever they're out on their own and
 
00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:49.140 align:start position:0%
they're working and they're doing okay
 
00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:52.380 align:start position:0%
and um you know that's that's you know
 
00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
the costs that we have to keep things
 
00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
running in my time with 40 years
 
00:33:59.690 --> 00:33:59.700 align:start position:0%
experience is worth something
 
00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:01.140 align:start position:0%
um that I can help them and I can bring
 
00:34:04.610 --> 00:34:04.620 align:start position:0%
them up to a a reasonable level uh in a
 
00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:06.360 align:start position:0%
short amount of time and I don't often
 
00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
have to do 10 but the person who has
 
00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
zero experience no never driven behind
 
00:34:16.430 --> 00:34:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:17.580 align:start position:0%
um has it ever been looked at because
 
00:34:19.129 --> 00:34:19.139 align:start position:0%
I'm just thinking the economics of
 
00:34:20.869 --> 00:34:20.879 align:start position:0%
multiple children somebody has four or
 
00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
five kids and you know now and that's
 
00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
becoming you know two degree more
 
00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:27.300 align:start position:0%
popular nowadays you know in some
 
00:34:29.450 --> 00:34:29.460 align:start position:0%
circles and and they have them in quick
 
00:34:31.369 --> 00:34:31.379 align:start position:0%
succession so you have five kids
 
00:34:34.129 --> 00:34:34.139 align:start position:0%
thousand bucks a piece going has have
 
00:34:35.869 --> 00:34:35.879 align:start position:0%
you guys looked into any any kind of
 
00:34:38.089 --> 00:34:38.099 align:start position:0%
program where like in my mind I can
 
00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:40.260 align:start position:0%
you know like a parent goes takes a
 
00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
course from you goes one time and then
 
00:34:46.010 --> 00:34:46.020 align:start position:0%
they've kind of gotten this lecture you
 
00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
know I I hate not lecture but you know
 
00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:49.560 align:start position:0%
they've gotten the seriousness of what
 
00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:52.020 align:start position:0%
the tasks they're about to embark on
 
00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
um if they teach their kid driver
 
00:34:55.669 --> 00:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
Driver's Ed has that has that ever been
 
00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:57.720 align:start position:0%
looked at because then a family can go
 
00:35:00.290 --> 00:35:00.300 align:start position:0%
in once and I mean not everybody's going
 
00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:01.800 align:start position:0%
to take advantage I still think you guys
 
00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:03.180 align:start position:0%
will have plenty of people coming
 
00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:04.130 align:start position:0%
will have plenty of people coming
through

00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:04.140 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:07.800 align:start position:0%
um but this gives a in my head in my
 
00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:09.720 align:start position:0%
mind a responsible parent who wants to
 
00:35:11.329 --> 00:35:11.339 align:start position:0%
come in take it seriously take a course
 
00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:16.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:18.349 --> 00:35:18.359 align:start position:0%
when we were first talking about this
 
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
when I when the driveway task force
 
00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:23.700 align:start position:0%
started I sent out a um a survey to all
 
00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:25.320 align:start position:0%
my parents for the last couple classes
 
00:35:27.109 --> 00:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
saying hey there's thoughts out there of
 
00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:28.200 align:start position:0%
starting a parent-taught driver
 
00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:30.900 align:start position:0%
education and
 
00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
um I think I had like 90 that said not a
 
00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:36.710 align:start position:0%
um I think I had like 90 that said not a
chance

00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
chance
 
00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
um and I had 10 percent who are
 
00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
struggling with sports schedules and
 
00:35:40.849 --> 00:35:40.859 align:start position:0%
they're you know working three jobs and
 
00:35:43.609 --> 00:35:43.619 align:start position:0%
all those they would be the worst ones
 
00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:46.020 align:start position:0%
to not have the time to do it but they
 
00:35:47.810 --> 00:35:47.820 align:start position:0%
said well I can see why because of the
 
00:35:49.490 --> 00:35:49.500 align:start position:0%
kids schedules and things that we they
 
00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:52.020 align:start position:0%
would want to do that but
 
00:35:55.010 --> 00:35:55.020 align:start position:0%
um I I wouldn't recommend it I still am
 
00:35:57.589 --> 00:35:57.599 align:start position:0%
you know very opposed to doing it but I
 
00:35:59.390 --> 00:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
understand there's other stakeholders
 
00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:06.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:09.290 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:36:09.290 --> 00:36:09.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:12.660 align:start position:0%
what is the cost for an or you can give
 
00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
me a ballpark for an instructor to go
 
00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:17.880 align:start position:0%
through the program right now uh each of
 
00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:21.660 align:start position:0%
the three initial courses uh there's two
 
00:36:23.569 --> 00:36:23.579 align:start position:0%
that are 705 dollars and the third one
 
00:36:25.310 --> 00:36:25.320 align:start position:0%
is eight eight fifty five because we
 
00:36:26.930 --> 00:36:26.940 align:start position:0%
have the in-person day they have they
 
00:36:28.730 --> 00:36:28.740 align:start position:0%
charge a lot the college charges a lab
 
00:36:30.069 --> 00:36:30.079 align:start position:0%
fee for that day
 
00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:33.240 align:start position:0%
so to get them started we're twenty two
 
00:36:35.569 --> 00:36:35.579 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars of thereabouts uh to get
 
00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
them through the program and as we said
 
00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:40.260 align:start position:0%
uh the uh
 
00:36:42.109 --> 00:36:42.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of Labor has
 
00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
recognized that it's as a need so they
 
00:36:47.569 --> 00:36:47.579 align:start position:0%
are going to be funding 50 of the
 
00:36:50.569 --> 00:36:50.579 align:start position:0%
tuition for a new instructor to get the
 
00:36:53.450 --> 00:36:53.460 align:start position:0%
uh get through the program so that's
 
00:36:54.829 --> 00:36:54.839 align:start position:0%
going to be a huge help to the driving
 
00:36:54.839 --> 00:36:56.750 align:start position:0%
going to be a huge help to the driving
schools

00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:37:02.810 --> 00:37:02.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
so the Department of Labor is going to
 
00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:06.540 align:start position:0%
actually ship in 50 of that so
 
00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
technically they'll get reimbursed 1100
 
00:37:14.450 --> 00:37:14.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
and do we know how many instructors that
 
00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:19.140 align:start position:0%
we have right now are uh I defer to
 
00:37:21.349 --> 00:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
people Lieutenant O'Leary might know
 
00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:22.740 align:start position:0%
that number
 
00:37:24.770 --> 00:37:24.780 align:start position:0%
good morning sir uh Lieutenant Larry
 
00:37:27.829 --> 00:37:27.839 align:start position:0%
with troopchi So currently we have a
 
00:37:31.490 --> 00:37:31.500 align:start position:0%
total of 245 certified instructors
 
00:37:33.410 --> 00:37:33.420 align:start position:0%
um to put that into perspective when we
 
00:37:35.329 --> 00:37:35.339 align:start position:0%
left this session here last year we
 
00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
certainly heard the message of
 
00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
affordability affordability and
 
00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:40.740 align:start position:0%
availability and you've heard uh Mr
 
00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
gissette speak to the the classes the
 
00:37:45.050 --> 00:37:45.060 align:start position:0%
reduction working with the Department of
 
00:37:47.089 --> 00:37:47.099 align:start position:0%
Labor to get that part addressed with
 
00:37:47.099 --> 00:37:48.650 align:start position:0%
Labor to get that part addressed with
instructors

00:37:48.650 --> 00:37:48.660 align:start position:0%
instructors
 
00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:51.420 align:start position:0%
um we've uh worked on our own internal
 
00:37:54.170 --> 00:37:54.180 align:start position:0%
processes to help speed up the
 
00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
certification process because when we
 
00:37:58.430 --> 00:37:58.440 align:start position:0%
left here last year the certification
 
00:38:00.770 --> 00:38:00.780 align:start position:0%
process took approximately three months
 
00:38:02.210 --> 00:38:02.220 align:start position:0%
from an instructor from the time they've
 
00:38:03.829 --> 00:38:03.839 align:start position:0%
completed the class to the time in which
 
00:38:05.930 --> 00:38:05.940 align:start position:0%
they receive our certification was about
 
00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:07.500 align:start position:0%
three months and you can imagine as a
 
00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
school owner in these times it's
 
00:38:11.210 --> 00:38:11.220 align:start position:0%
difficult to have somebody on ice for 90
 
00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
days we were able to reevaluate that
 
00:38:15.290 --> 00:38:15.300 align:start position:0%
process and reduce that wait time to
 
00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
five days so the time in which they
 
00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
finish the college class the time in
 
00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:21.060 align:start position:0%
which they've taken the test at the DMV
 
00:38:23.210 --> 00:38:23.220 align:start position:0%
and received their certification is done
 
00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
now within five days as a result we've
 
00:38:28.490 --> 00:38:28.500 align:start position:0%
seen in less than a year 25 new
 
00:38:30.170 --> 00:38:30.180 align:start position:0%
instructors that I've gotten into
 
00:38:33.770 --> 00:38:33.780 align:start position:0%
drivers education we've seen three new
 
00:38:35.390 --> 00:38:35.400 align:start position:0%
locations that have opened and we have
 
00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
three more locations that are pending so
 
00:38:40.069 --> 00:38:40.079 align:start position:0%
to date we have 74 schools we'll have
 
00:38:43.130 --> 00:38:43.140 align:start position:0%
just over that here shortly those three
 
00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:45.480 align:start position:0%
additional schools that are pending are
 
00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
in Prime areas such as Meredith Windham
 
00:38:50.089 --> 00:38:50.099 align:start position:0%
and Nashua which will help reduce the
 
00:38:52.609 --> 00:38:52.619 align:start position:0%
the stress of you know the the call and
 
00:38:55.010 --> 00:38:55.020 align:start position:0%
need for instructors or instruction in
 
00:38:57.770 --> 00:38:57.780 align:start position:0%
that area so I think this illustrates
 
00:38:59.930 --> 00:38:59.940 align:start position:0%
that some of the steps that we've made
 
00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
to help make these improvements are
 
00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
already paying off where we see this you
 
00:39:05.329 --> 00:39:05.339 align:start position:0%
know the additional instructors and
 
00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:16.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:18.410 --> 00:39:18.420 align:start position:0%
okay anything that we
 
00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:20.280 align:start position:0%
should know that we don't know that we
 
00:39:22.609 --> 00:39:22.619 align:start position:0%
didn't ask how's that you know there's
 
00:39:24.410 --> 00:39:24.420 align:start position:0%
always that only last thing I would
 
00:39:26.329 --> 00:39:26.339 align:start position:0%
mention is you know yes it is expensive
 
00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:28.200 align:start position:0%
at driver education but if if you break
 
00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
it down that we're with each student
 
00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
about 46 hours
 
00:39:35.390 --> 00:39:35.400 align:start position:0%
um you know per per hour rate
 
00:39:38.810 --> 00:39:38.820 align:start position:0%
it's not that high per student
 
00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
if you break it down and you're usually
 
00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:42.180 align:start position:0%
having two or three students in a
 
00:39:43.849 --> 00:39:43.859 align:start position:0%
vehicle and that's I I usually have I
 
00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:46.260 align:start position:0%
usually Drive in pairs in my school but
 
00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
yes a lot of schools are two or three in
 
00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
the skin so one hour observing and one
 
00:39:55.010 --> 00:39:55.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:58.069 --> 00:39:58.079 align:start position:0%
yes sir just uh one last Point
 
00:40:00.290 --> 00:40:00.300 align:start position:0%
um one item to consider as well is the
 
00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
positive impact that this have on our
 
00:40:04.849 --> 00:40:04.859 align:start position:0%
apparent drivers because you know
 
00:40:06.410 --> 00:40:06.420 align:start position:0%
currently once you take driver education
 
00:40:07.849 --> 00:40:07.859 align:start position:0%
you get your driver's license never
 
00:40:09.829 --> 00:40:09.839 align:start position:0%
again are you put in a course or class
 
00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
discuss changes in laws so when you have
 
00:40:13.730 --> 00:40:13.740 align:start position:0%
a parent that's been driving for 20 to
 
00:40:16.130 --> 00:40:16.140 align:start position:0%
30 years I know it seems enticing to
 
00:40:17.569 --> 00:40:17.579 align:start position:0%
have that type of person or the parent
 
00:40:19.730 --> 00:40:19.740 align:start position:0%
be able to offer the instruction as you
 
00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:21.240 align:start position:0%
can imagine what's happening is just
 
00:40:23.450 --> 00:40:23.460 align:start position:0%
like the reverse role where the the
 
00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:25.140 align:start position:0%
student is coming home and discussing
 
00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
these new laws and things with their
 
00:40:29.690 --> 00:40:29.700 align:start position:0%
parents so there is a great Avenue here
 
00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
that is allowing us to capture those
 
00:40:34.069 --> 00:40:34.079 align:start position:0%
that haven't been in you know reading a
 
00:40:36.109 --> 00:40:36.119 align:start position:0%
textbook or paying attention to new laws
 
00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
this Avenue allows us to get some of
 
00:40:40.849 --> 00:40:40.859 align:start position:0%
that information regarding like texting
 
00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
and driving and all those types of laws
 
00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
that have changed since they've started
 
00:40:46.730 --> 00:40:46.740 align:start position:0%
driving it gets that information to them
 
00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
so we use that as that Avenue
 
00:40:52.190 --> 00:40:52.200 align:start position:0%
yeah very good points thank you
 
00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
all right well thank you thank you very
 
00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.010 align:start position:0%
all right well thank you thank you very
much

00:40:55.010 --> 00:40:55.020 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:40:57.290 --> 00:40:57.300 align:start position:0%
would anybody else like to come up and
 
00:41:00.770 --> 00:41:00.780 align:start position:0%
share anything on driver's ed
 
00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
Now isn't it there we go
 
00:41:15.530 --> 00:41:15.540 align:start position:0%
um you'll probably remember me but I'm
 
00:41:17.569 --> 00:41:17.579 align:start position:0%
Tracy boravage I'm the president of New
 
00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire motorcycle rides okay
 
00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
um I'm also the chair of the New
 
00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire newly formed about a couple
 
00:41:27.050 --> 00:41:27.060 align:start position:0%
years ago newly formed motorcycle safety
 
00:41:29.210 --> 00:41:29.220 align:start position:0%
task force for the state and I sit on
 
00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
the traffic commission representing
 
00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
motorcyclists and we are extremely
 
00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:36.720 align:start position:0%
opposed to parental teaching of driver's
 
00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:37.490 align:start position:0%
opposed to parental teaching of driver's
ed

00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:37.500 align:start position:0%
ed
 
00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:39.720 align:start position:0%
the main reason is that most parents
 
00:41:41.569 --> 00:41:41.579 align:start position:0%
have no clue how to teach their children
 
00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
how to ride in and around motorcycles
 
00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
much less an 18-wheeler and that's
 
00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
something that actually nhmro got
 
00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
accomplished 20 years ago was having
 
00:41:53.089 --> 00:41:53.099 align:start position:0%
instruction for the motorcyclist as well
 
00:41:56.450 --> 00:41:56.460 align:start position:0%
as 18 wheelers in the driver's education
 
00:41:59.349 --> 00:41:59.359 align:start position:0%
program we also participate with them
 
00:42:02.329 --> 00:42:02.339 align:start position:0%
October 14th as a matter of fact myself
 
00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:04.140 align:start position:0%
and Emory Slaughter who does our ride
 
00:42:05.810 --> 00:42:05.820 align:start position:0%
smart program which I think you'll have
 
00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:06.770 align:start position:0%
smart program which I think you'll have
seen

00:42:06.770 --> 00:42:06.780 align:start position:0%
seen
 
00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:08.700 align:start position:0%
before but I will show it to you real
 
00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:10.069 align:start position:0%
before but I will show it to you real
quick

00:42:10.069 --> 00:42:10.079 align:start position:0%
quick
 
00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:11.820 align:start position:0%
we will be speaking to the driver's
 
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
education instructors all of them to
 
00:42:18.050 --> 00:42:18.060 align:start position:0%
educate them on the motorcycling needs
 
00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
and issues how to drive in and around
 
00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
motorcycles and we do this typically
 
00:42:24.890 --> 00:42:24.900 align:start position:0%
once a year with the instructors I don't
 
00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
know how you would do that with parents
 
00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:29.160 align:start position:0%
and again like I said most parents would
 
00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:31.560 align:start position:0%
have no clue how to teach young drivers
 
00:42:34.010 --> 00:42:34.020 align:start position:0%
how to drive in and around motorcycles
 
00:42:38.089 --> 00:42:38.099 align:start position:0%
so as a motorcyclist I implore you to
 
00:42:40.010 --> 00:42:40.020 align:start position:0%
really consider that the other thing I'd
 
00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:42.540 align:start position:0%
like to comment on is as a parent and a
 
00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:43.849 align:start position:0%
like to comment on is as a parent and a
motorcyclist

00:42:43.849 --> 00:42:43.859 align:start position:0%
motorcyclist
 
00:42:46.550 --> 00:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
I still wouldn't have wanted to teach my
 
00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:49.260 align:start position:0%
son how to do that I think that there's
 
00:42:51.530 --> 00:42:51.540 align:start position:0%
a reason that we have instructors and I
 
00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:53.640 align:start position:0%
totally respect the idea of
 
00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
homeschooling kids but you're putting
 
00:42:57.710 --> 00:42:57.720 align:start position:0%
kids in vehicles that they can kill
 
00:42:59.450 --> 00:42:59.460 align:start position:0%
somebody or themselves it's a big
 
00:43:00.890 --> 00:43:00.900 align:start position:0%
difference between that and
 
00:43:02.329 --> 00:43:02.339 align:start position:0%
homeschooling and teaching them and
 
00:43:03.829 --> 00:43:03.839 align:start position:0%
education of
 
00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:06.660 align:start position:0%
math so that's all I have to say have
 
00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:09.960 align:start position:0%
any questions that I can answer
 
00:43:12.650 --> 00:43:12.660 align:start position:0%
so my initial thought was this is uh
 
00:43:14.809 --> 00:43:14.819 align:start position:0%
just instructions on vehicles and not
 
00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
necessarily motorcycles I didn't I
 
00:43:18.410 --> 00:43:18.420 align:start position:0%
didn't even think about motorcycles but
 
00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:20.040 align:start position:0%
thanks for bringing that up
 
00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:26.220 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time
 
00:43:30.589 --> 00:43:30.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:30.599 --> 00:43:32.569 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:43:32.569 --> 00:43:32.579 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:43:32.579 --> 00:43:33.650 align:start position:0%
okay
um

00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:33.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:35.700 align:start position:0%
let's I just want to talk Among Us also
 
00:43:36.589 --> 00:43:36.599 align:start position:0%
and then first of all I want to
 
00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:38.640 align:start position:0%
apologize we did not pledge the leading
 
00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:40.740 align:start position:0%
us this morning my bad I haven't been
 
00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:43.020 align:start position:0%
doing this very often so we'll we'll
 
00:43:46.069 --> 00:43:46.079 align:start position:0%
figure it out but any case
 
00:43:48.109 --> 00:43:48.119 align:start position:0%
do you guys want to discuss this at all
 
00:43:51.349 --> 00:43:51.359 align:start position:0%
right now or you know if any ideas any
 
00:43:54.410 --> 00:43:54.420 align:start position:0%
thoughts as far as
 
00:43:55.849 --> 00:43:55.859 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:43:57.890 --> 00:43:57.900 align:start position:0%
the Perpetual you know the proposal I
 
00:43:59.030 --> 00:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
just think
 
00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
there still needs to be a lot of a lot
 
00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:03.720 align:start position:0%
of work a lot of homework done a lot
 
00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:04.670 align:start position:0%
of work a lot of homework done a lot
more

00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:04.680 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:08.390 align:start position:0%
more
um

00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:11.880 align:start position:0%
a lot more participation a lot more uh
 
00:44:16.370 --> 00:44:16.380 align:start position:0%
definitive answers on on creating more
 
00:44:18.349 --> 00:44:18.359 align:start position:0%
schools more affordability more
 
00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:25.849 --> 00:44:25.859 align:start position:0%
I mean I'd I'd love to see more work
 
00:44:27.950 --> 00:44:27.960 align:start position:0%
done on possibly bringing some kind of
 
00:44:29.930 --> 00:44:29.940 align:start position:0%
hybrid system together
 
00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
um because I do see the value in
 
00:44:33.890 --> 00:44:33.900 align:start position:0%
traditional Driver's Ed but you know and
 
00:44:35.690 --> 00:44:35.700 align:start position:0%
I come from an aviation background I've
 
00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:38.700 align:start position:0%
taught people to fly very large Airlines
 
00:44:43.550 --> 00:44:43.560 align:start position:0%
and you know I think the you know I I
 
00:44:45.589 --> 00:44:45.599 align:start position:0%
think where the parents are actually
 
00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
really helpful in a lot of this is you
 
00:44:49.370 --> 00:44:49.380 align:start position:0%
know you're in the car with your kids
 
00:44:50.809 --> 00:44:50.819 align:start position:0%
you're going to see a million scenarios
 
00:44:52.490 --> 00:44:52.500 align:start position:0%
and it's going to be more realistic
 
00:44:53.870 --> 00:44:53.880 align:start position:0%
scenarios and that's kind of in the
 
00:44:55.010 --> 00:44:55.020 align:start position:0%
aviation industry that's what we've
 
00:44:57.290 --> 00:44:57.300 align:start position:0%
moved into is instead of doing the row
 
00:44:59.210 --> 00:44:59.220 align:start position:0%
you know procedures all the time we we
 
00:45:00.890 --> 00:45:00.900 align:start position:0%
go into realistic scenarios on a
 
00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
realistic you know
 
00:45:04.609 --> 00:45:04.619 align:start position:0%
um situations and I think as a parent
 
00:45:07.010 --> 00:45:07.020 align:start position:0%
you have so much time with your kids for
 
00:45:08.990 --> 00:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
years and years and years I I think that
 
00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
gives you you know that that gives you a
 
00:45:13.069 --> 00:45:13.079 align:start position:0%
little bit more of an ability to kind of
 
00:45:15.349 --> 00:45:15.359 align:start position:0%
demonstrate some of those scenarios and
 
00:45:16.730 --> 00:45:16.740 align:start position:0%
um the motorcycles I mean up in the
 
00:45:18.349 --> 00:45:18.359 align:start position:0%
Lakes Region we have so many motorcycles
 
00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
it's ridiculous I mean it's it's it's
 
00:45:22.370 --> 00:45:22.380 align:start position:0%
you've got to watch out but my kids now
 
00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
have you know like if they're they even
 
00:45:27.050 --> 00:45:27.060 align:start position:0%
watch for them they'll be like but yeah
 
00:45:28.670 --> 00:45:28.680 align:start position:0%
there's motorcycle coming up you know so
 
00:45:30.730 --> 00:45:30.740 align:start position:0%
I think saying that
 
00:45:32.809 --> 00:45:32.819 align:start position:0%
parents have something to impart on
 
00:45:33.710 --> 00:45:33.720 align:start position:0%
their children
 
00:45:35.870 --> 00:45:35.880 align:start position:0%
um so I don't know I've loved to work on
 
00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:37.380 align:start position:0%
this a little bit more
 
00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:40.200 align:start position:0%
um somehow and maybe get something going
 
00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
how do you envision like a hybrid system
 
00:45:47.569 --> 00:45:47.579 align:start position:0%
any thoughts I I mean that's thinking
 
00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
out loud it's dangerous
 
00:45:51.589 --> 00:45:51.599 align:start position:0%
um but um I don't know I I just think
 
00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
you know kind of almost like a
 
00:45:55.309 --> 00:45:55.319 align:start position:0%
checkpoint system which would be some
 
00:45:57.349 --> 00:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
kind of an interesting you know you give
 
00:45:59.630 --> 00:45:59.640 align:start position:0%
it you give a parent a syllabus you know
 
00:46:01.010 --> 00:46:01.020 align:start position:0%
that's developed by one of the schools
 
00:46:03.589 --> 00:46:03.599 align:start position:0%
and it's got three phases and the parent
 
00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
has to go in and do these hours because
 
00:46:07.490 --> 00:46:07.500 align:start position:0%
like what was mentioned is you get a
 
00:46:09.530 --> 00:46:09.540 align:start position:0%
huge checklist of stuff and I know as an
 
00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:11.640 align:start position:0%
instructor sometimes you know we would
 
00:46:13.490 --> 00:46:13.500 align:start position:0%
get gosh like 80 things to check off
 
00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:15.720 align:start position:0%
well you only have so much time and it
 
00:46:17.450 --> 00:46:17.460 align:start position:0%
is what it is so I think if you break it
 
00:46:19.849 --> 00:46:19.859 align:start position:0%
up into little phases
 
00:46:21.230 --> 00:46:21.240 align:start position:0%
um and then maybe check in with an
 
00:46:23.329 --> 00:46:23.339 align:start position:0%
instructor at that point and if the
 
00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:25.020 align:start position:0%
parents teaching it possibly have the
 
00:46:26.569 --> 00:46:26.579 align:start position:0%
parent involved you know have to go with
 
00:46:28.130 --> 00:46:28.140 align:start position:0%
the instructor I mean I I just think
 
00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
there's options to look into
 
00:46:33.050 --> 00:46:33.060 align:start position:0%
um and if again if we could make it so
 
00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
one parent can go through a course and
 
00:46:36.650 --> 00:46:36.660 align:start position:0%
teach their five kids I mean that that's
 
00:46:39.290 --> 00:46:39.300 align:start position:0%
a huge burden lifted off but not have to
 
00:46:41.270 --> 00:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
go through the whole instructor process
 
00:46:44.089 --> 00:46:44.099 align:start position:0%
so that brings me back to uh Mr dessert
 
00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
uh question is is there any opportunity
 
00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
for a hybrid system where the parents
 
00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
can do some of this they do now at this
 
00:46:54.530 --> 00:46:54.540 align:start position:0%
point I get it they do the 40 hours now
 
00:46:56.809 --> 00:46:56.819 align:start position:0%
but is there a possibility that they
 
00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
could actually uh do a a hybrid system
 
00:47:03.470 --> 00:47:03.480 align:start position:0%
of hey you know what we can give you 20
 
00:47:05.089 --> 00:47:05.099 align:start position:0%
hours of training or 10 hours of
 
00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
training instead of the 40 hours on
 
00:47:10.490 --> 00:47:10.500 align:start position:0%
driver's ed If the parents put in you
 
00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
know say 80 hours of Drive Time versus
 
00:47:20.750 --> 00:47:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:20.760 --> 00:48:06.490 align:start position:0%
 
are

00:48:06.490 --> 00:48:06.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:10.250 --> 00:48:10.260 align:start position:0%
so so right now we don't we don't have
 
00:48:12.650 --> 00:48:12.660 align:start position:0%
any option or no hybrids out of that
 
00:48:15.109 --> 00:48:15.119 align:start position:0%
right you have to either take the course
 
00:48:17.930 --> 00:48:17.940 align:start position:0%
or not take the course okay all right
 
00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
thank you yes sir
 
00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:56.170 align:start position:0%
thank you yes sir
foreign

00:48:56.170 --> 00:48:56.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:58.250 --> 00:48:58.260 align:start position:0%
thank you sir
 
00:49:03.349 --> 00:49:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
any other thoughts for today
 
00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:06.230 align:start position:0%
any other thoughts for today
um

00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:08.809 --> 00:49:08.819 align:start position:0%
I think we could uh I I don't want to
 
00:49:10.730 --> 00:49:10.740 align:start position:0%
make a decision today I just want us to
 
00:49:12.770 --> 00:49:12.780 align:start position:0%
think about it and maybe just come back
 
00:49:14.450 --> 00:49:14.460 align:start position:0%
for one more meeting and then just call
 
00:49:16.309 --> 00:49:16.319 align:start position:0%
it you know decide what we're gonna do
 
00:49:18.650 --> 00:49:18.660 align:start position:0%
is that all right
 
00:49:21.230 --> 00:49:21.240 align:start position:0%
all right and I'm gonna no other
 
00:49:24.589 --> 00:49:24.599 align:start position:0%
thoughts anybody else going once okay

order
 
01:06:23.150 --> 01:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
and uh we'll start with the Pledge of
 
01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:27.309 align:start position:0%
and uh we'll start with the Pledge of
Allegiance

01:06:27.309 --> 01:06:27.319 align:start position:0%

I pledge allegiance to the flag of the
 
01:06:33.049 --> 01:06:33.059 align:start position:0%
United States of America and to the
 
01:06:36.289 --> 01:06:36.299 align:start position:0%
Republic which stands one nation under
 
01:06:39.470 --> 01:06:39.480 align:start position:0%
God indivisible with liberty and justice
 
01:06:47.210 --> 01:06:47.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:52.130 --> 01:06:52.140 align:start position:0%
okay we're working on House Bill 370
 
01:06:57.109 --> 01:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
and House Bill 357 or 537.
 
01:06:59.809 --> 01:06:59.819 align:start position:0%
both have to do with thinning of Windows
 
01:07:03.410 --> 01:07:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:04.730 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:07:04.730 --> 01:07:04.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:07.370 --> 01:07:07.380 align:start position:0%
you have something to begin with there
 
01:07:10.329 --> 01:07:10.339 align:start position:0%
uh no
 
01:07:13.549 --> 01:07:13.559 align:start position:0%

I'm certainly Mr chairman
um

um
 
01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
I think what would be best is if we
 
01:07:21.890 --> 01:07:21.900 align:start position:0%
we took a look at the
 
01:07:25.910 --> 01:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
the report that came back through
 
01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:26.569 align:start position:0%
the report that came back through
um

01:07:26.569 --> 01:07:26.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:28.309 --> 01:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
the department
 
01:07:31.190 --> 01:07:31.200 align:start position:0%
and especially uh work from the last
 
01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:32.569 align:start position:0%
and especially uh work from the last
page

01:07:32.569 --> 01:07:32.579 align:start position:0%
page
 
01:07:32.579 --> 01:07:33.950 align:start position:0%
page
um

01:07:33.950 --> 01:07:33.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:38.930 --> 01:07:38.940 align:start position:0%
dealing with uh RSA 266 call in 61-a for
 
01:07:42.109 --> 01:07:42.119 align:start position:0%
equipment waiver for disabled
 
01:07:44.690 --> 01:07:44.700 align:start position:0%
and maybe uh
 
01:07:46.609 --> 01:07:46.619 align:start position:0%
ask who's ever here from the Department
 
01:07:49.309 --> 01:07:49.319 align:start position:0%
that's willing to answer any questions
 
01:07:49.319 --> 01:07:50.750 align:start position:0%
that's willing to answer any questions
about

so
 
01:08:47.570 --> 01:08:47.580 align:start position:0%
um what we're dealing with
 
01:08:50.269 --> 01:08:50.279 align:start position:0%
um is trying to create
 
01:08:53.990 --> 01:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
as far as I can see try to create a
 
01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.849 align:start position:0%
as far as I can see try to create a
uniform

01:08:55.849 --> 01:08:55.859 align:start position:0%
uniform
 
01:08:55.859 --> 01:08:56.630 align:start position:0%
uniform
um

01:08:56.630 --> 01:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:59.930 --> 01:08:59.940 align:start position:0%
set of regulations not contradictory in
 
01:09:01.749 --> 01:09:01.759 align:start position:0%
different rsas
 
01:09:05.809 --> 01:09:05.819 align:start position:0%
dealing specifically with
 
01:09:10.450 --> 01:09:10.460 align:start position:0%
um the aftermarket tent of windshield
 
01:09:13.669 --> 01:09:13.679 align:start position:0%
and the two windows on either side of
 
01:09:14.689 --> 01:09:14.699 align:start position:0%
the driver
 
01:09:14.699 --> 01:09:16.550 align:start position:0%
the driver
right

01:09:16.550 --> 01:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:17.209 align:start position:0%
right
um

01:09:17.209 --> 01:09:17.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:20.269 --> 01:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
I also understand that we're currently
 
01:09:20.279 --> 01:09:22.450 align:start position:0%
I also understand that we're currently
have

01:09:22.450 --> 01:09:22.460 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:09:26.030 --> 01:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
federal regulations for the two windows
 
01:09:29.030 --> 01:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
on either side I don't know if we have
 
01:09:32.030 --> 01:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
Federal Federal Regulations dealing with
 
01:09:35.630 --> 01:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
the the amount of transmittance on the
 
01:09:38.150 --> 01:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
windshield but that may be coming up
 
01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:39.829 align:start position:0%
windshield but that may be coming up
later

01:09:39.829 --> 01:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
later
 
01:09:42.950 --> 01:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
but what we're dealing with is at what
 
01:09:45.490 --> 01:09:45.500 align:start position:0%
point Beyond those Federal Regulations
 
01:09:49.729 --> 01:09:49.739 align:start position:0%
should we also allow a
 
01:09:55.010 --> 01:09:55.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:58.550 --> 01:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
signed off on by the director for those
 
01:10:01.630 --> 01:10:01.640 align:start position:0%
people that have
 
01:10:05.150 --> 01:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
various illnesses sicknesses disease
 
01:10:07.250 --> 01:10:07.260 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to call it
 
01:10:11.930 --> 01:10:11.940 align:start position:0%
um that that need additional tinting
 
01:10:11.940 --> 01:10:12.590 align:start position:0%
um that that need additional tinting
um

01:10:12.590 --> 01:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:15.950 --> 01:10:15.960 align:start position:0%
so that's what I'm hopeful that this is
 
01:10:17.450 --> 01:10:17.460 align:start position:0%
going to give us
 
01:10:19.850 --> 01:10:19.860 align:start position:0%
does that seem right to you which one
 
01:10:22.010 --> 01:10:22.020 align:start position:0%
that are the paperwork you have from us
 
01:10:23.209 --> 01:10:23.219 align:start position:0%
will give you what you're looking for
 
01:10:26.149 --> 01:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
yes correct
 
01:10:28.189 --> 01:10:28.199 align:start position:0%
um so Maria is more familiar with the
 
01:10:30.070 --> 01:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
process she's actually the one that
 
01:10:32.630 --> 01:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
processes the waivers currently for DMV
 
01:10:35.990 --> 01:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
on these I think the confusion came so
 
01:10:37.970 --> 01:10:37.980 align:start position:0%
she has it laid out here that prior to
 
01:10:40.189 --> 01:10:40.199 align:start position:0%
the 2022 session
 
01:10:42.970 --> 01:10:42.980 align:start position:0%
we allowed that you could have the left
 
01:10:47.330 --> 01:10:47.340 align:start position:0%
the right and the windshield have not um
 
01:10:49.850 --> 01:10:49.860 align:start position:0%
less than 35 percent light
 
01:10:49.860 --> 01:10:51.470 align:start position:0%
less than 35 percent light
transmittance

01:10:51.470 --> 01:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
transmittance
 
01:10:54.649 --> 01:10:54.659 align:start position:0%
then there was a bill put through that
 
01:10:57.410 --> 01:10:57.420 align:start position:0%
changed it that it could be 70 of light
 
01:11:00.229 --> 01:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
transmission and the windshield was
 
01:11:02.149 --> 01:11:02.159 align:start position:0%
taking other the light the left and
 
01:11:04.070 --> 01:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
right was taken out of that correct out
 
01:11:05.209 --> 01:11:05.219 align:start position:0%
of the waiver that's correct out of the
 
01:11:05.219 --> 01:11:06.350 align:start position:0%
of the waiver that's correct out of the
waiver

01:11:06.350 --> 01:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
waiver
 
01:11:10.070 --> 01:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
and and that was that 70 was the Federal
 
01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:12.709 align:start position:0%
and and that was that 70 was the Federal
limit

01:11:12.709 --> 01:11:12.719 align:start position:0%
limit
 
01:11:15.050 --> 01:11:15.060 align:start position:0%
how the windows are already manufactured
 
01:11:16.790 --> 01:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
that way right correct did the federal
 
01:11:20.510 --> 01:11:20.520 align:start position:0%
do the federal rules have
 
01:11:22.610 --> 01:11:22.620 align:start position:0%
um provision for
 
01:11:25.490 --> 01:11:25.500 align:start position:0%
um special exceptions I did not find one
 
01:11:28.490 --> 01:11:28.500 align:start position:0%
no okay so that's left up to the state
 
01:11:31.729 --> 01:11:31.739 align:start position:0%
then I gather to uh to be able to
 
01:11:35.590 --> 01:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
include any further beyond that Federal
 
01:11:39.169 --> 01:11:39.179 align:start position:0%
uh number if they want to have special
 
01:11:42.229 --> 01:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
uh correct when I in my research I could
 
01:11:44.630 --> 01:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
not find anything that gave um special
 
01:11:46.130 --> 01:11:46.140 align:start position:0%
dispensation to anyone with medical
 
01:11:48.770 --> 01:11:48.780 align:start position:0%
conditions under the federal law
 
01:11:51.470 --> 01:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
and the Federal Regulations
 
01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:52.669 align:start position:0%
and the Federal Regulations
um

01:11:52.669 --> 01:11:52.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:55.490 --> 01:11:55.500 align:start position:0%
are covering just to be clear covering
 
01:11:58.310 --> 01:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
both the windshield and the two windows
 
01:12:00.470 --> 01:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
on either side of the driver
 
01:12:03.470 --> 01:12:03.480 align:start position:0%
I believe so yes it's for and it cannot
 
01:12:06.470 --> 01:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
have less than 70 percent right and we
 
01:12:08.689 --> 01:12:08.699 align:start position:0%
did not include the windshield when we
 
01:12:10.250 --> 01:12:10.260 align:start position:0%
wrote that
 
01:12:12.830 --> 01:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
we only included just the two windows on
 
01:12:15.470 --> 01:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
either side correct well the the first
 
01:12:17.209 --> 01:12:17.219 align:start position:0%
there were two changes and the first
 
01:12:17.219 --> 01:12:18.229 align:start position:0%
there were two changes and the first
change

01:12:18.229 --> 01:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
um removed the side windows and had them
 
01:12:23.570 --> 01:12:23.580 align:start position:0%
no less than 70 percent but it remained
 
01:12:24.830 --> 01:12:24.840 align:start position:0%
that you could have a waiver for the
 
01:12:26.750 --> 01:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
windshield and it could be as dark as 35
 
01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
percent yes the second law changed
 
01:12:32.570 --> 01:12:32.580 align:start position:0%
changed that to 70 as well okay so our
 
01:12:35.750 --> 01:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
goal right now is to is to draft this so
 
01:12:40.970 --> 01:12:40.980 align:start position:0%
that we have 70 in in the windshield and
 
01:12:42.649 --> 01:12:42.659 align:start position:0%
the two windows on either side of the
 
01:12:42.659 --> 01:12:44.570 align:start position:0%
the two windows on either side of the
driver

01:12:44.570 --> 01:12:44.580 align:start position:0%
driver
 
01:12:48.830 --> 01:12:48.840 align:start position:0%
and we allow further Darkness if under
 
01:12:51.229 --> 01:12:51.239 align:start position:0%
special exception correct
 
01:12:54.050 --> 01:12:54.060 align:start position:0%
agreed and to bring that to it was 50 we
 
01:12:56.209 --> 01:12:56.219 align:start position:0%
were going to put that at
 
01:12:59.390 --> 01:12:59.400 align:start position:0%
it used to be 35 like transmittance and
 
01:13:02.270 --> 01:13:02.280 align:start position:0%
it has been historically concerning
 
01:13:05.390 --> 01:13:05.400 align:start position:0%
because the the 35 is very dark if you
 
01:13:07.189 --> 01:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
notice on the bottom it shows that the
 
01:13:09.229 --> 01:13:09.239 align:start position:0%
different Darkness so we thought the
 
01:13:11.270 --> 01:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
amount of complaints that come in
 
01:13:13.610 --> 01:13:13.620 align:start position:0%
um we thought that maybe 50 would be a
 
01:13:17.810 --> 01:13:17.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:17.820 --> 01:13:19.010 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:13:19.010 --> 01:13:19.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:21.350 --> 01:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
I'll let somebody else jump in here if
 
01:13:25.189 --> 01:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:25.199 --> 01:13:27.290 align:start position:0%
 
question

01:13:27.290 --> 01:13:27.300 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:13:27.300 --> 01:13:28.189 align:start position:0%
question
um

01:13:28.189 --> 01:13:28.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:30.950 --> 01:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
you held yours up and you had a dark
 
01:13:32.930 --> 01:13:32.940 align:start position:0%
spot on there is there something did you
 
01:13:35.050 --> 01:13:35.060 align:start position:0%
not was that something that was yeah
 
01:13:37.729 --> 01:13:37.739 align:start position:0%
you didn't get that may I bring it up to
 
01:13:41.390 --> 01:13:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:44.870 --> 01:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
okay and I did have one question on that
 
01:13:47.630 --> 01:13:47.640 align:start position:0%
do the federal standards
 
01:13:52.990 --> 01:13:53.000 align:start position:0%
uh and have a requirement for General
 
01:13:56.149 --> 01:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
application for new cars
 
01:13:59.030 --> 01:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
I I'm sorry I'm not aware of that
 
01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:03.130 align:start position:0%
I I'm sorry I'm not aware of that
okay

01:14:03.130 --> 01:14:03.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:07.130 --> 01:14:07.140 align:start position:0%
do you know what um just doing a quick
 
01:14:08.810 --> 01:14:08.820 align:start position:0%
search here it looks like
 
01:14:10.910 --> 01:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
um a lot of states are down in the like
 
01:14:13.430 --> 01:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
the a lot of them are in the 30s you
 
01:14:15.169 --> 01:14:15.179 align:start position:0%
know 70 seems to be pretty high is there
 
01:14:19.550 --> 01:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
a reason why we wanted to be I mean
 
01:14:21.530 --> 01:14:21.540 align:start position:0%
you know it looks like Massachusetts is
 
01:14:22.850 --> 01:14:22.860 align:start position:0%
down in the 30s if I'm reading this
 
01:14:22.860 --> 01:14:23.810 align:start position:0%
down in the 30s if I'm reading this
right

01:14:23.810 --> 01:14:23.820 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:14:25.610 --> 01:14:25.620 align:start position:0%
um it is there a reason why you wanted
 
01:14:29.030 --> 01:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
it higher up here or I mean it's or you
 
01:14:31.250 --> 01:14:31.260 align:start position:0%
didn't request it to be higher yeah so
 
01:14:34.010 --> 01:14:34.020 align:start position:0%
the higher percentage is actually the
 
01:14:34.020 --> 01:14:35.450 align:start position:0%
the higher percentage is actually the
more

01:14:35.450 --> 01:14:35.460 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:14:37.189 --> 01:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
um light transmittance that comes
 
01:14:38.930 --> 01:14:38.940 align:start position:0%
through so the lower the percentage is
 
01:14:41.030 --> 01:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
how is how dark so in Massachusetts you
 
01:14:44.030 --> 01:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
see they have blacked out windows so if
 
01:14:46.070 --> 01:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
they have the 35 that's where we're
 
01:14:48.890 --> 01:14:48.900 align:start position:0%
looking at with that which we used to
 
01:14:52.010 --> 01:14:52.020 align:start position:0%
allow the waiver to go that low yeah
 
01:14:54.649 --> 01:14:54.659 align:start position:0%
um and that's when that was changed to
 
01:14:58.310 --> 01:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
put it up to the 70 we're compromising
 
01:15:01.130 --> 01:15:01.140 align:start position:0%
in the middle and proposing a 50 which
 
01:15:03.530 --> 01:15:03.540 align:start position:0%
still gives someone that Darkness but
 
01:15:05.870 --> 01:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't block out their windshields okay
 
01:15:12.410 --> 01:15:12.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:15.709 --> 01:15:15.719 align:start position:0%
is this page in here one from your
 
01:15:15.719 --> 01:15:17.209 align:start position:0%
is this page in here one from your
department

01:15:17.209 --> 01:15:17.219 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:15:20.149 --> 01:15:20.159 align:start position:0%
because it says down to 35 was the
 
01:15:20.159 --> 01:15:23.990 align:start position:0%
because it says down to 35 was the
recommendation

01:15:23.990 --> 01:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:25.910 --> 01:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
I can't Mr chair
 
01:15:29.570 --> 01:15:29.580 align:start position:0%
um yes that was the copy I got from
 
01:15:32.810 --> 01:15:32.820 align:start position:0%
before we looked at the 35 and said 50
 
01:15:34.130 --> 01:15:34.140 align:start position:0%
is probably better
 
01:15:36.590 --> 01:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
so if you strike the 35 and put 50
 
01:15:38.810 --> 01:15:38.820 align:start position:0%
that's what the department is that's
 
01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
what the Department's recommending okay
 
01:15:42.350 --> 01:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:15:48.350 --> 01:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:50.149 --> 01:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
and that's only for people with medical
 
01:15:50.159 --> 01:15:51.830 align:start position:0%
and that's only for people with medical
waivers

01:15:51.830 --> 01:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
waivers
 
01:15:53.510 --> 01:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
that's correct Greg and there is
 
01:15:56.030 --> 01:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
currently administrative rules outlining
 
01:15:58.310 --> 01:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
outlining that okay and everybody else
 
01:16:00.169 --> 01:16:00.179 align:start position:0%
on the side windows wouldn't be able to
 
01:16:05.870 --> 01:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:08.330 --> 01:16:08.340 align:start position:0%
the original bill
 
01:16:11.030 --> 01:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
had a list of um
 
01:16:13.189 --> 01:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
of conditions
 
01:16:16.790 --> 01:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:19.970 --> 01:16:19.980 align:start position:0%
that actually was attached to
 
01:16:22.250 --> 01:16:22.260 align:start position:0%
a form
 
01:16:24.890 --> 01:16:24.900 align:start position:0%
a letter that would be required from the
 
01:16:27.649 --> 01:16:27.659 align:start position:0%
doctor primary care provider optometrist
 
01:16:31.390 --> 01:16:31.400 align:start position:0%
ophthalmologist and any other medical
 
01:16:34.310 --> 01:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
practitioner and they were and they had
 
01:16:36.790 --> 01:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
a list of specific
 
01:16:39.530 --> 01:16:39.540 align:start position:0%
diagnosis is
 
01:16:43.970 --> 01:16:43.980 align:start position:0%
known to be improved by window tinting
 
01:16:43.980 --> 01:16:45.110 align:start position:0%
known to be improved by window tinting
um

01:16:45.110 --> 01:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:48.950 --> 01:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
has anyone checked to your knowledge
 
01:16:54.350 --> 01:16:54.360 align:start position:0%
to know whether that that 35 or 50 is
 
01:16:56.810 --> 01:16:56.820 align:start position:0%
your preferred wood
 
01:17:00.830 --> 01:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
satisfy those conditions
 
01:17:03.649 --> 01:17:03.659 align:start position:0%
currently the administrative rules have
 
01:17:05.270 --> 01:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
a little bit different than the wording
 
01:17:06.350 --> 01:17:06.360 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:17:09.649 --> 01:17:09.659 align:start position:0%
in the uh in the um the legislation So
 
01:17:11.330 --> 01:17:11.340 align:start position:0%
currently the medical conditions under
 
01:17:13.010 --> 01:17:13.020 align:start position:0%
the administrative rules are in extreme
 
01:17:15.410 --> 01:17:15.420 align:start position:0%
intolerance to light allergic reactions
 
01:17:18.169 --> 01:17:18.179 align:start position:0%
to the sun melanoma and lupus
 
01:17:18.179 --> 01:17:19.270 align:start position:0%
to the sun melanoma and lupus
um

01:17:19.270 --> 01:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:21.530 --> 01:17:21.540 align:start position:0%
perforia and any other medical condition
 
01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
which is aggravated by exposure to the
 
01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:24.830 align:start position:0%
which is aggravated by exposure to the
sun

01:17:24.830 --> 01:17:24.840 align:start position:0%
sun
 
01:17:27.169 --> 01:17:27.179 align:start position:0%
um we we have not spoken to any medical
 
01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
condition any medical personnel to see
 
01:17:30.530 --> 01:17:30.540 align:start position:0%
if that's
 
01:17:32.450 --> 01:17:32.460 align:start position:0%
if that with a percentage would actually
 
01:17:32.460 --> 01:17:35.030 align:start position:0%
if that with a percentage would actually
alleviate

01:17:35.030 --> 01:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
alleviate
 
01:17:37.130 --> 01:17:37.140 align:start position:0%
um yeah so that's that would be my
 
01:17:37.140 --> 01:17:38.149 align:start position:0%
um yeah so that's that would be my
concern

01:17:38.149 --> 01:17:38.159 align:start position:0%
concern
 
01:17:39.830 --> 01:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
um if the
 
01:17:42.890 --> 01:17:42.900 align:start position:0%
if we're we're just arbitrarily because
 
01:17:44.450 --> 01:17:44.460 align:start position:0%
we don't like
 
01:17:47.450 --> 01:17:47.460 align:start position:0%
how this looks on this piece of paper
 
01:17:51.590 --> 01:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
um going from 35 to 50 and then we find
 
01:17:54.050 --> 01:17:54.060 align:start position:0%
that someone with lupus it doesn't do us
 
01:17:57.950 --> 01:17:57.960 align:start position:0%
any good to go you know less
 
01:18:01.010 --> 01:18:01.020 align:start position:0%
less dark than 35 percent that would be
 
01:18:02.510 --> 01:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
my concern
 
01:18:04.430 --> 01:18:04.440 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if that's the case I'm
 
01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:05.630 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if that's the case I'm
just

01:18:05.630 --> 01:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:18:08.570 --> 01:18:08.580 align:start position:0%
um I think I would want to know if
 
01:18:08.580 --> 01:18:09.850 align:start position:0%
um I think I would want to know if
somebody

01:18:09.850 --> 01:18:09.860 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
01:18:12.590 --> 01:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
could check that with
 
01:18:14.870 --> 01:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
with for any of the illnesses that are
 
01:18:18.110 --> 01:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned in either rules or on the on
 
01:18:20.930 --> 01:18:20.940 align:start position:0%
the bill does that make sense see what
 
01:18:22.729 --> 01:18:22.739 align:start position:0%
like a doctor might say would be an
 
01:18:26.689 --> 01:18:26.699 align:start position:0%
acceptable level or yeah I mean if
 
01:18:29.930 --> 01:18:29.940 align:start position:0%
if we're just changing it to 50 and they
 
01:18:33.290 --> 01:18:33.300 align:start position:0%
say well then that renders this special
 
01:18:33.300 --> 01:18:34.390 align:start position:0%
say well then that renders this special
permit

01:18:34.390 --> 01:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
permit
 
01:18:37.850 --> 01:18:37.860 align:start position:0%
mood because we really need 35 for
 
01:18:41.030 --> 01:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
someone with this condition then what
 
01:18:43.669 --> 01:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
have we done yeah so the other question
 
01:18:46.490 --> 01:18:46.500 align:start position:0%
is did somebody just grab a list of
 
01:18:48.649 --> 01:18:48.659 align:start position:0%
things that affect the eyes
 
01:18:49.970 --> 01:18:49.980 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
01:18:51.830 --> 01:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
I don't know without any further
 
01:18:54.530 --> 01:18:54.540 align:start position:0%
research on but why do the work if we
 
01:18:56.209 --> 01:18:56.219 align:start position:0%
don't know that it's actually going to
 
01:18:57.410 --> 01:18:57.420 align:start position:0%
do this
 
01:18:57.420 --> 01:18:58.970 align:start position:0%
do this
um

01:18:58.970 --> 01:18:58.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:01.669 --> 01:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
so that I guess we can we can still
 
01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
we'll leave open the question of of the
 
01:19:08.810 --> 01:19:08.820 align:start position:0%
35 to 50 change here but as far as the
 
01:19:11.270 --> 01:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
rest of it I still have
 
01:19:14.330 --> 01:19:14.340 align:start position:0%
other questions about the actual
 
01:19:17.750 --> 01:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
process of the special permit
 
01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:19.130 align:start position:0%
process of the special permit
um

01:19:19.130 --> 01:19:19.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
it still shows in here that it would not
 
01:19:24.070 --> 01:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
exceed four years
 
01:19:28.810 --> 01:19:28.820 align:start position:0%
for a quote lasting medical necessity
 
01:19:32.209 --> 01:19:32.219 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if there's what's if
 
01:19:33.890 --> 01:19:33.900 align:start position:0%
there's something magical about that
 
01:19:37.310 --> 01:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
that four-year time period and why it it
 
01:19:39.890 --> 01:19:39.900 align:start position:0%
couldn't be something like for the life
 
01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
of that or for the the length of time
 
01:19:45.649 --> 01:19:45.659 align:start position:0%
that someone owns that car or something
 
01:19:47.330 --> 01:19:47.340 align:start position:0%
like that
 
01:19:49.370 --> 01:19:49.380 align:start position:0%
currently the um the current law
 
01:19:52.430 --> 01:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
actually is for two years right and we
 
01:19:53.630 --> 01:19:53.640 align:start position:0%
really don't have any kind of
 
01:19:55.370 --> 01:19:55.380 align:start position:0%
recommendation for that that's totally
 
01:19:57.350 --> 01:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
up to um this is a legislative change
 
01:20:00.590 --> 01:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
but we would support anything I do know
 
01:20:03.169 --> 01:20:03.179 align:start position:0%
that there are
 
01:20:04.970 --> 01:20:04.980 align:start position:0%
um very similar to like the walking
 
01:20:06.830 --> 01:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
disability placards which are good for
 
01:20:08.870 --> 01:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
five years and I know this concern
 
01:20:11.750 --> 01:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
whether the person changes vehicles on
 
01:20:12.890 --> 01:20:12.900 align:start position:0%
this you know I mean they're supposed to
 
01:20:15.169 --> 01:20:15.179 align:start position:0%
let us know but if someone else is using
 
01:20:16.430 --> 01:20:16.440 align:start position:0%
the vehicle or it's registered to
 
01:20:18.050 --> 01:20:18.060 align:start position:0%
someone else they could continue using
 
01:20:19.790 --> 01:20:19.800 align:start position:0%
it so I think we'll see that and and
 
01:20:22.189 --> 01:20:22.199 align:start position:0%
that brings up another problem here
 
01:20:24.890 --> 01:20:24.900 align:start position:0%
um this this
 
01:20:24.900 --> 01:20:25.610 align:start position:0%
um this this
um

01:20:25.610 --> 01:20:25.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:29.689 --> 01:20:29.699 align:start position:0%
waiver this special permit is for the
 
01:20:33.770 --> 01:20:33.780 align:start position:0%
person not for the car correct the yes
 
01:20:36.169 --> 01:20:36.179 align:start position:0%
it's well the um on the application it
 
01:20:37.850 --> 01:20:37.860 align:start position:0%
is for the the patient the person who
 
01:20:39.530 --> 01:20:39.540 align:start position:0%
has medical condition and they are to
 
01:20:41.510 --> 01:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
list what vehicles that they have and
 
01:20:42.649 --> 01:20:42.659 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to give us the copy of
 
01:20:45.229 --> 01:20:45.239 align:start position:0%
their registration if they change
 
01:20:47.330 --> 01:20:47.340 align:start position:0%
Vehicles they then let us know and we
 
01:20:48.890 --> 01:20:48.900 align:start position:0%
will provide them a new waiver for that
 
01:20:51.709 --> 01:20:51.719 align:start position:0%
vehicle okay
 
01:20:54.709 --> 01:20:54.719 align:start position:0%
but if someone is there a Prohibition
 
01:20:58.070 --> 01:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
anywhere that allows someone else to be
 
01:20:59.930 --> 01:20:59.940 align:start position:0%
driving that vehicle
 
01:21:02.450 --> 01:21:02.460 align:start position:0%
the administrative rules are silent on
 
01:21:04.490 --> 01:21:04.500 align:start position:0%
that they just say that the vehicle it
 
01:21:05.870 --> 01:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't even have to be owned by them
 
01:21:08.930 --> 01:21:08.940 align:start position:0%
it's a vehicle that they they drive that
 
01:21:11.209 --> 01:21:11.219 align:start position:0%
they drive so they're
 
01:21:15.950 --> 01:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:17.870 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:21:17.870 --> 01:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:20.930 --> 01:21:20.940 align:start position:0%
yeah so so this could be for a person
 
01:21:23.990 --> 01:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
who only rides and doesn't drive
 
01:21:26.030 --> 01:21:26.040 align:start position:0%
we have some that are for minors just so
 
01:21:27.950 --> 01:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
you know some of these come through that
 
01:21:31.550 --> 01:21:31.560 align:start position:0%
a minor child has a condition and so the
 
01:21:33.649 --> 01:21:33.659 align:start position:0%
the vehicle is registered by the to the
 
01:21:35.450 --> 01:21:35.460 align:start position:0%
parents okay so in that case the driver
 
01:21:38.030 --> 01:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
would have to be able to use that same
 
01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:39.169 align:start position:0%
would have to be able to use that same
vehicle

01:21:39.169 --> 01:21:39.179 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
01:21:42.350 --> 01:21:42.360 align:start position:0%
I understand but the waiver is coming
 
01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
through with the child's name on it yes
 
01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:48.350 align:start position:0%
through with the child's name on it yes
yeah

01:21:48.350 --> 01:21:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:50.930 --> 01:21:50.940 align:start position:0%
so the question in years past the
 
01:21:53.390 --> 01:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
question would be
 
01:21:56.390 --> 01:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
is is it legal for that
 
01:21:58.550 --> 01:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
for the parent to be driving when the
 
01:22:03.729 --> 01:22:03.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:06.050 --> 01:22:06.060 align:start position:0%
we do very similar for the walking
 
01:22:08.510 --> 01:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
disability as well if your child has a
 
01:22:10.610 --> 01:22:10.620 align:start position:0%
walking disability
 
01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
um you get a placard to use when you're
 
01:22:16.729 --> 01:22:16.739 align:start position:0%
driving that child
 
01:22:16.739 --> 01:22:19.910 align:start position:0%
driving that child
foreign

01:22:19.910 --> 01:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:21.530 --> 01:22:21.540 align:start position:0%
but that's
 
01:22:26.209 --> 01:22:26.219 align:start position:0%
doesn't affect the driver of the vehicle
 
01:22:28.450 --> 01:22:28.460 align:start position:0%
the same way that this does because
 
01:22:31.610 --> 01:22:31.620 align:start position:0%
you're not reducing the amount of light
 
01:22:34.130 --> 01:22:34.140 align:start position:0%
coming into the car that allows the
 
01:22:36.709 --> 01:22:36.719 align:start position:0%
driver to see in the case of a person
 
01:22:38.530 --> 01:22:38.540 align:start position:0%
with a walking disability
 
01:22:41.270 --> 01:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
uh no change to the cars needed other
 
01:22:43.130 --> 01:22:43.140 align:start position:0%
than having the placard so they can park
 
01:22:45.050 --> 01:22:45.060 align:start position:0%
in a convenient parking space
 
01:22:47.209 --> 01:22:47.219 align:start position:0%
correct and the they can get the plates
 
01:22:53.450 --> 01:22:53.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:56.689 --> 01:22:56.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:56.699 --> 01:22:57.350 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:22:57.350 --> 01:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:00.229 --> 01:23:00.239 align:start position:0%
representative Coker
 
01:23:02.630 --> 01:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
I mean for what they're asking for right
 
01:23:05.450 --> 01:23:05.460 align:start position:0%
now I yeah the problem is it gets so
 
01:23:07.910 --> 01:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
complex to actually the administrative
 
01:23:10.070 --> 01:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
rules you know and enforcing it it's I
 
01:23:12.530 --> 01:23:12.540 align:start position:0%
mean because you got passengers it just
 
01:23:16.430 --> 01:23:16.440 align:start position:0%
gets so complex to I mean if people are
 
01:23:18.050 --> 01:23:18.060 align:start position:0%
that motivated to bring their tenting
 
01:23:20.510 --> 01:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
down to 50 you know if that's the number
 
01:23:24.350 --> 01:23:24.360 align:start position:0%
we settle on it's kind of you know it is
 
01:23:26.870 --> 01:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
what it is I don't see a huge um
 
01:23:29.689 --> 01:23:29.699 align:start position:0%
I don't have a giant issue with it I
 
01:23:32.270 --> 01:23:32.280 align:start position:0%
don't think the complexity is adding
 
01:23:34.250 --> 01:23:34.260 align:start position:0%
more complexity to the rules is going to
 
01:23:37.070 --> 01:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
really solve much yep if that makes
 
01:23:39.770 --> 01:23:39.780 align:start position:0%
sense so keep in mind right now we're at
 
01:23:41.930 --> 01:23:41.940 align:start position:0%
70. the law that we're under right now
 
01:23:44.990 --> 01:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
only allows them 70 yeah so the 50s
 
01:23:46.490 --> 01:23:46.500 align:start position:0%
allowing them to go darker than what
 
01:23:50.390 --> 01:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:52.729 --> 01:23:52.739 align:start position:0%
um the other part that has always been a
 
01:23:55.729 --> 01:23:55.739 align:start position:0%
somewhat of a obstacle that I've heard
 
01:24:00.350 --> 01:24:00.360 align:start position:0%
complaints about is is the fact that
 
01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:01.550 align:start position:0%
complaints about is is the fact that
um

01:24:01.550 --> 01:24:01.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:03.770 --> 01:24:03.780 align:start position:0%
the only way that
 
01:24:07.430 --> 01:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
that either the off that the officer
 
01:24:10.250 --> 01:24:10.260 align:start position:0%
would know that there is a special
 
01:24:13.090 --> 01:24:13.100 align:start position:0%
permit for that darkness
 
01:24:16.970 --> 01:24:16.980 align:start position:0%
is if they pull the person over and then
 
01:24:20.630 --> 01:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
ask for a copy of the of the permit
 
01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:21.709 align:start position:0%
ask for a copy of the of the permit
um

01:24:21.709 --> 01:24:21.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:24.649 --> 01:24:24.659 align:start position:0%
has it ever been discussed or is it does
 
01:24:26.870 --> 01:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
it work in any other states that you're
 
01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:27.970 align:start position:0%
it work in any other states that you're
aware

01:24:27.970 --> 01:24:27.980 align:start position:0%
aware
 
01:24:32.209 --> 01:24:32.219 align:start position:0%
so that the officer would be able to
 
01:24:32.219 --> 01:24:33.350 align:start position:0%
so that the officer would be able to
know

01:24:33.350 --> 01:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:24:36.530 --> 01:24:36.540 align:start position:0%
that this this is a
 
01:24:39.709 --> 01:24:39.719 align:start position:0%
is a special permitted vehicle and and
 
01:24:42.110 --> 01:24:42.120 align:start position:0%
would have a
 
01:24:44.390 --> 01:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
um a reason not to stop them at that
 
01:24:47.149 --> 01:24:47.159 align:start position:0%
point I am not aware of that
 
01:24:50.290 --> 01:24:50.300 align:start position:0%
um it's Troop G trip Jesus
 
01:24:53.990 --> 01:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
we have discussed in the past could you
 
01:25:00.470 --> 01:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:02.630 --> 01:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
sorry no you're good
 
01:25:05.510 --> 01:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
um so they're they're not so to my uh
 
01:25:07.910 --> 01:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
familiarity however we have discussed in
 
01:25:10.550 --> 01:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
the past given the fraudulent use of
 
01:25:12.890 --> 01:25:12.900 align:start position:0%
window tint waivers uh the ability to be
 
01:25:14.330 --> 01:25:14.340 align:start position:0%
able to put something on a driver's
 
01:25:16.010 --> 01:25:16.020 align:start position:0%
license that uh potentially would be
 
01:25:17.750 --> 01:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
able to notify us that you know when you
 
01:25:19.370 --> 01:25:19.380 align:start position:0%
look at the driver's license but to your
 
01:25:21.290 --> 01:25:21.300 align:start position:0%
point you know we would have to stop the
 
01:25:23.270 --> 01:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
individual to be able to to look at that
 
01:25:25.850 --> 01:25:25.860 align:start position:0%
so that is something we could look at as
 
01:25:27.590 --> 01:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
far as registration is concerned so that
 
01:25:28.850 --> 01:25:28.860 align:start position:0%
when we were to run a vehicle
 
01:25:31.010 --> 01:25:31.020 align:start position:0%
registration maybe there's a notation in
 
01:25:32.390 --> 01:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
there that allows us to know that a
 
01:25:36.229 --> 01:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
waiver is on file could be uh again that
 
01:25:37.490 --> 01:25:37.500 align:start position:0%
would only
 
01:25:40.130 --> 01:25:40.140 align:start position:0%
that would only show on the Regis on the
 
01:25:42.350 --> 01:25:42.360 align:start position:0%
on the license you're talking the
 
01:25:44.090 --> 01:25:44.100 align:start position:0%
license or the registration the
 
01:25:45.470 --> 01:25:45.480 align:start position:0%
registration of the vehicle so if we
 
01:25:47.270 --> 01:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
were to see the vehicle run the license
 
01:25:48.950 --> 01:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
plate on the vehicle because we see the
 
01:25:50.630 --> 01:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
the violation that we believe exists
 
01:25:52.669 --> 01:25:52.679 align:start position:0%
when the registration populates we would
 
01:25:54.350 --> 01:25:54.360 align:start position:0%
we would see that that person has a
 
01:25:56.510 --> 01:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
window tint waiver
 
01:25:58.490 --> 01:25:58.500 align:start position:0%
but it would have to be the owner that
 
01:25:59.990 --> 01:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
has the
 
01:26:02.870 --> 01:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
that has the waiver not
 
01:26:05.450 --> 01:26:05.460 align:start position:0%
in case of the child for instance How
 
01:26:05.460 --> 01:26:06.169 align:start position:0%
in case of the child for instance How
would

01:26:06.169 --> 01:26:06.179 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:26:07.790 --> 01:26:07.800 align:start position:0%
that would get really complicated
 
01:26:08.990 --> 01:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it
 
01:26:12.050 --> 01:26:12.060 align:start position:0%
um no in the case that she provided the
 
01:26:13.729 --> 01:26:13.739 align:start position:0%
list of registrations for the registered
 
01:26:15.950 --> 01:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
owner would be covered under that that
 
01:26:18.290 --> 01:26:18.300 align:start position:0%
waiver so even though when you sign that
 
01:26:20.090 --> 01:26:20.100 align:start position:0%
minor is driving the car but the
 
01:26:22.010 --> 01:26:22.020 align:start position:0%
registration the waiver is attached to
 
01:26:24.410 --> 01:26:24.420 align:start position:0%
that registration so we could still uh
 
01:26:25.669 --> 01:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
you know get that information through
 
01:26:27.649 --> 01:26:27.659 align:start position:0%
the registration so in that way it would
 
01:26:31.129 --> 01:26:31.139 align:start position:0%
almost cover the car rather than the
 
01:26:33.830 --> 01:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
individual great
 
01:26:36.470 --> 01:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
is there is is window tint a secondary
 
01:26:38.629 --> 01:26:38.639 align:start position:0%
or is that a primary like it's primary
 
01:26:39.830 --> 01:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
primary so you could pull somebody over
 
01:26:41.270 --> 01:26:41.280 align:start position:0%
for us okay
 
01:26:45.050 --> 01:26:45.060 align:start position:0%
oh is there any safety like are you
 
01:26:46.669 --> 01:26:46.679 align:start position:0%
aware of any safety studies that show
 
01:26:48.709 --> 01:26:48.719 align:start position:0%
like I mean the the Dark of the tent the
 
01:26:50.270 --> 01:26:50.280 align:start position:0%
more I mean is there any kind of
 
01:26:53.750 --> 01:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
correlation that so I'm not aware of any
 
01:26:56.149 --> 01:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
safety studies however excuse me I'm
 
01:26:56.159 --> 01:26:57.050 align:start position:0%
safety studies however excuse me I'm
sorry

01:26:57.050 --> 01:26:57.060 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
01:26:58.910 --> 01:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
um you know as law enforcement we
 
01:27:01.250 --> 01:27:01.260 align:start position:0%
obviously have a serious concern safety
 
01:27:02.810 --> 01:27:02.820 align:start position:0%
concerns not knowing uh being able to
 
01:27:04.790 --> 01:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
see in the vehicle and historically that
 
01:27:07.430 --> 01:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
has been you know our um our concerns
 
01:27:09.410 --> 01:27:09.420 align:start position:0%
with allowing for the window tint
 
01:27:11.930 --> 01:27:11.940 align:start position:0%
there's also concerns when people drive
 
01:27:14.209 --> 01:27:14.219 align:start position:0%
at night that you know given the
 
01:27:16.070 --> 01:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
darkness of the window tint it does
 
01:27:17.750 --> 01:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
affect their ability to be able to see
 
01:27:20.330 --> 01:27:20.340 align:start position:0%
so uh but be able to provide you with
 
01:27:21.950 --> 01:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
like a safety stuff or something I just
 
01:27:23.450 --> 01:27:23.460 align:start position:0%
I'm not familiar with any off the top of
 
01:27:25.910 --> 01:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
my head is is 50 pretty hard I mean I
 
01:27:27.890 --> 01:27:27.900 align:start position:0%
just I don't know is that pretty hard
 
01:27:30.830 --> 01:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
for you guys to see through as I mean
 
01:27:34.070 --> 01:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
so 50 actually would probably it you
 
01:27:35.510 --> 01:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
know and Marie and I did discuss this
 
01:27:37.310 --> 01:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
when when uh the presentation was made
 
01:27:40.669 --> 01:27:40.679 align:start position:0%
50 I think would be uh would allow us to
 
01:27:41.689 --> 01:27:41.699 align:start position:0%
be able to see in the vehicle a lot
 
01:27:45.070 --> 01:27:45.080 align:start position:0%
better okay um the 35 is
 
01:27:47.810 --> 01:27:47.820 align:start position:0%
docked to the point where
 
01:27:48.890 --> 01:27:48.900 align:start position:0%
um I wouldn't be able to make out
 
01:27:50.870 --> 01:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
anything discernible in the vehicle that
 
01:27:52.189 --> 01:27:52.199 align:start position:0%
I could maybe see that there's a shadow
 
01:27:53.750 --> 01:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
of a person inside of it yeah I wouldn't
 
01:27:54.590 --> 01:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
be able to see what they were doing
 
01:27:57.229 --> 01:27:57.239 align:start position:0%
whereas at the 50 level where where it
 
01:27:59.209 --> 01:27:59.219 align:start position:0%
was mentioned before we're at 70 now so
 
01:28:01.910 --> 01:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
50 is uh is something that would give us
 
01:28:04.310 --> 01:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
the ability to be able to see I think
 
01:28:06.410 --> 01:28:06.420 align:start position:0%
more clearly in the vehicle and identify
 
01:28:08.510 --> 01:28:08.520 align:start position:0%
anything that needs to be addressed so
 
01:28:11.570 --> 01:28:11.580 align:start position:0%
good thank you are you are you at all
 
01:28:14.209 --> 01:28:14.219 align:start position:0%
familiar with the uh the diagnosis that
 
01:28:16.010 --> 01:28:16.020 align:start position:0%
that are
 
01:28:19.729 --> 01:28:19.739 align:start position:0%
out caused this special waiver yeah I I
 
01:28:21.470 --> 01:28:21.480 align:start position:0%
was going to be a doctor before I became
 
01:28:22.629 --> 01:28:22.639 align:start position:0%
a trooper
 
01:28:25.310 --> 01:28:25.320 align:start position:0%
I'm just joking with you um I am not
 
01:28:27.169 --> 01:28:27.179 align:start position:0%
familiar with with each one of the
 
01:28:29.689 --> 01:28:29.699 align:start position:0%
illnesses I do know that you know in the
 
01:28:30.530 --> 01:28:30.540 align:start position:0%
state of Massachusetts because
 
01:28:31.910 --> 01:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts happened to come up
 
01:28:34.010 --> 01:28:34.020 align:start position:0%
earlier you know they they categorized
 
01:28:36.050 --> 01:28:36.060 align:start position:0%
their waivers just under photosensitive
 
01:28:39.770 --> 01:28:39.780 align:start position:0%
uh or you know uh it's it's sensitivity
 
01:28:41.930 --> 01:28:41.940 align:start position:0%
to light essentially so I think that
 
01:28:43.490 --> 01:28:43.500 align:start position:0%
with our administrative rules we do
 
01:28:45.350 --> 01:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
allow for other conditions that states
 
01:28:47.750 --> 01:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
don't but I'm not familiar with what
 
01:28:50.030 --> 01:28:50.040 align:start position:0%
each one of those uh conditions you know
 
01:28:52.370 --> 01:28:52.380 align:start position:0%
pose for symptoms and what would work
 
01:28:55.750 --> 01:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
best as far as the level of Darkness my
 
01:28:58.430 --> 01:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
this may be off the subject I don't know
 
01:29:02.270 --> 01:29:02.280 align:start position:0%
but but it seems to me that um
 
01:29:05.930 --> 01:29:05.940 align:start position:0%
the people that have these diagnoses are
 
01:29:10.550 --> 01:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
are not in the car 24 7. so they must be
 
01:29:12.590 --> 01:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
doing something when they're not in the
 
01:29:15.530 --> 01:29:15.540 align:start position:0%
vehicle and I I just wondered why they
 
01:29:17.930 --> 01:29:17.940 align:start position:0%
aren't able to use whatever they use
 
01:29:19.750 --> 01:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
when they're walking down the sidewalk
 
01:29:22.250 --> 01:29:22.260 align:start position:0%
while they're driving
 
01:29:25.490 --> 01:29:25.500 align:start position:0%
um and is and would that
 
01:29:25.500 --> 01:29:27.590 align:start position:0%
um and is and would that
change

01:29:27.590 --> 01:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:29:30.110 --> 01:29:30.120 align:start position:0%
um that that number you know I mean what
 
01:29:33.470 --> 01:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
if you're if you're wearing special
 
01:29:36.530 --> 01:29:36.540 align:start position:0%
glasses when you're on the sidewalk
 
01:29:38.209 --> 01:29:38.219 align:start position:0%
um can you not
 
01:29:40.010 --> 01:29:40.020 align:start position:0%
use those when you're driving the
 
01:29:43.310 --> 01:29:43.320 align:start position:0%
vehicle as well and I'll also say
 
01:29:46.550 --> 01:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
the older I get it seems like the
 
01:29:49.310 --> 01:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
headlights coming back at me from the
 
01:29:51.169 --> 01:29:51.179 align:start position:0%
through the windshield are getting
 
01:29:53.390 --> 01:29:53.400 align:start position:0%
harder and harder to determine whether
 
01:29:55.790 --> 01:29:55.800 align:start position:0%
those are high beams coming at me or low
 
01:29:57.649 --> 01:29:57.659 align:start position:0%
beams coming so you'll be very happy to
 
01:29:58.669 --> 01:29:58.679 align:start position:0%
know that we've proposed some
 
01:30:00.169 --> 01:30:00.179 align:start position:0%
legislation this session that's going to
 
01:30:02.810 --> 01:30:02.820 align:start position:0%
address just that very topic does it
 
01:30:05.870 --> 01:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
involve a taser on the yeah we'll see
 
01:30:07.669 --> 01:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
how it goes
 
01:30:09.709 --> 01:30:09.719 align:start position:0%
um to your point sir regarding
 
01:30:11.330 --> 01:30:11.340 align:start position:0%
um outside of the vehicle the
 
01:30:12.890 --> 01:30:12.900 align:start position:0%
administrative rule set at DMV does
 
01:30:15.590 --> 01:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
address that the doctor has to notify a
 
01:30:18.410 --> 01:30:18.420 align:start position:0%
DMV that sunglasses are certified that
 
01:30:19.850 --> 01:30:19.860 align:start position:0%
sunglasses are other protective
 
01:30:21.410 --> 01:30:21.420 align:start position:0%
equipment will not alleviate the medical
 
01:30:23.870 --> 01:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
condition so if it's a condition that
 
01:30:26.990 --> 01:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
can be you know remedied by just wearing
 
01:30:29.750 --> 01:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
sunglasses then they don't qualify for a
 
01:30:31.430 --> 01:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
window tint waiver
 
01:30:33.649 --> 01:30:33.659 align:start position:0%
so it could be a skin condition or
 
01:30:36.290 --> 01:30:36.300 align:start position:0%
something along those lines that would
 
01:30:38.689 --> 01:30:38.699 align:start position:0%
you know make them need that that window
 
01:30:41.330 --> 01:30:41.340 align:start position:0%
tint but if if the doctor certifies that
 
01:30:43.790 --> 01:30:43.800 align:start position:0%
they can use sunglasses to alleviate the
 
01:30:45.229 --> 01:30:45.239 align:start position:0%
issue then they're not eligible for a
 
01:30:46.729 --> 01:30:46.739 align:start position:0%
window tint waiver currently under the
 
01:30:48.770 --> 01:30:48.780 align:start position:0%
administrative rules
 
01:30:51.770 --> 01:30:51.780 align:start position:0%
okay and and I guess it is
 
01:30:53.510 --> 01:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
there could be a complication if
 
01:30:57.229 --> 01:30:57.239 align:start position:0%
somebody has prescription uh glasses
 
01:30:59.149 --> 01:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
that reduce the amount of light
 
01:31:01.910 --> 01:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
whether you call them sunglasses or
 
01:31:04.550 --> 01:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
or otherwise and then they get in the
 
01:31:06.050 --> 01:31:06.060 align:start position:0%
car and drive it
 
01:31:08.090 --> 01:31:08.100 align:start position:0%
then they're doubly reducing the light
 
01:31:10.550 --> 01:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
if they have a extra tinting on the
 
01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:12.950 align:start position:0%
if they have a extra tinting on the
windows

01:31:12.950 --> 01:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
windows
 
01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:15.110 align:start position:0%
windows
okay

01:31:15.110 --> 01:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:31:17.450 --> 01:31:17.460 align:start position:0%
I mean I I just think you're kind of at
 
01:31:20.570 --> 01:31:20.580 align:start position:0%
this point it's like one how how much
 
01:31:22.610 --> 01:31:22.620 align:start position:0%
light do people with these conditions
 
01:31:24.229 --> 01:31:24.239 align:start position:0%
actually need blocked that's kind of
 
01:31:26.390 --> 01:31:26.400 align:start position:0%
what I'm curious like how low do they
 
01:31:30.350 --> 01:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
want to go and two if it's acceptable at
 
01:31:32.270 --> 01:31:32.280 align:start position:0%
a you know like on the other hand of
 
01:31:33.830 --> 01:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
that it's the safety issue like no
 
01:31:36.169 --> 01:31:36.179 align:start position:0%
matter you know you can't just black out
 
01:31:37.910 --> 01:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
your windows like I mean and drive
 
01:31:40.610 --> 01:31:40.620 align:start position:0%
around because it's not it's creates a
 
01:31:42.229 --> 01:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
safety issue for other people so we can
 
01:31:44.510 --> 01:31:44.520 align:start position:0%
if we can bring it down to a level
 
01:31:47.810 --> 01:31:47.820 align:start position:0%
that's relative you know 50 seems like a
 
01:31:50.030 --> 01:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
relatively safe number I mean at a
 
01:31:51.830 --> 01:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
certain point is it even smart to have
 
01:31:53.450 --> 01:31:53.460 align:start position:0%
the waiver and all that we just say hey
 
01:31:55.669 --> 01:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
side windows are 50 that covers enough
 
01:31:57.470 --> 01:31:57.480 align:start position:0%
in the medical conditions and well
 
01:31:59.810 --> 01:31:59.820 align:start position:0%
that's why it's up to the director yeah
 
01:32:02.629 --> 01:32:02.639 align:start position:0%
um when when the director receives the
 
01:32:04.729 --> 01:32:04.739 align:start position:0%
information and the application and the
 
01:32:06.649 --> 01:32:06.659 align:start position:0%
information from the doctor it would
 
01:32:08.390 --> 01:32:08.400 align:start position:0%
seem to me then it's up to the director
 
01:32:10.370 --> 01:32:10.380 align:start position:0%
to decide whether that's reasonable or
 
01:32:13.850 --> 01:32:13.860 align:start position:0%
not it's not you or I sitting in a in a
 
01:32:16.370 --> 01:32:16.380 align:start position:0%
room who does you know who doesn't have
 
01:32:18.050 --> 01:32:18.060 align:start position:0%
any of the information to come up with a
 
01:32:19.990 --> 01:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
number as far as I can see
 
01:32:23.510 --> 01:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
each individual waiver B patient
 
01:32:26.330 --> 01:32:26.340 align:start position:0%
specific well it is now yeah it is yeah
 
01:32:28.250 --> 01:32:28.260 align:start position:0%
okay right and to your point sir like
 
01:32:29.810 --> 01:32:29.820 align:start position:0%
you know we're looking at over a million
 
01:32:31.010 --> 01:32:31.020 align:start position:0%
and a half vehicles that are registered
 
01:32:32.209 --> 01:32:32.219 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire we're
 
01:32:34.370 --> 01:32:34.380 align:start position:0%
discussing about less than 500 window 10
 
01:32:36.590 --> 01:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
waivers right now a year so you know to
 
01:32:39.410 --> 01:32:39.420 align:start position:0%
just blanket say 50 for everybody that
 
01:32:41.270 --> 01:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
does increase our risk on law
 
01:32:42.830 --> 01:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement and other reasons uh like
 
01:32:44.270 --> 01:32:44.280 align:start position:0%
factors that we've talked about but
 
01:32:46.490 --> 01:32:46.500 align:start position:0%
again you know 500 people
 
01:32:49.189 --> 01:32:49.199 align:start position:0%
um it's it affects such a small group
 
01:32:51.530 --> 01:32:51.540 align:start position:0%
that the this type of application
 
01:32:54.709 --> 01:32:54.719 align:start position:0%
process I think is better served do you
 
01:32:57.229 --> 01:32:57.239 align:start position:0%
uh can you make comment about the not to
 
01:32:59.149 --> 01:32:59.159 align:start position:0%
exceed four years do you think it makes
 
01:33:03.229 --> 01:33:03.239 align:start position:0%
any difference whether uh if this is a a
 
01:33:06.229 --> 01:33:06.239 align:start position:0%
lasting medical necessity that it would
 
01:33:08.570 --> 01:33:08.580 align:start position:0%
if we did it for the life of the that
 
01:33:08.580 --> 01:33:10.129 align:start position:0%
if we did it for the life of the that
vehicle

01:33:10.129 --> 01:33:10.139 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
01:33:13.070 --> 01:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
um would that alleviate some of the
 
01:33:15.850 --> 01:33:15.860 align:start position:0%
the additional paperwork and and
 
01:33:18.050 --> 01:33:18.060 align:start position:0%
reapplying and
 
01:33:20.629 --> 01:33:20.639 align:start position:0%
um I I think to miss spockman's point
 
01:33:20.639 --> 01:33:21.890 align:start position:0%
um I I think to miss spockman's point
that

01:33:21.890 --> 01:33:21.900 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:33:24.470 --> 01:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
um unless required unless setting some
 
01:33:26.510 --> 01:33:26.520 align:start position:0%
sort of an expiration date on these
 
01:33:29.149 --> 01:33:29.159 align:start position:0%
types of waivers it's uh very difficult
 
01:33:31.189 --> 01:33:31.199 align:start position:0%
to be able to keep up on the vehic
 
01:33:33.290 --> 01:33:33.300 align:start position:0%
because of vehicles uh being you know
 
01:33:36.050 --> 01:33:36.060 align:start position:0%
purchased traded in it's very difficult
 
01:33:38.450 --> 01:33:38.460 align:start position:0%
to keep up with the registrations that
 
01:33:40.850 --> 01:33:40.860 align:start position:0%
are associated with each applicant so
 
01:33:43.490 --> 01:33:43.500 align:start position:0%
this this kind of forces you know that
 
01:33:43.500 --> 01:33:44.149 align:start position:0%
this this kind of forces you know that
um

01:33:44.149 --> 01:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:46.669 --> 01:33:46.679 align:start position:0%
that uh hey look at me on the spotlight
 
01:33:49.790 --> 01:33:49.800 align:start position:0%
this forces uh the applicant to you know
 
01:33:52.070 --> 01:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
essentially just make us aware again or
 
01:33:54.169 --> 01:33:54.179 align:start position:0%
the DMV aware every four years regarding
 
01:33:55.850 --> 01:33:55.860 align:start position:0%
those vehicles but if they did it every
 
01:33:58.430 --> 01:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
time that they changed a vehicle anyway
 
01:34:01.550 --> 01:34:01.560 align:start position:0%
yeah what's they're supposed to do
 
01:34:04.189 --> 01:34:04.199 align:start position:0%
right it doesn't always happen well it
 
01:34:06.590 --> 01:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
would have it would wouldn't the catch
 
01:34:10.310 --> 01:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:14.030 --> 01:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
um if if you are I mean when I had one
 
01:34:15.649 --> 01:34:15.659 align:start position:0%
of these waivers
 
01:34:17.209 --> 01:34:17.219 align:start position:0%
um the fellow that did the inspection
 
01:34:20.450 --> 01:34:20.460 align:start position:0%
would ask for the waiver right and and
 
01:34:23.870 --> 01:34:23.880 align:start position:0%
so if I changed vehicle
 
01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:24.709 align:start position:0%
so if I changed vehicle
um

01:34:24.709 --> 01:34:24.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:27.430 --> 01:34:27.440 align:start position:0%
and tried to have it done without
 
01:34:31.270 --> 01:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
notifying you folks then
 
01:34:34.430 --> 01:34:34.440 align:start position:0%
the inspection so it would seem to me
 
01:34:37.370 --> 01:34:37.380 align:start position:0%
for the life of the or the ownership of
 
01:34:40.010 --> 01:34:40.020 align:start position:0%
that vehicle would would be the
 
01:34:41.990 --> 01:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
the logical thing rather than an
 
01:34:44.450 --> 01:34:44.460 align:start position:0%
arbitrary four years I mean what
 
01:34:46.910 --> 01:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
so similar to like Miss Buckman had said
 
01:34:49.970 --> 01:34:49.980 align:start position:0%
regarding the handicap placard that we
 
01:34:51.770 --> 01:34:51.780 align:start position:0%
use or that is used it's five years
 
01:34:53.810 --> 01:34:53.820 align:start position:0%
right and again that's it's it allows
 
01:34:56.270 --> 01:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
the the DMV the doctors and the in the
 
01:34:58.910 --> 01:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
applicant to be reevaluated to ensure
 
01:35:01.129 --> 01:35:01.139 align:start position:0%
that the medical condition uh is still
 
01:35:03.649 --> 01:35:03.659 align:start position:0%
exists or or if there's any changes uh
 
01:35:05.930 --> 01:35:05.940 align:start position:0%
in that in that realm so but that's up
 
01:35:09.290 --> 01:35:09.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:11.030 --> 01:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
so in other words like once that once
 
01:35:13.189 --> 01:35:13.199 align:start position:0%
that waiver gets issued just just like a
 
01:35:15.830 --> 01:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
a disability placard you know once that
 
01:35:17.689 --> 01:35:17.699 align:start position:0%
plaque card gets issued
 
01:35:19.129 --> 01:35:19.139 align:start position:0%
um if we don't have a if there's no
 
01:35:20.870 --> 01:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
renewal process then there's nothing
 
01:35:23.990 --> 01:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
that prompts the the doctor then
 
01:35:25.850 --> 01:35:25.860 align:start position:0%
reevaluate the patient to determine that
 
01:35:27.169 --> 01:35:27.179 align:start position:0%
that's it's still necessary there it is
 
01:35:29.510 --> 01:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
cars aren't going to last forever I mean
 
01:35:32.330 --> 01:35:32.340 align:start position:0%
you know it I don't know it would seem I
 
01:35:33.950 --> 01:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
don't want to get argumentative here but
 
01:35:37.010 --> 01:35:37.020 align:start position:0%
it would seem to me that an arbitrary
 
01:35:38.930 --> 01:35:38.940 align:start position:0%
um two or four years
 
01:35:41.870 --> 01:35:41.880 align:start position:0%
makes more work for someone that
 
01:35:44.990 --> 01:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
obviously has a harder time doing things
 
01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:46.010 align:start position:0%
obviously has a harder time doing things
anyway

01:35:46.010 --> 01:35:46.020 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
01:35:48.290 --> 01:35:48.300 align:start position:0%
um made me need another doctor's
 
01:35:50.030 --> 01:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
appointment May need you know all of
 
01:35:51.350 --> 01:35:51.360 align:start position:0%
those kind of things to get the doctor
 
01:35:52.970 --> 01:35:52.980 align:start position:0%
to sign
 
01:35:56.330 --> 01:35:56.340 align:start position:0%
um it uh it just seems that if we if
 
01:35:58.850 --> 01:35:58.860 align:start position:0%
we're gearing this almost to the vehicle
 
01:35:58.860 --> 01:36:00.890 align:start position:0%
we're gearing this almost to the vehicle
anyway

01:36:00.890 --> 01:36:00.900 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
01:36:00.900 --> 01:36:02.090 align:start position:0%
anyway
um the

01:36:02.090 --> 01:36:02.100 align:start position:0%
um the
 
01:36:04.729 --> 01:36:04.739 align:start position:0%
the length of time that the the person
 
01:36:06.890 --> 01:36:06.900 align:start position:0%
owns that vehicle would be the logical
 
01:36:10.430 --> 01:36:10.440 align:start position:0%
place to make it is it just one one
 
01:36:11.629 --> 01:36:11.639 align:start position:0%
comment on that so the walking
 
01:36:13.430 --> 01:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
disability the reason that we do that as
 
01:36:16.370 --> 01:36:16.380 align:start position:0%
well is if the um owner of the vehicle
 
01:36:19.850 --> 01:36:19.860 align:start position:0%
passes away this also helps us certify
 
01:36:21.410 --> 01:36:21.420 align:start position:0%
that someone has Isn't renewing their
 
01:36:22.910 --> 01:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
registration because now like my town
 
01:36:25.910 --> 01:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
does online renewal if I pass away
 
01:36:27.950 --> 01:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
technically my husband could continue to
 
01:36:29.629 --> 01:36:29.639 align:start position:0%
register my vehicle that has a waiver
 
01:36:32.030 --> 01:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
and keep passing inspection if he brings
 
01:36:33.770 --> 01:36:33.780 align:start position:0%
it for an inspection so this is a way to
 
01:36:36.290 --> 01:36:36.300 align:start position:0%
certify as
 
01:36:38.209 --> 01:36:38.219 align:start position:0%
he stated that they saw the medical
 
01:36:40.250 --> 01:36:40.260 align:start position:0%
condition but also that the applicants
 
01:36:42.590 --> 01:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
still alive and someone's not using that
 
01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:43.970 align:start position:0%
still alive and someone's not using that
waiver

01:36:43.970 --> 01:36:43.980 align:start position:0%
waiver
 
01:36:48.169 --> 01:36:48.179 align:start position:0%
themselves we have seen it okay
 
01:36:50.330 --> 01:36:50.340 align:start position:0%
sir could I just just a point of
 
01:36:53.930 --> 01:36:53.940 align:start position:0%
clarification so is it your thought that
 
01:36:56.750 --> 01:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
the window 10 waiver would be by vehicle
 
01:36:58.129 --> 01:36:58.139 align:start position:0%
and then at the time in which the
 
01:37:00.410 --> 01:37:00.420 align:start position:0%
applicant obtains another vehicle they
 
01:37:02.030 --> 01:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
would then apply for another window tint
 
01:37:05.629 --> 01:37:05.639 align:start position:0%
waiver yes so if I were to keep my
 
01:37:07.729 --> 01:37:07.739 align:start position:0%
vehicle for every two years I trade in a
 
01:37:09.649 --> 01:37:09.659 align:start position:0%
lease well they're required to excuse me
 
01:37:11.990 --> 01:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
but they're required to now right I mean
 
01:37:14.110 --> 01:37:14.120 align:start position:0%
they're required when they have
 
01:37:17.390 --> 01:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
you're listing each of the the vehicles
 
01:37:20.510 --> 01:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
that that they drive or that they own or
 
01:37:23.270 --> 01:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
whatever that right it says and when
 
01:37:25.390 --> 01:37:25.400 align:start position:0%
they get a new one they're required to
 
01:37:28.850 --> 01:37:28.860 align:start position:0%
notify and have that put on
 
01:37:31.010 --> 01:37:31.020 align:start position:0%
my question is is it a notification or
 
01:37:34.070 --> 01:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
an application meaning if they get a new
 
01:37:34.910 --> 01:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
and just because I don't know the
 
01:37:36.410 --> 01:37:36.420 align:start position:0%
process so if they get a new vehicle do
 
01:37:37.729 --> 01:37:37.739 align:start position:0%
they have to give you a new application
 
01:37:39.410 --> 01:37:39.420 align:start position:0%
with a doctor signature or they just add
 
01:37:41.750 --> 01:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
that registration they just they turn in
 
01:37:43.550 --> 01:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
one they're allowed to have two vehicles
 
01:37:45.530 --> 01:37:45.540 align:start position:0%
registered for that so they would have
 
01:37:47.270 --> 01:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
to train one and just pop it with it
 
01:37:49.250 --> 01:37:49.260 align:start position:0%
okay so it's your thought then sir that
 
01:37:51.350 --> 01:37:51.360 align:start position:0%
they would swap that out yeah okay I'm
 
01:37:52.250 --> 01:37:52.260 align:start position:0%
with you
 
01:37:54.470 --> 01:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you that makes sense I think
 
01:37:54.480 --> 01:37:56.510 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you that makes sense I think
so

01:37:56.510 --> 01:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:37:56.520 --> 01:37:57.169 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:37:57.169 --> 01:37:57.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:59.629 --> 01:37:59.639 align:start position:0%
I don't think I have any I just wanted
 
01:38:01.250 --> 01:38:01.260 align:start position:0%
to make sure
 
01:38:03.350 --> 01:38:03.360 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:38:08.030 --> 01:38:08.040 align:start position:0%
we've only shown the one RSA 266 61.
 
01:38:11.030 --> 01:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
but this does show up on a on a bunch of
 
01:38:14.229 --> 01:38:14.239 align:start position:0%
other little RSA so anything that we do
 
01:38:17.930 --> 01:38:17.940 align:start position:0%
would need to eliminate and I'll give
 
01:38:21.169 --> 01:38:21.179 align:start position:0%
you an example there is uh there is a
 
01:38:24.550 --> 01:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:27.709 --> 01:38:27.719 align:start position:0%
265.95 for obstruction the driver's view
 
01:38:29.990 --> 01:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
or riding mechanism
 
01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:30.770 align:start position:0%
or riding mechanism
um

01:38:30.770 --> 01:38:30.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:35.149 --> 01:38:35.159 align:start position:0%
Roman 2 a the last line says no person
 
01:38:38.450 --> 01:38:38.460 align:start position:0%
shall Drive upon anyway in on
 
01:38:42.709 --> 01:38:42.719 align:start position:0%
show Drive upon any way any vehicle with
 
01:38:44.930 --> 01:38:44.940 align:start position:0%
aftermarket tinting on the windshield as
 
01:38:48.229 --> 01:38:48.239 align:start position:0%
proposed as prohibited under RSA 25.
 
01:38:50.390 --> 01:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
that that as far as I'm concerned can
 
01:39:04.189 --> 01:39:04.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:07.189 --> 01:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I understand yeah
 
01:39:08.870 --> 01:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
so what
 
01:39:10.669 --> 01:39:10.679 align:start position:0%
um we would we were adding the left and
 
01:39:13.689 --> 01:39:13.699 align:start position:0%
right of the driver back to that RSA the
 
01:39:17.209 --> 01:39:17.219 align:start position:0%
265.95 that would actually would add the
 
01:39:19.430 --> 01:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
because right now it says windshield
 
01:39:22.250 --> 01:39:22.260 align:start position:0%
on that I believe I'm looking at that uh
 
01:39:24.890 --> 01:39:24.900 align:start position:0%
this this line just says no person shall
 
01:39:28.189 --> 01:39:28.199 align:start position:0%
Drive upon any way any vehicle
 
01:39:31.370 --> 01:39:31.380 align:start position:0%
with aftermarket doesn't even make good
 
01:39:34.610 --> 01:39:34.620 align:start position:0%
grammatical sense but no person shall
 
01:39:36.229 --> 01:39:36.239 align:start position:0%
Drive upon any
 
01:39:39.290 --> 01:39:39.300 align:start position:0%
anyway any vehicle with aftermarket
 
01:39:41.570 --> 01:39:41.580 align:start position:0%
tinting on the windshield as prohibited
 
01:39:44.209 --> 01:39:44.219 align:start position:0%
under blah blah blah
 
01:39:48.050 --> 01:39:48.060 align:start position:0%
and 266 if we wrote it as it's written
 
01:39:55.370 --> 01:39:55.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:00.110 --> 01:40:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:01.850 --> 01:40:01.860 align:start position:0%
I apologize are you going by with the
 
01:40:04.790 --> 01:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
which which Bill were you no Bill I'm
 
01:40:07.490 --> 01:40:07.500 align:start position:0%
just saying this is what's in the
 
01:40:20.990 --> 01:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:22.550 --> 01:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
that they're allowed to have it if they
 
01:40:30.189 --> 01:40:30.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:33.110 --> 01:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
the complication here is that in a
 
01:40:35.149 --> 01:40:35.159 align:start position:0%
different section of the RSA it says you
 
01:40:37.250 --> 01:40:37.260 align:start position:0%
can't drive with any kind of aftermarket
 
01:40:37.260 --> 01:40:41.149 align:start position:0%
can't drive with any kind of aftermarket
tinting

01:40:41.149 --> 01:40:41.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:43.129 --> 01:40:43.139 align:start position:0%
unless authorized by the director to do
 
01:40:46.129 --> 01:40:46.139 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't say that
 
01:40:49.129 --> 01:40:49.139 align:start position:0%
above it does but the sentence below the
 
01:40:51.229 --> 01:40:51.239 align:start position:0%
sentence after that oh I see okay I see
 
01:40:53.990 --> 01:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:57.110 --> 01:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
no person shall Drive upon any way any
 
01:40:59.330 --> 01:40:59.340 align:start position:0%
vehicle with aftermarket tinting on the
 
01:40:59.340 --> 01:41:01.010 align:start position:0%
vehicle with aftermarket tinting on the
windshield

01:41:01.010 --> 01:41:01.020 align:start position:0%
windshield
 
01:41:04.149 --> 01:41:04.159 align:start position:0%
you know the part about the director
 
01:41:06.770 --> 01:41:06.780 align:start position:0%
is for what's before it
 
01:41:09.890 --> 01:41:09.900 align:start position:0%
okay anyway that those are these are
 
01:41:11.629 --> 01:41:11.639 align:start position:0%
just the technicality but I'm trying to
 
01:41:13.490 --> 01:41:13.500 align:start position:0%
clear it so that
 
01:41:16.129 --> 01:41:16.139 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm telling you and I I have people
 
01:41:18.470 --> 01:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
that tell that go to see inspections and
 
01:41:20.870 --> 01:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
they and the guy will pull out one thing
 
01:41:22.850 --> 01:41:22.860 align:start position:0%
and say Here's this sentence that says
 
01:41:25.790 --> 01:41:25.800 align:start position:0%
you cannot do this and and then
 
01:41:28.250 --> 01:41:28.260 align:start position:0%
somewhere else it says you can
 
01:41:30.229 --> 01:41:30.239 align:start position:0%
um so that's what I'm we're trying to
 
01:41:32.750 --> 01:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
you are correct you are correct so in
 
01:41:35.689 --> 01:41:35.699 align:start position:0%
the 2022 bill it added the aftermarket
 
01:41:38.450 --> 01:41:38.460 align:start position:0%
winch tinting on the windshield so we'd
 
01:41:40.669 --> 01:41:40.679 align:start position:0%
want to remove that completely but then
 
01:41:42.709 --> 01:41:42.719 align:start position:0%
go back to where it was before you were
 
01:41:42.719 --> 01:41:43.790 align:start position:0%
go back to where it was before you were
correct

01:41:43.790 --> 01:41:43.800 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:41:46.729 --> 01:41:46.739 align:start position:0%
the one about things yeah the other one
 
01:41:48.830 --> 01:41:48.840 align:start position:0%
oh um
 
01:41:50.530 --> 01:41:50.540 align:start position:0%
can you explain
 
01:41:53.570 --> 01:41:53.580 align:start position:0%
uh what was the number here here it is
 
01:41:59.570 --> 01:41:59.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:01.850 --> 01:42:01.860 align:start position:0%
under the tinted glass
 
01:42:06.250 --> 01:42:06.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:09.050 --> 01:42:09.060 align:start position:0%
where aftermarket tinting is applied to
 
01:42:10.310 --> 01:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
the windows
 
01:42:13.970 --> 01:42:13.980 align:start position:0%
to the rear of the driver outside
 
01:42:16.129 --> 01:42:16.139 align:start position:0%
tinting on no
 
01:42:19.070 --> 01:42:19.080 align:start position:0%
outside rear view mirror shall be
 
01:42:21.050 --> 01:42:21.060 align:start position:0%
required on both the left and right side
 
01:42:23.649 --> 01:42:23.659 align:start position:0%
of the vehicle for the use of the driver
 
01:42:27.290 --> 01:42:27.300 align:start position:0%
and a front seat passenger
 
01:42:29.750 --> 01:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
why why would we even need outside
 
01:42:33.050 --> 01:42:33.060 align:start position:0%
mirrors for the
 
01:42:35.689 --> 01:42:35.699 align:start position:0%
for the use of the outside of the front
 
01:42:38.030 --> 01:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
seat passenger
 
01:42:40.010 --> 01:42:40.020 align:start position:0%
in all of my years of doing this that's
 
01:42:41.990 --> 01:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
always been in there I I don't I don't
 
01:42:44.330 --> 01:42:44.340 align:start position:0%
know I can't I can't even think of why
 
01:42:47.149 --> 01:42:47.159 align:start position:0%
what we would do anything for the
 
01:42:49.490 --> 01:42:49.500 align:start position:0%
for the benefit of the front seat
 
01:42:52.129 --> 01:42:52.139 align:start position:0%
passenger unless I think as you had
 
01:42:55.550 --> 01:42:55.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned the driver red situation but I
 
01:42:57.770 --> 01:42:57.780 align:start position:0%
I don't know why would we have that in
 
01:42:59.330 --> 01:42:59.340 align:start position:0%
there I
 
01:43:02.930 --> 01:43:02.940 align:start position:0%
if we're changing this we may just X out
 
01:43:06.109 --> 01:43:06.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:11.629 --> 01:43:11.639 align:start position:0%
Mr oberdeen nothing no okay good
 
01:43:11.639 --> 01:43:13.790 align:start position:0%
Mr oberdeen nothing no okay good
um

01:43:13.790 --> 01:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:17.209 --> 01:43:17.219 align:start position:0%
so it sounds like we have
 
01:43:19.430 --> 01:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
some ideas here for
 
01:43:21.590 --> 01:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
changes to be made that we can propose
 
01:43:25.370 --> 01:43:25.380 align:start position:0%
to the committee you yes
 
01:43:25.380 --> 01:43:26.149 align:start position:0%
to the committee you yes
um

01:43:26.149 --> 01:43:26.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:27.890 --> 01:43:27.900 align:start position:0%
is there anything else from the
 
01:43:30.530 --> 01:43:30.540 align:start position:0%
Department that you would
 
01:43:32.930 --> 01:43:32.940 align:start position:0%
like to comment on
 
01:43:35.030 --> 01:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
um I don't think there's any other rsas
 
01:43:37.850 --> 01:43:37.860 align:start position:0%
that are touched in here
 
01:43:37.860 --> 01:43:39.410 align:start position:0%
that are touched in here
um

01:43:39.410 --> 01:43:39.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:41.530 --> 01:43:41.540 align:start position:0%
um it was just yeah
 
01:43:41.540 --> 01:43:43.810 align:start position:0%
um it was just yeah
265.95

01:43:43.810 --> 01:43:43.820 align:start position:0%
265.95
 
01:43:48.890 --> 01:43:48.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:52.010 --> 01:43:52.020 align:start position:0%
yep those are the three I have yes
 
01:43:55.010 --> 01:43:55.020 align:start position:0%
all right I think we should be able to
 
01:43:57.109 --> 01:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
all right pound together or something
 
01:43:59.090 --> 01:43:59.100 align:start position:0%
and give it to the committee for
 
01:43:59.100 --> 01:44:02.390 align:start position:0%
and give it to the committee for
consideration

01:44:02.390 --> 01:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:06.229 --> 01:44:06.239 align:start position:0%
now do we want to uh discuss the other
 
01:44:06.239 --> 01:44:09.649 align:start position:0%
now do we want to uh discuss the other
bill

01:44:09.649 --> 01:44:09.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:11.930 --> 01:44:11.940 align:start position:0%
um so here's my thought on the other
 
01:44:14.629 --> 01:44:14.639 align:start position:0%
Bill and and you can correct me if I'm
 
01:44:16.550 --> 01:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
wrong and actually the prime sponsors
 
01:44:18.530 --> 01:44:18.540 align:start position:0%
here if you would like to correct us as
 
01:44:18.540 --> 01:44:19.729 align:start position:0%
here if you would like to correct us as
well

01:44:19.729 --> 01:44:19.739 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:44:23.390 --> 01:44:23.400 align:start position:0%
my Feeling Hit um my feeling is then we
 
01:44:25.850 --> 01:44:25.860 align:start position:0%
don't have to worry about the 90 that's
 
01:44:27.770 --> 01:44:27.780 align:start position:0%
in that bill yeah
 
01:44:30.709 --> 01:44:30.719 align:start position:0%
that kind of was an error the the
 
01:44:33.649 --> 01:44:33.659 align:start position:0%
concern that the prime sponsor has is
 
01:44:35.930 --> 01:44:35.940 align:start position:0%
more the materials that are being used
 
01:44:38.450 --> 01:44:38.460 align:start position:0%
to do the wavering
 
01:44:41.030 --> 01:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
and to me
 
01:44:42.890 --> 01:44:42.900 align:start position:0%
we don't want to get into the business
 
01:44:44.709 --> 01:44:44.719 align:start position:0%
of of
 
01:44:48.109 --> 01:44:48.119 align:start position:0%
specifying the materials that are used
 
01:44:49.910 --> 01:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
to do the tinting
 
01:44:51.830 --> 01:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
because then we run the risk of having
 
01:44:54.290 --> 01:44:54.300 align:start position:0%
every time technology changes we have to
 
01:44:57.950 --> 01:44:57.960 align:start position:0%
use something we have to amend things
 
01:45:02.570 --> 01:45:02.580 align:start position:0%
if if all we do is is concentrate on the
 
01:45:05.629 --> 01:45:05.639 align:start position:0%
the light transmittance or blocking and
 
01:45:06.910 --> 01:45:06.920 align:start position:0%
I think it's
 
01:45:09.229 --> 01:45:09.239 align:start position:0%
transference or transmittance that we
 
01:45:12.410 --> 01:45:12.420 align:start position:0%
use it doesn't it shouldn't matter what
 
01:45:14.990 --> 01:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
to us what
 
01:45:17.570 --> 01:45:17.580 align:start position:0%
um flavor we use to get to that point
 
01:45:22.310 --> 01:45:22.320 align:start position:0%
what materials so if if in fact that it
 
01:45:27.050 --> 01:45:27.060 align:start position:0%
it blocks visible light to 50 percent
 
01:45:29.090 --> 01:45:29.100 align:start position:0%
but it blocks a hundred percent of
 
01:45:29.100 --> 01:45:32.149 align:start position:0%
but it blocks a hundred percent of
infrared

01:45:32.149 --> 01:45:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:34.010 --> 01:45:34.020 align:start position:0%
we don't care
 
01:45:34.020 --> 01:45:34.669 align:start position:0%
we don't care
um

01:45:34.669 --> 01:45:34.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:37.990 --> 01:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
that's how that's how what to me renders
 
01:45:43.010 --> 01:45:43.020 align:start position:0%
that bill move okay
 
01:45:46.129 --> 01:45:46.139 align:start position:0%
now whether it needs to say in there
 
01:45:48.410 --> 01:45:48.420 align:start position:0%
specifically that
 
01:45:51.530 --> 01:45:51.540 align:start position:0%
the materials used to achieve this
 
01:45:53.689 --> 01:45:53.699 align:start position:0%
don't matter I think I'd leave that up
 
01:45:55.550 --> 01:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
to the committee to decide
 
01:45:58.550 --> 01:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
I didn't I'm not I don't think I'm
 
01:46:01.790 --> 01:46:01.800 align:start position:0%
technically well-versed and in that
 
01:46:03.709 --> 01:46:03.719 align:start position:0%
particular case I would be in favor of
 
01:46:07.729 --> 01:46:07.739 align:start position:0%
just not specifying anything at all okay
 
01:46:10.189 --> 01:46:10.199 align:start position:0%
but that's what I think covers in that
 
01:46:13.250 --> 01:46:13.260 align:start position:0%
bill and I think we don't need to deal
 
01:46:15.290 --> 01:46:15.300 align:start position:0%
anymore we would just recommend that
 
01:46:17.450 --> 01:46:17.460 align:start position:0%
that bill be uh
 
01:46:20.149 --> 01:46:20.159 align:start position:0%
okay be killed did either of you have
 
01:46:24.590 --> 01:46:24.600 align:start position:0%
any other further comments for us okay
 
01:46:27.290 --> 01:46:27.300 align:start position:0%
um representative Hall
 
01:46:38.270 --> 01:46:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:41.090 --> 01:46:41.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:46:43.490 --> 01:46:43.500 align:start position:0%
um so I think we should use the word
 
01:46:45.530 --> 01:46:45.540 align:start position:0%
visible when it says light transmittance
 
01:46:48.109 --> 01:46:48.119 align:start position:0%
as opposed to that solves the issue of
 
01:46:50.870 --> 01:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
infrared UV right the the police
 
01:46:52.910 --> 01:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
officers are worried about being able to
 
01:46:54.470 --> 01:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
see into a window
 
01:46:57.350 --> 01:46:57.360 align:start position:0%
visible addresses that issue because it
 
01:46:58.910 --> 01:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
puts it in a certain spectrum and it's
 
01:47:00.290 --> 01:47:00.300 align:start position:0%
something that can be measured as
 
01:47:01.609 --> 01:47:01.619 align:start position:0%
opposed to infrared you could have 100
 
01:47:04.370 --> 01:47:04.380 align:start position:0%
blockage right zero transmittance in
 
01:47:08.330 --> 01:47:08.340 align:start position:0%
infrared zero transmittance in in UV and
 
01:47:10.430 --> 01:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
that would be acceptable provided the
 
01:47:12.350 --> 01:47:12.360 align:start position:0%
visible spectrum is at that 50 level
 
01:47:15.109 --> 01:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
that you're talking about so adding one
 
01:47:17.330 --> 01:47:17.340 align:start position:0%
word may solve the need to address any
 
01:47:19.609 --> 01:47:19.619 align:start position:0%
material related issues does that make
 
01:47:19.619 --> 01:47:20.450 align:start position:0%
material related issues does that make
sense

01:47:20.450 --> 01:47:20.460 align:start position:0%
sense
 
01:47:22.729 --> 01:47:22.739 align:start position:0%
yeah yep
 
01:47:25.550 --> 01:47:25.560 align:start position:0%
um and I just want to make sure that I
 
01:47:27.169 --> 01:47:27.179 align:start position:0%
understood correctly because there's a
 
01:47:29.090 --> 01:47:29.100 align:start position:0%
large number of large number of states
 
01:47:32.629 --> 01:47:32.639 align:start position:0%
that have 35 or lower for their standard
 
01:47:35.030 --> 01:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire tends to have a bunch
 
01:47:35.040 --> 01:47:36.050 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire tends to have a bunch
of

01:47:36.050 --> 01:47:36.060 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:47:39.709 --> 01:47:39.719 align:start position:0%
people moving here that's a good thing
 
01:47:41.990 --> 01:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
um so all of their cars if they were set
 
01:47:44.030 --> 01:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
up for 35 are going to have to be redone
 
01:47:46.510 --> 01:47:46.520 align:start position:0%
for either windshield or or side view
 
01:47:51.109 --> 01:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
tinting if that if they move here and I
 
01:47:52.729 --> 01:47:52.739 align:start position:0%
guess my concern is would we want to set
 
01:47:54.770 --> 01:47:54.780 align:start position:0%
this up is it 50 for windshield and
 
01:47:57.229 --> 01:47:57.239 align:start position:0%
fifty percent for left and right or zero
 
01:47:59.750 --> 01:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
percent for windshield fifty percent for
 
01:48:02.209 --> 01:48:02.219 align:start position:0%
left and right driver
 
01:48:06.550 --> 01:48:06.560 align:start position:0%
front row seats just the uh
 
01:48:09.709 --> 01:48:09.719 align:start position:0%
for the 50 tinting where is that is that
 
01:48:11.629 --> 01:48:11.639 align:start position:0%
only for the rear view are you talking
 
01:48:13.609 --> 01:48:13.619 align:start position:0%
for the for the
 
01:48:16.129 --> 01:48:16.139 align:start position:0%
for everyone yes for everyone for the no
 
01:48:18.410 --> 01:48:18.420 align:start position:0%
for everyone
 
01:48:19.910 --> 01:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
so what would the standard be for
 
01:48:22.010 --> 01:48:22.020 align:start position:0%
everyone all right well one of the
 
01:48:24.290 --> 01:48:24.300 align:start position:0%
things that we're running into is
 
01:48:26.390 --> 01:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
apparently all the federal standards and
 
01:48:30.050 --> 01:48:30.060 align:start position:0%
everything are using transmission yep at
 
01:48:33.649 --> 01:48:33.659 align:start position:0%
70. uh 70 transmissive
 
01:48:36.530 --> 01:48:36.540 align:start position:0%
which is the opposite of of what's being
 
01:48:36.540 --> 01:48:37.970 align:start position:0%
which is the opposite of of what's being
attenuated

01:48:37.970 --> 01:48:37.980 align:start position:0%
attenuated
 
01:48:37.980 --> 01:48:39.530 align:start position:0%
attenuated
yes

01:48:39.530 --> 01:48:39.540 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:48:42.050 --> 01:48:42.060 align:start position:0%
so that's that's I think that's the
 
01:48:44.209 --> 01:48:44.219 align:start position:0%
number that's the numbers that were used
 
01:48:49.030 --> 01:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
in this uh discussion the 70 is
 
01:48:51.470 --> 01:48:51.480 align:start position:0%
transmissions and that's the federal
 
01:48:53.629 --> 01:48:53.639 align:start position:0%
standard that is kind of the status quo
 
01:48:55.970 --> 01:48:55.980 align:start position:0%
when I put in the bill regarding 90 I
 
01:48:58.070 --> 01:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
was not aware that 70 was actually what
 
01:49:00.530 --> 01:49:00.540 align:start position:0%
was used in all the windows anyway they
 
01:49:02.030 --> 01:49:02.040 align:start position:0%
look clear to me
 
01:49:05.830 --> 01:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
I did notice that transmittance is at 35
 
01:49:09.530 --> 01:49:09.540 align:start position:0%
for the bulk of the States 34-ish states
 
01:49:13.250 --> 01:49:13.260 align:start position:0%
excuse 35 or or less transmittance and
 
01:49:17.570 --> 01:49:17.580 align:start position:0%
we're down to the last 16. with
 
01:49:19.910 --> 01:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
no guys as a standard operating for
 
01:49:21.950 --> 01:49:21.960 align:start position:0%
everybody and then you can go beyond
 
01:49:23.930 --> 01:49:23.940 align:start position:0%
that you can have less transmittance
 
01:49:26.149 --> 01:49:26.159 align:start position:0%
under medical conditions
 
01:49:28.790 --> 01:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
and then starting with Louisiana Utah
 
01:49:30.709 --> 01:49:30.719 align:start position:0%
Minnesota North Dakota Ohio Virginia
 
01:49:32.930 --> 01:49:32.940 align:start position:0%
Wisconsin Alaska California Delaware
 
01:49:35.390 --> 01:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
Iowa right New York Pennsylvania Rhode
 
01:49:37.729 --> 01:49:37.739 align:start position:0%
Island Washington DC et cetera get up to
 
01:49:40.910 --> 01:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:43.310 --> 01:49:43.320 align:start position:0%
um for front winds front side windows
 
01:49:46.370 --> 01:49:46.380 align:start position:0%
right those next to the the rear the
 
01:49:47.689 --> 01:49:47.699 align:start position:0%
side view mirrors and then the
 
01:49:47.699 --> 01:49:49.729 align:start position:0%
side view mirrors and then the
windshield

01:49:49.729 --> 01:49:49.739 align:start position:0%
windshield
 
01:49:52.070 --> 01:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
um and all those other states allow more
 
01:49:55.490 --> 01:49:55.500 align:start position:0%
than 35 percent for rear windows and
 
01:49:58.250 --> 01:49:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:01.550 --> 01:50:01.560 align:start position:0%
so is it fit so just reiterate what you
 
01:50:02.930 --> 01:50:02.940 align:start position:0%
said for the percentage what about when
 
01:50:04.310 --> 01:50:04.320 align:start position:0%
what is windshield going to be going
 
01:50:06.470 --> 01:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
forward what is the side view right side
 
01:50:08.629 --> 01:50:08.639 align:start position:0%
the front side window is going to be
 
01:50:10.370 --> 01:50:10.380 align:start position:0%
what is the rest of the car going to be
 
01:50:15.530 --> 01:50:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:19.310 --> 01:50:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:22.970 --> 01:50:22.980 align:start position:0%
um I would propose right
 
01:50:26.590 --> 01:50:26.600 align:start position:0%
70 for windshield 50 for side windows
 
01:50:29.450 --> 01:50:29.460 align:start position:0%
and if you want to do 50 for the rear
 
01:50:31.129 --> 01:50:31.139 align:start position:0%
windows as well you're you're just going
 
01:50:32.870 --> 01:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
to have a lot of people moving to the
 
01:50:35.330 --> 01:50:35.340 align:start position:0%
state who's right who started off in a
 
01:50:37.729 --> 01:50:37.739 align:start position:0%
different state with 35 and now have to
 
01:50:40.370 --> 01:50:40.380 align:start position:0%
have their Windows their window tinting
 
01:50:42.050 --> 01:50:42.060 align:start position:0%
redone on
 
01:50:44.090 --> 01:50:44.100 align:start position:0%
many of the windows in the car
 
01:50:46.629 --> 01:50:46.639 align:start position:0%
well this particular Bill
 
01:50:49.189 --> 01:50:49.199 align:start position:0%
specifically deals with drivers with
 
01:50:50.570 --> 01:50:50.580 align:start position:0%
medical condition
 
01:50:53.390 --> 01:50:53.400 align:start position:0%
and it's not even just drivers
 
01:50:55.070 --> 01:50:55.080 align:start position:0%
apparently there are certain passengers
 
01:50:59.390 --> 01:50:59.400 align:start position:0%
for which the vehicle is given a waiver
 
01:51:03.830 --> 01:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
I think the better way to say it and the
 
01:51:05.090 --> 01:51:05.100 align:start position:0%
better argument
 
01:51:08.209 --> 01:51:08.219 align:start position:0%
isn't that someone would have to if they
 
01:51:10.430 --> 01:51:10.440 align:start position:0%
moved here would have to change
 
01:51:13.970 --> 01:51:13.980 align:start position:0%
they're tinting at at a at an inspection
 
01:51:17.270 --> 01:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
time yep the better way to say it is
 
01:51:19.850 --> 01:51:19.860 align:start position:0%
there's currently people driving here
 
01:51:19.860 --> 01:51:21.169 align:start position:0%
there's currently people driving here
legally

01:51:21.169 --> 01:51:21.179 align:start position:0%
legally
 
01:51:21.179 --> 01:51:22.490 align:start position:0%
legally
from

01:51:22.490 --> 01:51:22.500 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:51:24.950 --> 01:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
other states that that come and visit
 
01:51:24.960 --> 01:51:26.870 align:start position:0%
other states that that come and visit
here

01:51:26.870 --> 01:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:51:28.970 --> 01:51:28.980 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
01:51:31.129 --> 01:51:31.139 align:start position:0%
some drivers are
 
01:51:34.189 --> 01:51:34.199 align:start position:0%
here in their own cars with that and
 
01:51:37.010 --> 01:51:37.020 align:start position:0%
some are and we're telling our citizens
 
01:51:39.910 --> 01:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
that to drive at a different level right
 
01:51:39.920 --> 01:51:42.010 align:start position:0%
that to drive at a different level right
that's

01:51:42.010 --> 01:51:42.020 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:51:44.570 --> 01:51:44.580 align:start position:0%
I'm in favor of a rule that works really
 
01:51:47.570 --> 01:51:47.580 align:start position:0%
well for for the 95 percent of the cases
 
01:51:49.550 --> 01:51:49.560 align:start position:0%
as they mentioned before 1.5 million
 
01:51:51.649 --> 01:51:51.659 align:start position:0%
vehicles and 500 applications for
 
01:51:54.890 --> 01:51:54.900 align:start position:0%
medical and and the medical being a a
 
01:51:57.530 --> 01:51:57.540 align:start position:0%
unique set but the the rules should be
 
01:51:59.689 --> 01:51:59.699 align:start position:0%
somewhat standard for everybody else and
 
01:52:02.870 --> 01:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the other states and
 
01:52:04.790 --> 01:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
I find it hard to believe that 30 other
 
01:52:08.390 --> 01:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
35 other states 34 other states can find
 
01:52:09.950 --> 01:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
a way to make it work at 35 percent
 
01:52:11.689 --> 01:52:11.699 align:start position:0%
around the vehicle and we're having
 
01:52:15.530 --> 01:52:15.540 align:start position:0%
trouble at 70 and 50 might be the right
 
01:52:18.169 --> 01:52:18.179 align:start position:0%
place to start as a stepping stone
 
01:52:18.179 --> 01:52:18.770 align:start position:0%
place to start as a stepping stone
um

01:52:18.770 --> 01:52:18.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:21.109 --> 01:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
and with a car that's different for the
 
01:52:22.669 --> 01:52:22.679 align:start position:0%
windshield right the windshield may be
 
01:52:24.890 --> 01:52:24.900 align:start position:0%
its own category but
 
01:52:24.900 --> 01:52:25.609 align:start position:0%
its own category but
um

01:52:25.609 --> 01:52:25.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:29.030 --> 01:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
side side windows at the front seat and
 
01:52:31.250 --> 01:52:31.260 align:start position:0%
then back at 50 might be a reasonable
 
01:52:32.810 --> 01:52:32.820 align:start position:0%
place to start and it would be in
 
01:52:34.010 --> 01:52:34.020 align:start position:0%
keeping with
 
01:52:36.229 --> 01:52:36.239 align:start position:0%
kind of middle of the road for the other
 
01:52:38.870 --> 01:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
states what I what I kind of like about
 
01:52:42.050 --> 01:52:42.060 align:start position:0%
that too is that the medical I mean I
 
01:52:44.090 --> 01:52:44.100 align:start position:0%
know we're kind of going off on the side
 
01:52:46.970 --> 01:52:46.980 align:start position:0%
a little bit but the medical waivers I
 
01:52:49.910 --> 01:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
would if I had to bet would go down if
 
01:52:52.669 --> 01:52:52.679 align:start position:0%
we allowed down to 50 you know like on
 
01:52:54.590 --> 01:52:54.600 align:start position:0%
for for at least this you know the side
 
01:52:56.930 --> 01:52:56.940 align:start position:0%
windows and you know the back I'd have
 
01:53:00.050 --> 01:53:00.060 align:start position:0%
to go in and check but I I would I would
 
01:53:03.109 --> 01:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
I would venture to say that the medical
 
01:53:05.030 --> 01:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
exemptions would go down significantly
 
01:53:06.770 --> 01:53:06.780 align:start position:0%
at that point and if you need it down
 
01:53:08.450 --> 01:53:08.460 align:start position:0%
below 50 then you can go at the
 
01:53:10.850 --> 01:53:10.860 align:start position:0%
discretion at the
 
01:53:13.010 --> 01:53:13.020 align:start position:0%
we might be off into the woods here a
 
01:53:15.350 --> 01:53:15.360 align:start position:0%
little bit awesome
 
01:53:19.550 --> 01:53:19.560 align:start position:0%
so just as long as the rules are clear
 
01:53:19.560 --> 01:53:21.709 align:start position:0%
so just as long as the rules are clear
and

01:53:21.709 --> 01:53:21.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:53:23.750 --> 01:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
interpretable by the citizens I guess
 
01:53:25.189 --> 01:53:25.199 align:start position:0%
that's where I would like to go such
 
01:53:27.109 --> 01:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
that it makes it easy to understand what
 
01:53:29.990 --> 01:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
they're being asked be and told so that
 
01:53:31.490 --> 01:53:31.500 align:start position:0%
they don't go to shop one and they're
 
01:53:33.530 --> 01:53:33.540 align:start position:0%
told one thing to go to shop two that
 
01:53:35.510 --> 01:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
leads to confusion that leads to all
 
01:53:37.370 --> 01:53:37.380 align:start position:0%
sorts of issues
 
01:53:39.830 --> 01:53:39.840 align:start position:0%
um whatever the standard is I know what
 
01:53:41.750 --> 01:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
I my preference would be keeping in line
 
01:53:44.030 --> 01:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
with the other 34 states but if we can
 
01:53:45.890 --> 01:53:45.900 align:start position:0%
move in that direction that would be
 
01:53:45.900 --> 01:53:49.189 align:start position:0%
move in that direction that would be
better

01:53:49.189 --> 01:53:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:52.129 --> 01:53:52.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:52.139 --> 01:53:52.910 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:53:52.910 --> 01:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:01.970 --> 01:54:01.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:03.590 --> 01:54:03.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
01:54:05.209 --> 01:54:05.219 align:start position:0%
committee I wasn't going to testify
 
01:54:07.310 --> 01:54:07.320 align:start position:0%
today but
 
01:54:09.830 --> 01:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
listening to all this I thank you for
 
01:54:11.390 --> 01:54:11.400 align:start position:0%
taking this on please introduce yourself
 
01:54:13.850 --> 01:54:13.860 align:start position:0%
oh my sorry thank you thank you uh
 
01:54:16.070 --> 01:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
representative Toms Falls from Hooksett
 
01:54:17.930 --> 01:54:17.940 align:start position:0%
Dunbarton thank you
 
01:54:17.940 --> 01:54:20.149 align:start position:0%
Dunbarton thank you
um

01:54:20.149 --> 01:54:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:22.430 --> 01:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
the goal I was hoping for this
 
01:54:25.129 --> 01:54:25.139 align:start position:0%
subcommittee was to uncomplicate what
 
01:54:29.410 --> 01:54:29.420 align:start position:0%
was complicated when we finally adopted
 
01:54:33.109 --> 01:54:33.119 align:start position:0%
uh 70 for the left and right windows for
 
01:54:35.149 --> 01:54:35.159 align:start position:0%
everybody and that's how this whole
 
01:54:37.189 --> 01:54:37.199 align:start position:0%
thing started once we figured everybody
 
01:54:39.950 --> 01:54:39.960 align:start position:0%
could have 70 percent we looked at the
 
01:54:42.709 --> 01:54:42.719 align:start position:0%
35 percent said that's kind of dark so
 
01:54:44.750 --> 01:54:44.760 align:start position:0%
if everybody can have 70 aftermarket
 
01:54:47.270 --> 01:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
then that was removed from the medical
 
01:54:48.770 --> 01:54:48.780 align:start position:0%
waiver side because you wouldn't have
 
01:54:49.790 --> 01:54:49.800 align:start position:0%
needed it
 
01:54:52.070 --> 01:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
then the windshield got ignored so I
 
01:54:53.930 --> 01:54:53.940 align:start position:0%
mean it all got convoluted and so
 
01:54:56.209 --> 01:54:56.219 align:start position:0%
hopefully at the end of the day we'll
 
01:54:57.950 --> 01:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
try to uncomplicate it because you can
 
01:54:59.530 --> 01:54:59.540 align:start position:0%
see by the front page
 
01:55:01.910 --> 01:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of a lot of complaints and
 
01:55:02.930 --> 01:55:02.940 align:start position:0%
a lot of people don't know what to do
 
01:55:05.330 --> 01:55:05.340 align:start position:0%
with it citizens included uh enforcement
 
01:55:08.930 --> 01:55:08.940 align:start position:0%
and and with the inspection stations
 
01:55:11.270 --> 01:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
in terms of the 50
 
01:55:13.370 --> 01:55:13.380 align:start position:0%
again I gave you this this was the
 
01:55:14.750 --> 01:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
recommendations from the Department of
 
01:55:16.729 --> 01:55:16.739 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicles and Department of Safety
 
01:55:18.709 --> 01:55:18.719 align:start position:0%
uh as you can see because I heard you
 
01:55:20.330 --> 01:55:20.340 align:start position:0%
mentioned it before representative Coker
 
01:55:22.129 --> 01:55:22.139 align:start position:0%
it goes all the way back before we even
 
01:55:24.590 --> 01:55:24.600 align:start position:0%
legalized aftermarket on left and right
 
01:55:26.629 --> 01:55:26.639 align:start position:0%
I hope we don't go that far it took us
 
01:55:28.790 --> 01:55:28.800 align:start position:0%
11 years to get it done
 
01:55:28.800 --> 01:55:30.050 align:start position:0%
11 years to get it done
um

01:55:30.050 --> 01:55:30.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:34.129 --> 01:55:34.139 align:start position:0%
but um I guess trying to unconfuse the
 
01:55:36.950 --> 01:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
medical portion of it is is would be a
 
01:55:38.270 --> 01:55:38.280 align:start position:0%
really good goal
 
01:55:40.790 --> 01:55:40.800 align:start position:0%
in terms of the 50
 
01:55:42.770 --> 01:55:42.780 align:start position:0%
um that might be a good compromise I can
 
01:55:43.910 --> 01:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
tell you I just came back from
 
01:55:46.250 --> 01:55:46.260 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania and I heard they had 35
 
01:55:48.709 --> 01:55:48.719 align:start position:0%
percent and I believe it because it
 
01:55:50.149 --> 01:55:50.159 align:start position:0%
wasn't a car down there that I could
 
01:55:52.310 --> 01:55:52.320 align:start position:0%
walk up to and even see the guy standing
 
01:55:53.570 --> 01:55:53.580 align:start position:0%
behind the steering wheel that is
 
01:55:56.209 --> 01:55:56.219 align:start position:0%
dangerously dark I don't care what other
 
01:55:58.250 --> 01:55:58.260 align:start position:0%
states are doing I think 50 should be
 
01:55:59.930 --> 01:55:59.940 align:start position:0%
the bottom we're looking at if you
 
01:56:01.850 --> 01:56:01.860 align:start position:0%
decide to go down the road of changing
 
01:56:04.629 --> 01:56:04.639 align:start position:0%
left and right for everybody
 
01:56:07.189 --> 01:56:07.199 align:start position:0%
and what you want to do on the on the
 
01:56:09.109 --> 01:56:09.119 align:start position:0%
medical waiver for that Darkness whether
 
01:56:11.750 --> 01:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
keep it to 35 or move it up to 50. again
 
01:56:14.450 --> 01:56:14.460 align:start position:0%
up to you but see conflict we
 
01:56:16.970 --> 01:56:16.980 align:start position:0%
complicated it fixing it and now it's
 
01:56:19.030 --> 01:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
just as in confusing trying to
 
01:56:21.109 --> 01:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
uncomplicate it so good luck on your
 
01:56:22.970 --> 01:56:22.980 align:start position:0%
mission and thank you very much well
 
01:56:25.790 --> 01:56:25.800 align:start position:0%
what we did we did so if you go by the
 
01:56:28.550 --> 01:56:28.560 align:start position:0%
statistics of the number of tint waivers
 
01:56:28.560 --> 01:56:29.570 align:start position:0%
statistics of the number of tint waivers
issued

01:56:29.570 --> 01:56:29.580 align:start position:0%
issued
 
01:56:32.810 --> 01:56:32.820 align:start position:0%
we did solve that to to representative
 
01:56:35.750 --> 01:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
coker's point we did reduce down
 
01:56:40.910 --> 01:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
significantly the number of waivers so
 
01:56:44.030 --> 01:56:44.040 align:start position:0%
so reducing it or
 
01:56:46.450 --> 01:56:46.460 align:start position:0%
maybe even clarifying it
 
01:56:50.090 --> 01:56:50.100 align:start position:0%
did do something we've we've knocked
 
01:56:53.270 --> 01:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
down I don't know uh 600 applications
 
01:56:56.090 --> 01:56:56.100 align:start position:0%
and requests so
 
01:56:57.550 --> 01:56:57.560 align:start position:0%
to your point
 
01:56:59.390 --> 01:56:59.400 align:start position:0%
changing it
 
01:57:01.330 --> 01:57:01.340 align:start position:0%
or lowering it
 
01:57:05.090 --> 01:57:05.100 align:start position:0%
further it probably would be right but
 
01:57:07.490 --> 01:57:07.500 align:start position:0%
at what point do we bump up against that
 
01:57:09.470 --> 01:57:09.480 align:start position:0%
safety issue that's the question and
 
01:57:14.270 --> 01:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
that's yeah and again it's a kind of the
 
01:57:17.149 --> 01:57:17.159 align:start position:0%
um it yeah this stuff is it it you know
 
01:57:18.530 --> 01:57:18.540 align:start position:0%
I don't want to create more problems but
 
01:57:20.149 --> 01:57:20.159 align:start position:0%
I I think it
 
01:57:21.470 --> 01:57:21.480 align:start position:0%
you know what you were talking about
 
01:57:23.930 --> 01:57:23.940 align:start position:0%
with all the administrative rules that I
 
01:57:26.750 --> 01:57:26.760 align:start position:0%
I think if anybody that that 50 I mean
 
01:57:28.729 --> 01:57:28.739 align:start position:0%
that's smack in the middle of most of
 
01:57:30.290 --> 01:57:30.300 align:start position:0%
where the states are you know I mean
 
01:57:32.209 --> 01:57:32.219 align:start position:0%
it's not I don't think it's it's it's
 
01:57:36.470 --> 01:57:36.480 align:start position:0%
crazy and you know enforcing the system
 
01:57:38.810 --> 01:57:38.820 align:start position:0%
will be for the medical waivers which
 
01:57:40.550 --> 01:57:40.560 align:start position:0%
are the people that are really you know
 
01:57:42.350 --> 01:57:42.360 align:start position:0%
who are really affected by this would be
 
01:57:44.629 --> 01:57:44.639 align:start position:0%
I think you'd have a you'd be able to do
 
01:57:47.270 --> 01:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
that more effectively with less waivers
 
01:57:48.830 --> 01:57:48.840 align:start position:0%
to look at so
 
01:57:51.890 --> 01:57:51.900 align:start position:0%
I just but I I'm okay with just I mean
 
01:57:57.410 --> 01:57:57.420 align:start position:0%
I'd take note of the uh the 2023 to date
 
01:58:00.410 --> 01:58:00.420 align:start position:0%
is 583 but we still have another quarter
 
01:58:02.750 --> 01:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
of the year to go
 
01:58:06.770 --> 01:58:06.780 align:start position:0%
we're not going to get to 1185 no but we
 
01:58:09.109 --> 01:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
may get up to 800.
 
01:58:09.119 --> 01:58:10.750 align:start position:0%
may get up to 800.
um

01:58:10.750 --> 01:58:10.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:13.790 --> 01:58:13.800 align:start position:0%
unless it's something that tends not to
 
01:58:16.430 --> 01:58:16.440 align:start position:0%
occur much and we'll we'll find it all
 
01:58:18.169 --> 01:58:18.179 align:start position:0%
in Winter we'll find out there's nothing
 
01:58:19.490 --> 01:58:19.500 align:start position:0%
to say
 
01:58:23.750 --> 01:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
that this can't be an in an incremental
 
01:58:27.050 --> 01:58:27.060 align:start position:0%
uh you know if we do the 50 and then we
 
01:58:30.770 --> 01:58:30.780 align:start position:0%
find that that cuts out this number of
 
01:58:33.229 --> 01:58:33.239 align:start position:0%
medical waivers and then you have a
 
01:58:35.629 --> 01:58:35.639 align:start position:0%
different number later on and it may be
 
01:58:37.729 --> 01:58:37.739 align:start position:0%
that people
 
01:58:40.129 --> 01:58:40.139 align:start position:0%
um it may go the other way it may be
 
01:58:43.609 --> 01:58:43.619 align:start position:0%
that people when they find out that a
 
01:58:46.729 --> 01:58:46.739 align:start position:0%
medical waiver lasts four years
 
01:58:49.010 --> 01:58:49.020 align:start position:0%
well then it's worthwhile for them to go
 
01:58:52.010 --> 01:58:52.020 align:start position:0%
and get one I and so the numbers may go
 
01:58:54.229 --> 01:58:54.239 align:start position:0%
up you do you really I don't think
 
01:58:56.510 --> 01:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
you'll ever you're chasing your tail I
 
01:58:58.970 --> 01:58:58.980 align:start position:0%
think when trying to get statistics to
 
01:59:01.970 --> 01:59:01.980 align:start position:0%
work your way in this no
 
01:59:05.089 --> 01:59:05.099 align:start position:0%
I just said you know to me it's just if
 
01:59:06.530 --> 01:59:06.540 align:start position:0%
we could be more permissive for people I
 
01:59:08.030 --> 01:59:08.040 align:start position:0%
think we should be more permissive if
 
01:59:09.890 --> 01:59:09.900 align:start position:0%
without affecting safe I like this guy
 
01:59:12.229 --> 01:59:12.239 align:start position:0%
which is yeah I'm probably gonna get in
 
01:59:13.330 --> 01:59:13.340 align:start position:0%
trouble for that
 
01:59:16.070 --> 01:59:16.080 align:start position:0%
yeah that's yeah that's in my view 50
 
01:59:18.050 --> 01:59:18.060 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to be a safety issue and if
 
01:59:19.669 --> 01:59:19.679 align:start position:0%
we're gonna willing to let people go
 
01:59:23.390 --> 01:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
down to 35 I mean that's right
 
01:59:25.129 --> 01:59:25.139 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Coker I won't
 
01:59:27.290 --> 01:59:27.300 align:start position:0%
lie to you we tried for 11 years to get
 
01:59:30.290 --> 01:59:30.300 align:start position:0%
aftermarket tent legalized that's why we
 
01:59:31.910 --> 01:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
decided to go with the federal federal
 
01:59:35.750 --> 01:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
the levels so so if if it's your wisdom
 
01:59:37.010 --> 01:59:37.020 align:start position:0%
that we could probably get away with
 
01:59:39.229 --> 01:59:39.239 align:start position:0%
going a little bit darker
 
01:59:40.609 --> 01:59:40.619 align:start position:0%
um I mean that would that's your that's
 
01:59:43.250 --> 01:59:43.260 align:start position:0%
your prerogative but I I still think
 
01:59:46.070 --> 01:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
going to 35 is just way too far but it's
 
01:59:47.689 --> 01:59:47.699 align:start position:0%
just my opinion for the medical waiver
 
01:59:51.169 --> 01:59:51.179 align:start position:0%
no well for yeah yeah yeah I put it this
 
01:59:53.870 --> 01:59:53.880 align:start position:0%
way Limo Black is 18. yeah so 35 is not
 
01:59:56.450 --> 01:59:56.460 align:start position:0%
much later than that I tried at one
 
01:59:58.189 --> 01:59:58.199 align:start position:0%
point to have it
 
02:00:01.970 --> 02:00:01.980 align:start position:0%
be zero to be clear perfectly clear I
 
02:00:04.850 --> 02:00:04.860 align:start position:0%
just wanted to film because the film is
 
02:00:10.070 --> 02:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
what blocks the UV and UVA UVA and V ubb
 
02:00:12.050 --> 02:00:12.060 align:start position:0%
and that was my only concern and I
 
02:00:14.390 --> 02:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
couldn't get that pass uh years ago Okay
 
02:00:14.400 --> 02:00:15.649 align:start position:0%
couldn't get that pass uh years ago Okay
so

02:00:15.649 --> 02:00:15.659 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:00:19.629 --> 02:00:19.639 align:start position:0%
but I I appreciate your your
 
02:00:22.729 --> 02:00:22.739 align:start position:0%
Viewpoint certainly all right I think
 
02:00:22.739 --> 02:00:24.250 align:start position:0%
Viewpoint certainly all right I think
we've

02:00:24.250 --> 02:00:24.260 align:start position:0%
we've
 
02:00:28.370 --> 02:00:28.380 align:start position:0%
Consolidated what we need to address and
 
02:00:32.149 --> 02:00:32.159 align:start position:0%
uh it may continue make some changes uh
 
02:00:35.089 --> 02:00:35.099 align:start position:0%
and basically the
 
02:00:39.649 --> 02:00:39.659 align:start position:0%
the only real concern that was in HB 537
 
02:00:43.430 --> 02:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
we can adopt into this one so
 
02:00:46.550 --> 02:00:46.560 align:start position:0%
put all our effort into
 
02:00:46.560 --> 02:00:48.950 align:start position:0%
put all our effort into
um

02:00:48.950 --> 02:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:52.430 --> 02:00:52.440 align:start position:0%
HP 370.
 
02:00:52.440 --> 02:00:55.070 align:start position:0%
HP 370.
and

02:00:55.070 --> 02:00:55.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:00:58.250 --> 02:00:58.260 align:start position:0%
amongst the things
 
02:01:03.350 --> 02:01:03.360 align:start position:0%
I think we need to try to find out
 
02:01:03.360 --> 02:01:04.490 align:start position:0%
I think we need to try to find out
um

02:01:04.490 --> 02:01:04.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:07.970 --> 02:01:07.980 align:start position:0%
for people with the conditions listed
 
02:01:10.910 --> 02:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
how much light reduction is really
 
02:01:10.920 --> 02:01:15.290 align:start position:0%
how much light reduction is really
needed

02:01:15.290 --> 02:01:15.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:15.300 --> 02:01:16.070 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:01:16.070 --> 02:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:16.080 --> 02:01:18.649 align:start position:0%
um
and

02:01:18.649 --> 02:01:18.659 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:01:24.050 --> 02:01:24.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:27.550 --> 02:01:27.560 align:start position:0%
things to the point where
 
02:01:32.390 --> 02:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
uh not specifying particular ailments
 
02:01:32.400 --> 02:01:34.729 align:start position:0%
uh not specifying particular ailments
but

02:01:34.729 --> 02:01:34.739 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:01:37.550 --> 02:01:37.560 align:start position:0%
um generalizing it is
 
02:01:41.570 --> 02:01:41.580 align:start position:0%
uh issues involving photosensitivity
 
02:01:45.109 --> 02:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
can I suggest that we don't do that
 
02:01:47.570 --> 02:01:47.580 align:start position:0%
but when it comes to the committee
 
02:01:51.350 --> 02:01:51.360 align:start position:0%
someone may want to testify for that
 
02:01:54.649 --> 02:01:54.659 align:start position:0%
number at that point I think it's up to
 
02:01:55.910 --> 02:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
us to
 
02:01:58.430 --> 02:01:58.440 align:start position:0%
to amend this the way
 
02:02:02.629 --> 02:02:02.639 align:start position:0%
we see fit and then and then let it let
 
02:02:04.550 --> 02:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
it be on the committee to decide the
 
02:02:06.850 --> 02:02:06.860 align:start position:0%
full committee to decide whether
 
02:02:10.070 --> 02:02:10.080 align:start position:0%
anyone wants to testify in that okay
 
02:02:12.109 --> 02:02:12.119 align:start position:0%
it's up to the chair to decide whether
 
02:02:14.990 --> 02:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
there'll be any testimony during that
 
02:02:17.270 --> 02:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
executive session so
 
02:02:17.280 --> 02:02:19.010 align:start position:0%
executive session so
okay

02:02:19.010 --> 02:02:19.020 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:02:21.350 --> 02:02:21.360 align:start position:0%
that would be my that would be my
 
02:02:21.360 --> 02:02:24.109 align:start position:0%
that would be my that would be my
recommendations

02:02:24.109 --> 02:02:24.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:26.030 --> 02:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
um I do think
 
02:02:30.229 --> 02:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
I think if it were me I would make that
 
02:02:32.990 --> 02:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
that 35 a 50
 
02:02:35.149 --> 02:02:35.159 align:start position:0%
and I think I would make
 
02:02:38.570 --> 02:02:38.580 align:start position:0%
um the four years for the life of the
 
02:02:40.250 --> 02:02:40.260 align:start position:0%
car ownership
 
02:02:43.609 --> 02:02:43.619 align:start position:0%
knowing that it would still be up to the
 
02:02:45.169 --> 02:02:45.179 align:start position:0%
director to
 
02:02:47.629 --> 02:02:47.639 align:start position:0%
put a put a
 
02:02:50.510 --> 02:02:50.520 align:start position:0%
not to exceed the the life of the car
 
02:02:53.629 --> 02:02:53.639 align:start position:0%
ownership and but other than that we're
 
02:02:55.729 --> 02:02:55.739 align:start position:0%
perfectly fine with how this is I don't
 
02:02:58.010 --> 02:02:58.020 align:start position:0%
mind the four-year part because that
 
02:03:00.350 --> 02:03:00.360 align:start position:0%
also means that if you keep the car for
 
02:03:01.729 --> 02:03:01.739 align:start position:0%
a long time
 
02:03:04.070 --> 02:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
even if it especially if it was a child
 
02:03:06.890 --> 02:03:06.900 align:start position:0%
the child has moved on and it's no
 
02:03:10.370 --> 02:03:10.380 align:start position:0%
longer riding in that car
 
02:03:14.209 --> 02:03:14.219 align:start position:0%
uh the car still has the tinted windows
 
02:03:14.219 --> 02:03:15.530 align:start position:0%
uh the car still has the tinted windows
so

02:03:15.530 --> 02:03:15.540 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:03:19.750 --> 02:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:23.390 --> 02:03:23.400 align:start position:0%
I'm good with the life of the car
 
02:03:25.790 --> 02:03:25.800 align:start position:0%
I don't know why I don't know why we'd
 
02:03:29.930 --> 02:03:29.940 align:start position:0%
make someone do the extra work
 
02:03:32.390 --> 02:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
oh that's true when they may have it and
 
02:03:34.490 --> 02:03:34.500 align:start position:0%
and it obviously if they're driving it
 
02:03:36.770 --> 02:03:36.780 align:start position:0%
and it's and they're sit driving it
 
02:03:36.780 --> 02:03:38.209 align:start position:0%
and it's and they're sit driving it
safely

02:03:38.209 --> 02:03:38.219 align:start position:0%
safely
 
02:03:40.370 --> 02:03:40.380 align:start position:0%
um yeah even if the child isn't there
 
02:03:42.229 --> 02:03:42.239 align:start position:0%
for the last two years that they own the
 
02:03:42.239 --> 02:03:43.970 align:start position:0%
for the last two years that they own the
car

02:03:43.970 --> 02:03:43.980 align:start position:0%
car
 
02:03:47.450 --> 02:03:47.460 align:start position:0%
um they're still driving it safely
 
02:03:49.550 --> 02:03:49.560 align:start position:0%
why why make someone
 
02:03:52.750 --> 02:03:52.760 align:start position:0%
I don't know it's just another piece of
 
02:03:55.669 --> 02:03:55.679 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy as far as I can see and then
 
02:03:58.910 --> 02:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
the only other thing that we
 
02:04:01.189 --> 02:04:01.199 align:start position:0%
ought to do is to find several of the
 
02:04:03.310 --> 02:04:03.320 align:start position:0%
confusing bits of language and other
 
02:04:05.990 --> 02:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
chapters and
 
02:04:08.689 --> 02:04:08.699 align:start position:0%
um and come up with a fix for those so
 
02:04:12.649 --> 02:04:12.659 align:start position:0%
that it'll just be delete line such and
 
02:04:14.450 --> 02:04:14.460 align:start position:0%
such from
 
02:04:17.930 --> 02:04:17.940 align:start position:0%
266 58 blah blah blah especially one
 
02:04:20.510 --> 02:04:20.520 align:start position:0%
says if the car's got tinted windows you
 
02:04:23.629 --> 02:04:23.639 align:start position:0%
can't expect it at all or the one that
 
02:04:25.609 --> 02:04:25.619 align:start position:0%
says that there needs to be for the
 
02:04:27.830 --> 02:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
benefit the windows for the benefit of
 
02:04:29.689 --> 02:04:29.699 align:start position:0%
the front seat passenger
 
02:04:32.510 --> 02:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
well that's the mirror Mac
 
02:04:35.209 --> 02:04:35.219 align:start position:0%
not even the window all right right yeah
 
02:04:38.390 --> 02:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
I misspoke all right I think I think we
 
02:04:40.270 --> 02:04:40.280 align:start position:0%
can put this yeah okay
 
02:04:40.280 --> 02:04:40.910 align:start position:0%
can put this yeah okay
[Music]

02:04:40.910 --> 02:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:04:40.920 --> 02:04:42.169 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

02:04:42.169 --> 02:04:42.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:44.510 --> 02:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
was there anybody else in in the room
 
02:04:47.089 --> 02:04:47.099 align:start position:0%
that had any thing that they thought
 
02:04:49.129 --> 02:04:49.139 align:start position:0%
needed to be added to this before we
 
02:04:50.510 --> 02:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
close it
 
02:04:52.870 --> 02:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
02:04:56.390 --> 02:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
I uh I'll close this
 
02:04:58.609 --> 02:04:58.619 align:start position:0%
uh some committee meeting on work
 
02:05:00.229 --> 02:05:00.239 align:start position:0%
session on
 
02:05:02.410 --> 02:05:02.420 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
02:05:05.030 --> 02:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
370 and
 
03:11:34.790 --> 03:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:36.950 --> 03:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
afternoon everybody
 
03:11:45.469 --> 03:11:45.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:47.809 --> 03:11:47.819 align:start position:0%
so welcome to Transportation this is a
 
03:11:49.610 --> 03:11:49.620 align:start position:0%
work session subcommittee work work
 
03:11:53.210 --> 03:11:53.220 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill 646 relative to
 
03:11:56.210 --> 03:11:56.220 align:start position:0%
prohibiting oh no wrong eliminating the
 
03:11:57.410 --> 03:11:57.420 align:start position:0%
vehicle inspection mandate for
 
03:11:58.969 --> 03:11:58.979 align:start position:0%
non-commercial vehicles
 
03:12:02.929 --> 03:12:02.939 align:start position:0%
uh the committee wasn't prepared to move
 
03:12:05.150 --> 03:12:05.160 align:start position:0%
in that direction so it was agreed to
 
03:12:07.370 --> 03:12:07.380 align:start position:0%
retain the bill hopefully we can work on
 
03:12:09.650 --> 03:12:09.660 align:start position:0%
it and uh see if there's anything we can
 
03:12:11.349 --> 03:12:11.359 align:start position:0%
move forward with
 
03:12:14.230 --> 03:12:14.240 align:start position:0%
what was said at the
 
03:12:17.510 --> 03:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
executive session in the spring when we
 
03:12:17.520 --> 03:12:18.889 align:start position:0%
executive session in the spring when we
determined

03:12:18.889 --> 03:12:18.899 align:start position:0%
determined
 
03:12:18.899 --> 03:12:19.490 align:start position:0%
determined
um

03:12:19.490 --> 03:12:19.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:12:22.730 --> 03:12:22.740 align:start position:0%
the two to retain it
 
03:12:24.469 --> 03:12:24.479 align:start position:0%
is it even though we're not by majority
 
03:12:25.790 --> 03:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
looking at repealing it there are
 
03:12:27.710 --> 03:12:27.720 align:start position:0%
certainly a lot of things that can be
 
03:12:27.720 --> 03:12:29.090 align:start position:0%
certainly a lot of things that can be
improved

03:12:29.090 --> 03:12:29.100 align:start position:0%
improved
 
03:12:31.190 --> 03:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
um one of the topics we looked at was
 
03:12:33.769 --> 03:12:33.779 align:start position:0%
going through the rules which if you
 
03:12:35.510 --> 03:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
have not gone through the rules is a
 
03:12:37.550 --> 03:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
pretty daunting experience
 
03:12:39.349 --> 03:12:39.359 align:start position:0%
so we are in the process of going
 
03:12:42.110 --> 03:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
through them one by one and and looking
 
03:12:44.150 --> 03:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
at especially the ones that people are
 
03:12:45.590 --> 03:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
complaining about on a regular basis
 
03:12:47.809 --> 03:12:47.819 align:start position:0%
it's not the fault anybody some of them
 
03:12:49.610 --> 03:12:49.620 align:start position:0%
are just subjective and it just leaves
 
03:12:51.710 --> 03:12:51.720 align:start position:0%
it into the interpretation of the
 
03:12:54.950 --> 03:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
inspection stations I we have made it
 
03:12:57.830 --> 03:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
through lighting so far I am not going
 
03:13:00.530 --> 03:13:00.540 align:start position:0%
to have you watch us go through this
 
03:13:02.389 --> 03:13:02.399 align:start position:0%
page by Page we'll do some independent
 
03:13:03.830 --> 03:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
research I will schedule another
 
03:13:05.570 --> 03:13:05.580 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting once we get to that
 
03:13:08.870 --> 03:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
point and show you the ones that uh
 
03:13:11.090 --> 03:13:11.100 align:start position:0%
we're put attempting to put in statute
 
03:13:13.490 --> 03:13:13.500 align:start position:0%
just for clarity
 
03:13:16.370 --> 03:13:16.380 align:start position:0%
um I can tell you the ones and I don't
 
03:13:18.290 --> 03:13:18.300 align:start position:0%
want anybody to be alarmed especially in
 
03:13:20.030 --> 03:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
the department of safety we're not going
 
03:13:22.429 --> 03:13:22.439 align:start position:0%
crazy here again we're just looking at
 
03:13:24.050 --> 03:13:24.060 align:start position:0%
the ones that are repeated complaints
 
03:13:25.610 --> 03:13:25.620 align:start position:0%
from our citizens
 
03:13:27.230 --> 03:13:27.240 align:start position:0%
um and the ones that the inspection
 
03:13:29.630 --> 03:13:29.640 align:start position:0%
stations can just have too much levity
 
03:13:31.010 --> 03:13:31.020 align:start position:0%
on interpreting
 
03:13:34.730 --> 03:13:34.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:34.740 --> 03:13:35.870 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:13:35.870 --> 03:13:35.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:13:37.309 --> 03:13:37.319 align:start position:0%
well I'd rather do that I'll give you
 
03:13:40.670 --> 03:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
one example uh rotor brake rotors and
 
03:13:43.910 --> 03:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
rust uh it does say any rust on the
 
03:13:46.190 --> 03:13:46.200 align:start position:0%
rotor and it can be failed we all know
 
03:13:48.590 --> 03:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
that's not true it shouldn't be true and
 
03:13:51.469 --> 03:13:51.479 align:start position:0%
it's just too subjective so we're
 
03:13:52.910 --> 03:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
proposing at this point to remove the
 
03:13:54.950 --> 03:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
word rust because pitting is still there
 
03:13:56.630 --> 03:13:56.640 align:start position:0%
and if you have substantial rust
 
03:13:58.910 --> 03:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
obviously it's going to be pitted and if
 
03:14:00.290 --> 03:14:00.300 align:start position:0%
it's pitted then we all know you're
 
03:14:02.210 --> 03:14:02.220 align:start position:0%
losing your square inches on Surface
 
03:14:04.429 --> 03:14:04.439 align:start position:0%
between the pad and the rotor so I get
 
03:14:06.889 --> 03:14:06.899 align:start position:0%
it but I mean we all know that with the
 
03:14:09.530 --> 03:14:09.540 align:start position:0%
use of calcium chloride sodium chloride
 
03:14:11.690 --> 03:14:11.700 align:start position:0%
and even just to humid months you can
 
03:14:13.370 --> 03:14:13.380 align:start position:0%
have rust on your rotors with it sitting
 
03:14:16.130 --> 03:14:16.140 align:start position:0%
in your driveway for three days and so
 
03:14:17.750 --> 03:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
again those are the things we're just
 
03:14:20.389 --> 03:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
trying to clarify in statute and if we
 
03:14:22.309 --> 03:14:22.319 align:start position:0%
need to remove 541a from it being
 
03:14:23.750 --> 03:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
reinterpreted in the future we'll do
 
03:14:25.910 --> 03:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
that as well again it's just common
 
03:14:27.830 --> 03:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
sense stuff
 
03:14:29.630 --> 03:14:29.640 align:start position:0%
um again I'm not going to go through
 
03:14:31.790 --> 03:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
that with you it's painful to go through
 
03:14:33.469 --> 03:14:33.479 align:start position:0%
them we'll continue that independently
 
03:14:35.990 --> 03:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
and now I will give you the list when we
 
03:14:37.550 --> 03:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
have our next meeting
 
03:14:38.990 --> 03:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
the other thing we've always gotten for
 
03:14:39.000 --> 03:14:41.030 align:start position:0%
the other thing we've always gotten for
complaints

03:14:41.030 --> 03:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
complaints
 
03:14:43.730 --> 03:14:43.740 align:start position:0%
um or for reasons people want to abandon
 
03:14:45.290 --> 03:14:45.300 align:start position:0%
the program
 
03:14:48.290 --> 03:14:48.300 align:start position:0%
predatory shops so one of the
 
03:14:50.750 --> 03:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
suggestions and I'll ask somebody from
 
03:14:53.870 --> 03:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
safety uh in a few minutes I did speak
 
03:14:55.490 --> 03:14:55.500 align:start position:0%
with director marasco I know it's been
 
03:14:57.050 --> 03:14:57.060 align:start position:0%
part of the conversation
 
03:14:59.510 --> 03:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
is to possibly put a hotline or a phone
 
03:15:02.150 --> 03:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
number on your inspection report so that
 
03:15:03.349 --> 03:15:03.359 align:start position:0%
if people feel they've been treated
 
03:15:05.030 --> 03:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
unfairly by the inspection station
 
03:15:07.070 --> 03:15:07.080 align:start position:0%
whether it's they're not doing a good
 
03:15:09.349 --> 03:15:09.359 align:start position:0%
enough job or whether they think they're
 
03:15:13.370 --> 03:15:13.380 align:start position:0%
being oversold shouldn't matter they
 
03:15:15.230 --> 03:15:15.240 align:start position:0%
should have an easy way to get in touch
 
03:15:17.090 --> 03:15:17.100 align:start position:0%
with Troop G so that they can do an
 
03:15:17.100 --> 03:15:18.309 align:start position:0%
with Troop G so that they can do an
audit

03:15:18.309 --> 03:15:18.319 align:start position:0%
audit
 
03:15:20.510 --> 03:15:20.520 align:start position:0%
another thing I'm going to verify today
 
03:15:22.370 --> 03:15:22.380 align:start position:0%
with safety and we'll put on the list is
 
03:15:25.309 --> 03:15:25.319 align:start position:0%
teeth in any statute or any rule statute
 
03:15:27.950 --> 03:15:27.960 align:start position:0%
if we need to that if if an inspection
 
03:15:29.929 --> 03:15:29.939 align:start position:0%
station is going to continue
 
03:15:32.570 --> 03:15:32.580 align:start position:0%
whether it be not inspect properly or
 
03:15:32.580 --> 03:15:34.269 align:start position:0%
whether it be not inspect properly or
oversell

03:15:34.269 --> 03:15:34.279 align:start position:0%
oversell
 
03:15:36.349 --> 03:15:36.359 align:start position:0%
we're going to draw a line in the sand
 
03:15:38.150 --> 03:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
you get so many violations before we
 
03:15:39.530 --> 03:15:39.540 align:start position:0%
take the nice green and white sign off
 
03:15:41.269 --> 03:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
the side of your building but
 
03:15:43.010 --> 03:15:43.020 align:start position:0%
something's got to happen to stop our
 
03:15:44.630 --> 03:15:44.640 align:start position:0%
citizens from being taken advantage of
 
03:15:46.610 --> 03:15:46.620 align:start position:0%
again we're truly just trying to make
 
03:15:49.090 --> 03:15:49.100 align:start position:0%
this a better better program
 
03:15:52.849 --> 03:15:52.859 align:start position:0%
that is the bulk of what we originally
 
03:15:54.889 --> 03:15:54.899 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
03:15:58.490 --> 03:15:58.500 align:start position:0%
um and for reasons of retaining
 
03:15:58.500 --> 03:15:59.030 align:start position:0%
um and for reasons of retaining
um

03:15:59.030 --> 03:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:16:00.889 --> 03:16:00.899 align:start position:0%
there is another idea being floated
 
03:16:02.809 --> 03:16:02.819 align:start position:0%
around I don't know if we want to attach
 
03:16:04.309 --> 03:16:04.319 align:start position:0%
it to this I'll speak to my two
 
03:16:06.469 --> 03:16:06.479 align:start position:0%
colleagues and their opinions there has
 
03:16:09.349 --> 03:16:09.359 align:start position:0%
been some uh conversation floated around
 
03:16:10.849 --> 03:16:10.859 align:start position:0%
I think we have a bill to introduced too
 
03:16:13.070 --> 03:16:13.080 align:start position:0%
that might exempt the first year of a
 
03:16:14.630 --> 03:16:14.640 align:start position:0%
brand new vehicle
 
03:16:16.969 --> 03:16:16.979 align:start position:0%
again whether we take it up on this bill
 
03:16:20.030 --> 03:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
or attach it or look at one of the I
 
03:16:21.710 --> 03:16:21.720 align:start position:0%
hear five already introduced on
 
03:16:24.349 --> 03:16:24.359 align:start position:0%
inspections for next year
 
03:16:27.010 --> 03:16:27.020 align:start position:0%
um we'll make that determination later
 
03:16:30.349 --> 03:16:30.359 align:start position:0%
what's your thoughts on either one of
 
03:16:32.990 --> 03:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
you on on the scope of what we want to
 
03:16:35.210 --> 03:16:35.220 align:start position:0%
do here
 
03:16:35.220 --> 03:16:36.410 align:start position:0%
do here
anybody

03:16:36.410 --> 03:16:36.420 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
03:16:36.420 --> 03:16:40.309 align:start position:0%
anybody
yep

03:16:40.309 --> 03:16:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:42.370 --> 03:16:42.380 align:start position:0%
yeah that works for me especially
 
03:16:45.170 --> 03:16:45.180 align:start position:0%
digging into if we want people to have
 
03:16:47.030 --> 03:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
confidence in the safety inspection
 
03:16:49.070 --> 03:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
program it needs to be a safety
 
03:16:51.590 --> 03:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
inspection program not a revenue
 
03:16:54.230 --> 03:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
generating program we had an incident
 
03:16:56.990 --> 03:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
with someone that works here
 
03:17:00.410 --> 03:17:00.420 align:start position:0%
um like 10 or 12 year old Toyota Corolla
 
03:17:02.570 --> 03:17:02.580 align:start position:0%
common car cheap parts once you get it
 
03:17:04.730 --> 03:17:04.740 align:start position:0%
inspected said Shanita bricks okay fair
 
03:17:07.370 --> 03:17:07.380 align:start position:0%
enough eleven hundred dollars
 
03:17:09.650 --> 03:17:09.660 align:start position:0%
because what a lot of the shops really
 
03:17:12.050 --> 03:17:12.060 align:start position:0%
like to do is rip everything off you
 
03:17:13.429 --> 03:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
don't have to save any of the old Parts
 
03:17:16.550 --> 03:17:16.560 align:start position:0%
by the way that's hard sometimes and
 
03:17:18.170 --> 03:17:18.180 align:start position:0%
instead just assemble all brand new
 
03:17:20.090 --> 03:17:20.100 align:start position:0%
parts so that price I looked up the
 
03:17:21.889 --> 03:17:21.899 align:start position:0%
parts they were just going to do
 
03:17:26.210 --> 03:17:26.220 align:start position:0%
calipers brakes rotors Hardware kits
 
03:17:28.070 --> 03:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
whether it needed them or not I mean
 
03:17:28.080 --> 03:17:29.210 align:start position:0%
whether it needed them or not I mean
everything

03:17:29.210 --> 03:17:29.220 align:start position:0%
everything
 
03:17:32.269 --> 03:17:32.279 align:start position:0%
instead we took the we sold it don't do
 
03:17:34.670 --> 03:17:34.680 align:start position:0%
it just don't do it took it to another
 
03:17:37.550 --> 03:17:37.560 align:start position:0%
shop 350 bucks they changed out the
 
03:17:39.349 --> 03:17:39.359 align:start position:0%
parts that were bad the car is safe
 
03:17:42.050 --> 03:17:42.060 align:start position:0%
that's a safety inspection not the shop
 
03:17:43.730 --> 03:17:43.740 align:start position:0%
that did the eleven hundred dollars and
 
03:17:46.610 --> 03:17:46.620 align:start position:0%
we need to get a handle on that or the
 
03:17:48.349 --> 03:17:48.359 align:start position:0%
Uproar against safety inspection
 
03:17:51.290 --> 03:17:51.300 align:start position:0%
programs is going to continue get worse
 
03:17:53.090 --> 03:17:53.100 align:start position:0%
and you'll be headed for a repeal if
 
03:17:55.309 --> 03:17:55.319 align:start position:0%
this continues and it'll pass at some
 
03:17:59.050 --> 03:17:59.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:04.070 --> 03:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
thank you anything Pam yeah okay so
 
03:18:06.050 --> 03:18:06.060 align:start position:0%
I guess I gotta get this a little closer
 
03:18:07.610 --> 03:18:07.620 align:start position:0%
there we go
 
03:18:09.170 --> 03:18:09.180 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:18:12.170 --> 03:18:12.180 align:start position:0%
conceptually I'm I actually am in
 
03:18:13.969 --> 03:18:13.979 align:start position:0%
support of the idea of making sure that
 
03:18:15.349 --> 03:18:15.359 align:start position:0%
there's a phone number readily
 
03:18:18.050 --> 03:18:18.060 align:start position:0%
accessible that people can call doesn't
 
03:18:19.910 --> 03:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
cost them anything that it gets them to
 
03:18:21.349 --> 03:18:21.359 align:start position:0%
Troop G if they feel they've been
 
03:18:26.030 --> 03:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
aggrieved by a workshop and um that's
 
03:18:28.490 --> 03:18:28.500 align:start position:0%
only good open public government and I
 
03:18:31.429 --> 03:18:31.439 align:start position:0%
think that makes perfect sense to me I
 
03:18:33.170 --> 03:18:33.180 align:start position:0%
also think that
 
03:18:33.180 --> 03:18:35.269 align:start position:0%
also think that
um

03:18:35.269 --> 03:18:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:39.050 --> 03:18:39.060 align:start position:0%
if a particular shop has
 
03:18:41.210 --> 03:18:41.220 align:start position:0%
a more significant number of complaints
 
03:18:42.830 --> 03:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
than others then there should be a
 
03:18:42.840 --> 03:18:44.330 align:start position:0%
than others then there should be a
process

03:18:44.330 --> 03:18:44.340 align:start position:0%
process
 
03:18:47.030 --> 03:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
where that can be
 
03:18:47.040 --> 03:18:48.950 align:start position:0%
where that can be
um

03:18:48.950 --> 03:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:50.990 --> 03:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
I hate to use the word adjudicated but
 
03:18:53.450 --> 03:18:53.460 align:start position:0%
it could be looked at it for sure my
 
03:18:55.969 --> 03:18:55.979 align:start position:0%
only concern with that piece of it is do
 
03:18:57.950 --> 03:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
we have
 
03:18:57.960 --> 03:18:59.690 align:start position:0%
we have
um

03:18:59.690 --> 03:18:59.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:19:02.330 --> 03:19:02.340 align:start position:0%
I know we have data about the numbers of
 
03:19:05.410 --> 03:19:05.420 align:start position:0%
yearly inspections that are taking place
 
03:19:08.450 --> 03:19:08.460 align:start position:0%
but have have either of you gentlemen
 
03:19:10.610 --> 03:19:10.620 align:start position:0%
receive the number of complaints that
 
03:19:12.110 --> 03:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
have been received
 
03:19:15.410 --> 03:19:15.420 align:start position:0%
because I think that's you know a piece
 
03:19:17.690 --> 03:19:17.700 align:start position:0%
of the data that we should have as we
 
03:19:20.210 --> 03:19:20.220 align:start position:0%
continue the discussion
 
03:19:23.690 --> 03:19:23.700 align:start position:0%
um you know if it's 18 complaints a year
 
03:19:26.349 --> 03:19:26.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:26.359 --> 03:19:28.010 align:start position:0%
 
250

03:19:28.010 --> 03:19:28.020 align:start position:0%
250
 
03:19:28.020 --> 03:19:29.830 align:start position:0%
250
000

03:19:29.830 --> 03:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
000
 
03:19:33.889 --> 03:19:33.899 align:start position:0%
inspections then I I you know I I think
 
03:19:35.929 --> 03:19:35.939 align:start position:0%
we have to take a look at that if it's
 
03:19:38.630 --> 03:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
18 inspections
 
03:19:40.790 --> 03:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
all of which come from one shop then
 
03:19:43.550 --> 03:19:43.560 align:start position:0%
that's certainly a concern
 
03:19:45.590 --> 03:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
um so that's you know I I think we we
 
03:19:47.750 --> 03:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
need a little more data to to move on
 
03:19:50.210 --> 03:19:50.220 align:start position:0%
those two fronts and I think that's uh
 
03:19:52.630 --> 03:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
worthwhile place to continue
 
03:19:52.640 --> 03:19:52.910 align:start position:0%
worthwhile place to continue
[Music]

03:19:52.910 --> 03:19:52.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:19:52.920 --> 03:19:54.530 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

03:19:54.530 --> 03:19:54.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:19:54.540 --> 03:19:56.750 align:start position:0%
um
I

03:19:56.750 --> 03:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
I
 
03:20:01.190 --> 03:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
I think that's you know in terms of the
 
03:20:01.200 --> 03:20:03.170 align:start position:0%
I think that's you know in terms of the
uh

03:20:03.170 --> 03:20:03.180 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:20:05.090 --> 03:20:05.100 align:start position:0%
coming having another subcommittee
 
03:20:06.910 --> 03:20:06.920 align:start position:0%
meeting to
 
03:20:10.370 --> 03:20:10.380 align:start position:0%
uh look at
 
03:20:12.830 --> 03:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
these particular points would be useful
 
03:20:16.010 --> 03:20:16.020 align:start position:0%
for both the industry and for us
 
03:20:18.410 --> 03:20:18.420 align:start position:0%
and I'm okay with that too
 
03:20:18.420 --> 03:20:19.070 align:start position:0%
and I'm okay with that too
um

03:20:19.070 --> 03:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:20:21.530 --> 03:20:21.540 align:start position:0%
relative to moving
 
03:20:25.250 --> 03:20:25.260 align:start position:0%
taking a look at some more substantive
 
03:20:25.260 --> 03:20:27.290 align:start position:0%
taking a look at some more substantive
changes

03:20:27.290 --> 03:20:27.300 align:start position:0%
changes
 
03:20:27.300 --> 03:20:28.370 align:start position:0%
changes
um

03:20:28.370 --> 03:20:28.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:20:30.889 --> 03:20:30.899 align:start position:0%
rather than tacking it on to a bill
 
03:20:34.429 --> 03:20:34.439 align:start position:0%
after just you know a
 
03:20:36.110 --> 03:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
the amount of time that we have
 
03:20:38.929 --> 03:20:38.939 align:start position:0%
available to us this year I would much
 
03:20:42.110 --> 03:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
rather prefer to see the legislation
 
03:20:44.990 --> 03:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
that is submitted and then have real
 
03:20:47.510 --> 03:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
actual subcommittee work prior to
 
03:20:50.809 --> 03:20:50.819 align:start position:0%
executing with plenty of time to take up
 
03:20:54.650 --> 03:20:54.660 align:start position:0%
any other possible more if the if
 
03:20:56.090 --> 03:20:56.100 align:start position:0%
there's a need for more substantive
 
03:20:59.269 --> 03:20:59.279 align:start position:0%
changes that's that's my view
 
03:21:01.190 --> 03:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
fair enough and I have to be honest with
 
03:21:02.389 --> 03:21:02.399 align:start position:0%
you the more I think about it I think
 
03:21:03.889 --> 03:21:03.899 align:start position:0%
that is the right way to go it seems
 
03:21:05.870 --> 03:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
like we have other vehicles and we have
 
03:21:08.210 --> 03:21:08.220 align:start position:0%
a bill that's kind of specific so uh to
 
03:21:10.849 --> 03:21:10.859 align:start position:0%
keep it simple and to risk torpedoing
 
03:21:12.950 --> 03:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
good work on the rest of it I think we
 
03:21:16.730 --> 03:21:16.740 align:start position:0%
can separate the two you agree
 
03:21:18.950 --> 03:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh okay I think the next step and some
 
03:21:20.210 --> 03:21:20.220 align:start position:0%
of the questions you had representative
 
03:21:22.910 --> 03:21:22.920 align:start position:0%
Sykes I'll ask somebody from the
 
03:21:26.030 --> 03:21:26.040 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety to come up uh we've
 
03:21:27.769 --> 03:21:27.779 align:start position:0%
got a couple of questions I know
 
03:21:28.730 --> 03:21:28.740 align:start position:0%
representative Sykes had one
 
03:21:28.740 --> 03:21:36.110 align:start position:0%
representative Sykes had one
specifically

03:21:36.110 --> 03:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:37.370 --> 03:21:37.380 align:start position:0%
if we can't get the answer right this
 
03:21:39.170 --> 03:21:39.180 align:start position:0%
moment certainly you can have it for us
 
03:21:41.990 --> 03:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
for the if it exists the data for the
 
03:21:44.750 --> 03:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
next subcommittee meeting
 
03:21:44.760 --> 03:21:46.309 align:start position:0%
next subcommittee meeting
yeah

03:21:46.309 --> 03:21:46.319 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:21:48.650 --> 03:21:48.660 align:start position:0%
um and then for lieutenant O'Leary you
 
03:21:50.030 --> 03:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
were out of the room I think just we're
 
03:21:52.250 --> 03:21:52.260 align:start position:0%
going over the scope real quickly we're
 
03:21:53.870 --> 03:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
not going to do it today and bore
 
03:21:55.370 --> 03:21:55.380 align:start position:0%
everybody but we are going through the
 
03:21:57.410 --> 03:21:57.420 align:start position:0%
rules and just looking at the ones that
 
03:21:59.330 --> 03:21:59.340 align:start position:0%
that I've received complaints on in
 
03:22:01.610 --> 03:22:01.620 align:start position:0%
terms of their subjectivity
 
03:22:03.830 --> 03:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
um when we have those formalized we'll
 
03:22:05.570 --> 03:22:05.580 align:start position:0%
schedule another another meeting we can
 
03:22:07.309 --> 03:22:07.319 align:start position:0%
go over them but speaking of complaints
 
03:22:08.570 --> 03:22:08.580 align:start position:0%
one of the questions representative
 
03:22:11.389 --> 03:22:11.399 align:start position:0%
Sykes has do we have any data on how
 
03:22:13.550 --> 03:22:13.560 align:start position:0%
many complaints do we get on an annual
 
03:22:16.010 --> 03:22:16.020 align:start position:0%
basis I'm I can speak for myself as a
 
03:22:18.110 --> 03:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
legislator I get a ton of them but I
 
03:22:19.969 --> 03:22:19.979 align:start position:0%
don't have a number sure now
 
03:22:21.230 --> 03:22:21.240 align:start position:0%
representative I appreciate the question
 
03:22:23.690 --> 03:22:23.700 align:start position:0%
uh so after leaving the session last
 
03:22:26.630 --> 03:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
year that question was posed and we went
 
03:22:28.250 --> 03:22:28.260 align:start position:0%
back to look at you know what do we have
 
03:22:30.050 --> 03:22:30.060 align:start position:0%
for numbers available and what we
 
03:22:32.210 --> 03:22:32.220 align:start position:0%
quickly Learned was the challenges that
 
03:22:34.610 --> 03:22:34.620 align:start position:0%
are faced by the consumer is that there
 
03:22:37.250 --> 03:22:37.260 align:start position:0%
is not a direct line for complaints to
 
03:22:40.190 --> 03:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
be received the complaints are some go
 
03:22:43.190 --> 03:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
to Department of Justice uh consumer
 
03:22:45.710 --> 03:22:45.720 align:start position:0%
protection some go to to the dealer
 
03:22:48.530 --> 03:22:48.540 align:start position:0%
inspection desk cut some come to Troop G
 
03:22:50.990 --> 03:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
directly so I could provide you with
 
03:22:52.550 --> 03:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
numbers of cases that we've had for
 
03:22:54.349 --> 03:22:54.359 align:start position:0%
complaints for Troop G alone but I
 
03:22:56.090 --> 03:22:56.100 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be doing you a service and
 
03:22:58.849 --> 03:22:58.859 align:start position:0%
really giving you a complete number so
 
03:23:00.410 --> 03:23:00.420 align:start position:0%
that that is the challenge that we that
 
03:23:02.150 --> 03:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
we found leaving here but to help
 
03:23:04.550 --> 03:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
Rectify that situation and I don't know
 
03:23:05.929 --> 03:23:05.939 align:start position:0%
if this is already discussed if it is
 
03:23:08.090 --> 03:23:08.100 align:start position:0%
you can shut me off to help Rectify that
 
03:23:09.830 --> 03:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
situation we met with the Attorney
 
03:23:11.990 --> 03:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
General's office consumer protection
 
03:23:15.110 --> 03:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
attorney along with the DMV and
 
03:23:17.330 --> 03:23:17.340 align:start position:0%
obviously Troop G and had a discussion
 
03:23:19.250 --> 03:23:19.260 align:start position:0%
on how can we centralize these
 
03:23:21.830 --> 03:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
complaints and therefore it makes it
 
03:23:23.870 --> 03:23:23.880 align:start position:0%
much easier for the general public to
 
03:23:26.450 --> 03:23:26.460 align:start position:0%
call or email one number or one email
 
03:23:28.790 --> 03:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
address so that now we can start to
 
03:23:31.309 --> 03:23:31.319 align:start position:0%
collect the data to show you know what
 
03:23:32.750 --> 03:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
we are receiving for complaints so
 
03:23:34.190 --> 03:23:34.200 align:start position:0%
that's the direction that we've worked
 
03:23:35.929 --> 03:23:35.939 align:start position:0%
we're sitting in a pretty good
 
03:23:37.790 --> 03:23:37.800 align:start position:0%
foundation moving forward with that and
 
03:23:38.929 --> 03:23:38.939 align:start position:0%
I'd be more than happy to discuss that
 
03:23:40.130 --> 03:23:40.140 align:start position:0%
with you but I just want to let you know
 
03:23:41.389 --> 03:23:41.399 align:start position:0%
that that's the changes we made since
 
03:23:44.090 --> 03:23:44.100 align:start position:0%
last session to help centralize those
 
03:23:45.590 --> 03:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
complaints as they come in so we can
 
03:23:50.210 --> 03:23:50.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:51.830 --> 03:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
um I know you've run it through your
 
03:23:54.650 --> 03:23:54.660 align:start position:0%
legal department or even Beyond has it
 
03:23:56.450 --> 03:23:56.460 align:start position:0%
come back in time to see any possible
 
03:23:56.460 --> 03:23:57.650 align:start position:0%
come back in time to see any possible
language

03:23:57.650 --> 03:23:57.660 align:start position:0%
language
 
03:23:59.330 --> 03:23:59.340 align:start position:0%
so I can share with you the language
 
03:24:02.210 --> 03:24:02.220 align:start position:0%
that we proposed it's uh to my knowledge
 
03:24:05.150 --> 03:24:05.160 align:start position:0%
has not been necessarily approved yet by
 
03:24:07.190 --> 03:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
our legal or by DMV legal I should say
 
03:24:09.110 --> 03:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
but I would like to share it with you
 
03:24:11.690 --> 03:24:11.700 align:start position:0%
just so you have an idea of of what we
 
03:24:13.550 --> 03:24:13.560 align:start position:0%
are looking to do
 
03:24:15.590 --> 03:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
one of the discussions that came up or
 
03:24:17.630 --> 03:24:17.640 align:start position:0%
ideas that came up last year was to
 
03:24:19.490 --> 03:24:19.500 align:start position:0%
maybe have signage at the locations of
 
03:24:20.929 --> 03:24:20.939 align:start position:0%
where the inspection stations are to
 
03:24:23.570 --> 03:24:23.580 align:start position:0%
notify consumers uh regarding where they
 
03:24:25.790 --> 03:24:25.800 align:start position:0%
can call to make a complaint the
 
03:24:27.530 --> 03:24:27.540 align:start position:0%
challenges that we had with that idea
 
03:24:29.570 --> 03:24:29.580 align:start position:0%
was we were concerned that because it's
 
03:24:31.910 --> 03:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
it's not administratively required at
 
03:24:33.710 --> 03:24:33.720 align:start position:0%
this time we wouldn't really be able to
 
03:24:35.389 --> 03:24:35.399 align:start position:0%
hold a station accountable if they chose
 
03:24:38.090 --> 03:24:38.100 align:start position:0%
not to do that so everybody receives a
 
03:24:40.969 --> 03:24:40.979 align:start position:0%
vehicle inspection report and what we
 
03:24:42.530 --> 03:24:42.540 align:start position:0%
wanted to do was provide language on
 
03:24:44.330 --> 03:24:44.340 align:start position:0%
that vehicle inspection report that
 
03:24:48.110 --> 03:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
would direct a driver who has failed
 
03:24:49.910 --> 03:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
their safety inspection to where they
 
03:24:52.370 --> 03:24:52.380 align:start position:0%
need to go so on the vehicle inspection
 
03:24:53.929 --> 03:24:53.939 align:start position:0%
report if you're familiar with those
 
03:24:57.469 --> 03:24:57.479 align:start position:0%
right after the section that speaks to
 
03:25:00.110 --> 03:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
the parts on the car that were found to
 
03:25:02.330 --> 03:25:02.340 align:start position:0%
be deficient there's a line that we
 
03:25:04.250 --> 03:25:04.260 align:start position:0%
propose to be added that says concerns
 
03:25:05.389 --> 03:25:05.399 align:start position:0%
of questions regarding the state
 
03:25:07.550 --> 03:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
inspection or the practices of
 
03:25:09.710 --> 03:25:09.720 align:start position:0%
inspection stations may be refer to the
 
03:25:11.210 --> 03:25:11.220 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of Safety State
 
03:25:13.070 --> 03:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
Police Troop G at and then there's an
 
03:25:14.570 --> 03:25:14.580 align:start position:0%
email address address and a phone number
 
03:25:16.550 --> 03:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
working with the Attorney General's
 
03:25:18.950 --> 03:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
office and the DMV what we decided was
 
03:25:20.389 --> 03:25:20.399 align:start position:0%
collectively the way that it would work
 
03:25:22.429 --> 03:25:22.439 align:start position:0%
is that we could you know start to
 
03:25:24.349 --> 03:25:24.359 align:start position:0%
funnel those those complaints and then
 
03:25:25.790 --> 03:25:25.800 align:start position:0%
we could fish them out to the proper
 
03:25:27.769 --> 03:25:27.779 align:start position:0%
Agency for to address them but at least
 
03:25:29.570 --> 03:25:29.580 align:start position:0%
we would have an idea of the number of
 
03:25:31.130 --> 03:25:31.140 align:start position:0%
complaints that were coming in and the
 
03:25:32.389 --> 03:25:32.399 align:start position:0%
general concerns that were being
 
03:25:34.490 --> 03:25:34.500 align:start position:0%
presented we thought that this provided
 
03:25:35.929 --> 03:25:35.939 align:start position:0%
an opportunity for everybody that's
 
03:25:38.570 --> 03:25:38.580 align:start position:0%
getting a vehicle inspection report to
 
03:25:40.190 --> 03:25:40.200 align:start position:0%
clearly be notified of where they can
 
03:25:41.269 --> 03:25:41.279 align:start position:0%
make that
 
03:25:44.330 --> 03:25:44.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:46.130 --> 03:25:46.140 align:start position:0%
everybody else
 
03:25:49.370 --> 03:25:49.380 align:start position:0%
thank you for that it sounds good uh
 
03:25:51.889 --> 03:25:51.899 align:start position:0%
just going along with that is there
 
03:25:53.750 --> 03:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
currently either in rural or in statute
 
03:25:55.210 --> 03:25:55.220 align:start position:0%
that you know of
 
03:25:58.010 --> 03:25:58.020 align:start position:0%
enforcement mechanisms for shops that
 
03:25:59.870 --> 03:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
are in violation of any of the
 
03:26:02.389 --> 03:26:02.399 align:start position:0%
administrative rules or if they have bad
 
03:26:05.030 --> 03:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
audit audits on a regular basis
 
03:26:07.309 --> 03:26:07.319 align:start position:0%
yes so the way that it works currently
 
03:26:09.530 --> 03:26:09.540 align:start position:0%
if we go in to do an audit or if we've
 
03:26:12.410 --> 03:26:12.420 align:start position:0%
received a complaint from a from a you
 
03:26:14.630 --> 03:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
know a driver of the state that had an
 
03:26:16.309 --> 03:26:16.319 align:start position:0%
issue with their state inspection and we
 
03:26:18.710 --> 03:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
go in and conduct an investigation uh
 
03:26:20.090 --> 03:26:20.100 align:start position:0%
based upon whatever that auditor
 
03:26:21.950 --> 03:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
investigation reveals there are two
 
03:26:23.330 --> 03:26:23.340 align:start position:0%
avenues that can be taken which are
 
03:26:24.769 --> 03:26:24.779 align:start position:0%
administrative action where we could
 
03:26:28.130 --> 03:26:28.140 align:start position:0%
suspend the license of the station as
 
03:26:29.690 --> 03:26:29.700 align:start position:0%
well as the mechanic certificate who
 
03:26:32.330 --> 03:26:32.340 align:start position:0%
performed the inspection or depending on
 
03:26:34.370 --> 03:26:34.380 align:start position:0%
how egregious it is there are also
 
03:26:36.290 --> 03:26:36.300 align:start position:0%
criminal charges that could come and
 
03:26:40.250 --> 03:26:40.260 align:start position:0%
play it as well so there are mechanisms
 
03:26:42.889 --> 03:26:42.899 align:start position:0%
in place to be able to address those
 
03:26:44.690 --> 03:26:44.700 align:start position:0%
stations or mechanics that are found to
 
03:26:48.229 --> 03:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
be you know not performing
 
03:26:50.090 --> 03:26:50.100 align:start position:0%
thank you I think the egregious ones for
 
03:26:52.130 --> 03:26:52.140 align:start position:0%
me are the ones that oversell do you
 
03:26:53.389 --> 03:26:53.399 align:start position:0%
think what we have in place is
 
03:26:54.950 --> 03:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
sufficient or do we need something with
 
03:26:56.929 --> 03:26:56.939 align:start position:0%
more teeth or maybe with a more
 
03:26:59.389 --> 03:26:59.399 align:start position:0%
with a little more reason for people not
 
03:27:01.610 --> 03:27:01.620 align:start position:0%
to want to do it so if the concern of
 
03:27:03.650 --> 03:27:03.660 align:start position:0%
the committee is mechanics that are
 
03:27:05.630 --> 03:27:05.640 align:start position:0%
upselling for
 
03:27:05.640 --> 03:27:07.070 align:start position:0%
upselling for
um

03:27:07.070 --> 03:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:27:09.969 --> 03:27:09.979 align:start position:0%
services that may not necessarily be
 
03:27:12.710 --> 03:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
needed the way that it would be
 
03:27:14.809 --> 03:27:14.819 align:start position:0%
addressed now would be under the
 
03:27:16.070 --> 03:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
administrative rule for whatever
 
03:27:18.290 --> 03:27:18.300 align:start position:0%
component that they are trying to upsell
 
03:27:20.570 --> 03:27:20.580 align:start position:0%
so for example if you had an individual
 
03:27:22.490 --> 03:27:22.500 align:start position:0%
who was told they needed new brake pads
 
03:27:24.349 --> 03:27:24.359 align:start position:0%
there's no administrative rule that
 
03:27:26.870 --> 03:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
speaks to upselling that's not warranted
 
03:27:28.969 --> 03:27:28.979 align:start position:0%
however the administrative rule says
 
03:27:30.950 --> 03:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
that you know that the the pads have to
 
03:27:33.590 --> 03:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
meet that 232nd measurement so if they
 
03:27:35.150 --> 03:27:35.160 align:start position:0%
are found to be greater than the
 
03:27:36.830 --> 03:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
violation is the fact that the mechanic
 
03:27:38.809 --> 03:27:38.819 align:start position:0%
performed an improper inspection and
 
03:27:39.710 --> 03:27:39.720 align:start position:0%
that's how we would hold them
 
03:27:39.720 --> 03:27:42.110 align:start position:0%
that's how we would hold them
accountable

03:27:42.110 --> 03:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
accountable
 
03:27:42.120 --> 03:27:44.150 align:start position:0%
accountable
mm-hmm

03:27:44.150 --> 03:27:44.160 align:start position:0%
mm-hmm
 
03:27:46.910 --> 03:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
that represents thanks
 
03:27:49.010 --> 03:27:49.020 align:start position:0%
um just
 
03:27:51.830 --> 03:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
um when we have uh our subsequent
 
03:27:53.870 --> 03:27:53.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting and as we discuss
 
03:27:55.969 --> 03:27:55.979 align:start position:0%
some of these changes that we're looking
 
03:27:58.969 --> 03:27:58.979 align:start position:0%
at that you know I I want to make sure
 
03:28:02.170 --> 03:28:02.180 align:start position:0%
that we are mindful of
 
03:28:05.210 --> 03:28:05.220 align:start position:0%
nades requirements so that we don't run
 
03:28:06.469 --> 03:28:06.479 align:start position:0%
a foul of
 
03:28:09.050 --> 03:28:09.060 align:start position:0%
any environmental things from you know
 
03:28:11.750 --> 03:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
for air quality Etc
 
03:28:14.870 --> 03:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
and maybe the Des Department can
 
03:28:16.370 --> 03:28:16.380 align:start position:0%
continue to attend
 
03:28:19.130 --> 03:28:19.140 align:start position:0%
and make sure that we you know we we pay
 
03:28:20.510 --> 03:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
attention to those things because that
 
03:28:23.450 --> 03:28:23.460 align:start position:0%
is a thorny issue for air quality and
 
03:28:24.889 --> 03:28:24.899 align:start position:0%
you know and I know Motor Vehicles
 
03:28:26.450 --> 03:28:26.460 align:start position:0%
provide uh
 
03:28:29.389 --> 03:28:29.399 align:start position:0%
contribute to oversized amount towards
 
03:28:33.170 --> 03:28:33.180 align:start position:0%
our air quality issues in the state
 
03:28:36.170 --> 03:28:36.180 align:start position:0%
yeah again I said I was up to lighting
 
03:28:36.180 --> 03:28:37.690 align:start position:0%
yeah again I said I was up to lighting
um

03:28:37.690 --> 03:28:37.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:28:40.190 --> 03:28:40.200 align:start position:0%
but it's past emissions but I don't know
 
03:28:41.510 --> 03:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
if it was in there and that's not my
 
03:28:43.670 --> 03:28:43.680 align:start position:0%
intention at this point uh to go through
 
03:28:45.170 --> 03:28:45.180 align:start position:0%
these rules and we're just looking at
 
03:28:50.750 --> 03:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:53.330 --> 03:28:53.340 align:start position:0%
no no okay
 
03:28:55.550 --> 03:28:55.560 align:start position:0%
any other questions for Department of
 
03:28:58.250 --> 03:28:58.260 align:start position:0%
Safety I I think we can probably get
 
03:29:00.349 --> 03:29:00.359 align:start position:0%
gather a lot more in between this
 
03:29:02.929 --> 03:29:02.939 align:start position:0%
meeting and the next uh in terms of that
 
03:29:06.290 --> 03:29:06.300 align:start position:0%
issue the process and and obviously the
 
03:29:08.630 --> 03:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
complaints we won't know it's a very
 
03:29:09.889 --> 03:29:09.899 align:start position:0%
good point that if they're going in a
 
03:29:12.110 --> 03:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
number of different places we'll we
 
03:29:14.630 --> 03:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
can't get the data right now so
 
03:29:16.250 --> 03:29:16.260 align:start position:0%
um I I still think we should move
 
03:29:19.849 --> 03:29:19.859 align:start position:0%
forward with this uh with this direction
 
03:29:21.229 --> 03:29:21.239 align:start position:0%
yeah go ahead
 
03:29:23.510 --> 03:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm less concerned with thresholds
 
03:29:25.550 --> 03:29:25.560 align:start position:0%
on the data because what is likely
 
03:29:28.429 --> 03:29:28.439 align:start position:0%
happening with a lot of people is they
 
03:29:30.229 --> 03:29:30.239 align:start position:0%
have now had the worst day of their life
 
03:29:32.870 --> 03:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
because they have an old cheap car the
 
03:29:34.550 --> 03:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
repairs May equal the value of the car
 
03:29:36.050 --> 03:29:36.060 align:start position:0%
and they still have to get to work next
 
03:29:37.610 --> 03:29:37.620 align:start position:0%
week I don't think they're worried about
 
03:29:39.469 --> 03:29:39.479 align:start position:0%
complaining about the shop as much as
 
03:29:40.849 --> 03:29:40.859 align:start position:0%
they are figuring out how to get the
 
03:29:40.859 --> 03:29:42.229 align:start position:0%
they are figuring out how to get the
money

03:29:42.229 --> 03:29:42.239 align:start position:0%
money
 
03:29:44.510 --> 03:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
if it happens to one person it's too
 
03:29:46.849 --> 03:29:46.859 align:start position:0%
many for me so you know and we know
 
03:29:48.349 --> 03:29:48.359 align:start position:0%
what's going on
 
03:29:52.250 --> 03:29:52.260 align:start position:0%
I agree again I I see no need to cease
 
03:29:53.929 --> 03:29:53.939 align:start position:0%
what we're doing uh based on the lack of
 
03:29:55.190 --> 03:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
data for sure
 
03:29:56.630 --> 03:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
uh any other questions for these two
 
03:29:56.640 --> 03:29:58.010 align:start position:0%
uh any other questions for these two
gentlemen

03:29:58.010 --> 03:29:58.020 align:start position:0%
gentlemen
 
03:29:59.450 --> 03:29:59.460 align:start position:0%
seeing none thanks very much I'm sure
 
03:30:01.969 --> 03:30:01.979 align:start position:0%
we'll be talking in the interim
 
03:30:05.210 --> 03:30:05.220 align:start position:0%
anybody else wish to chime in while
 
03:30:06.889 --> 03:30:06.899 align:start position:0%
we're here this could be a very brief
 
03:30:08.389 --> 03:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
meeting which it's okay
 
03:30:19.070 --> 03:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:21.650 --> 03:30:21.660 align:start position:0%
is that on or off Becky older Department
 
03:30:23.269 --> 03:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
of Environmental Services and I just
 
03:30:25.190 --> 03:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
would like to say thank you for making
 
03:30:27.530 --> 03:30:27.540 align:start position:0%
it clear that that the intention is not
 
03:30:31.070 --> 03:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
to remove the requirement for the OBD
 
03:30:32.990 --> 03:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
inspection overall and Des will
 
03:30:35.150 --> 03:30:35.160 align:start position:0%
certainly make make a point of being in
 
03:30:37.370 --> 03:30:37.380 align:start position:0%
other hearings thank you
 
03:30:39.530 --> 03:30:39.540 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:30:42.469 --> 03:30:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:44.389 --> 03:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
all right this is going to be a lot
 
03:30:46.910 --> 03:30:46.920 align:start position:0%
easier than I thought it was going to be
 
03:31:04.090 --> 03:31:04.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:07.870 --> 03:31:07.880 align:start position:0%
a bigger topic too on
 
03:31:11.570 --> 03:31:11.580 align:start position:0%
inspection station education uh one that
 
03:31:13.130 --> 03:31:13.140 align:start position:0%
came up for me and it was actually a
 
03:31:15.349 --> 03:31:15.359 align:start position:0%
couple of people so when you look at
 
03:31:17.210 --> 03:31:17.220 align:start position:0%
your car and you look at the bumper no
 
03:31:19.130 --> 03:31:19.140 align:start position:0%
you don't you can't see the bumper you
 
03:31:20.809 --> 03:31:20.819 align:start position:0%
see a giant piece of cosmetic plastic
 
03:31:23.090 --> 03:31:23.100 align:start position:0%
that adds almost no structural value to
 
03:31:25.490 --> 03:31:25.500 align:start position:0%
the car at all the Bumper's behind it
 
03:31:28.849 --> 03:31:28.859 align:start position:0%
so if those are cracked that we had some
 
03:31:31.910 --> 03:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
shops that were failing the car for a
 
03:31:33.830 --> 03:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
pretty piece essentially you rip the
 
03:31:35.330 --> 03:31:35.340 align:start position:0%
thing off the car's still just as safe
 
03:31:36.889 --> 03:31:36.899 align:start position:0%
as it was
 
03:31:39.769 --> 03:31:39.779 align:start position:0%
turns out that wasn't the Department's
 
03:31:42.830 --> 03:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
intent it was if it's busted to the
 
03:31:44.690 --> 03:31:44.700 align:start position:0%
point that it could fall off it's got
 
03:31:46.550 --> 03:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
pieces sticking out or something fine
 
03:31:50.330 --> 03:31:50.340 align:start position:0%
but a simple crack no and what I did was
 
03:31:52.910 --> 03:31:52.920 align:start position:0%
I had somebody from DMV call the shop
 
03:31:55.670 --> 03:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
and tell them to stop doing that
 
03:31:57.769 --> 03:31:57.779 align:start position:0%
it's one shop can't do that for every
 
03:31:59.690 --> 03:31:59.700 align:start position:0%
shop so I don't know what the answer is
 
03:32:01.309 --> 03:32:01.319 align:start position:0%
we need a better method when they're
 
03:32:03.410 --> 03:32:03.420 align:start position:0%
misinterpreting what it is that we want
 
03:32:05.929 --> 03:32:05.939 align:start position:0%
them to do so I think the rule
 
03:32:08.269 --> 03:32:08.279 align:start position:0%
referenced initially just damaged bumper
 
03:32:10.190 --> 03:32:10.200 align:start position:0%
cover that should never have been a rule
 
03:32:11.750 --> 03:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter if it's damaged it
 
03:32:13.429 --> 03:32:13.439 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter if your rocker panels are
 
03:32:15.889 --> 03:32:15.899 align:start position:0%
damaged they're pretty pieces
 
03:32:18.229 --> 03:32:18.239 align:start position:0%
um what someone who is creative with
 
03:32:20.750 --> 03:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
older Jeeps figured out was they got
 
03:32:22.610 --> 03:32:22.620 align:start position:0%
failed for Rusty rocker panels so they
 
03:32:23.570 --> 03:32:23.580 align:start position:0%
cut them off
 
03:32:26.750 --> 03:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
and now the vehicle is fine because what
 
03:32:28.790 --> 03:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
was left under the rocker panel was
 
03:32:30.830 --> 03:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
solid structural metal that does not
 
03:32:32.570 --> 03:32:32.580 align:start position:0%
allow exhaust gas to get into the cabin
 
03:32:34.610 --> 03:32:34.620 align:start position:0%
of the vehicle and we don't want people
 
03:32:36.590 --> 03:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
getting a Sawzall so that they can pass
 
03:32:39.769 --> 03:32:39.779 align:start position:0%
an inspection so I don't I don't know
 
03:32:41.929 --> 03:32:41.939 align:start position:0%
what the bigger um so that's the bigger
 
03:32:43.190 --> 03:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
topic and I don't know what the bigger
 
03:32:45.889 --> 03:32:45.899 align:start position:0%
answer is but in general shops
 
03:32:47.630 --> 03:32:47.640 align:start position:0%
misinterpreting rules are taking them to
 
03:32:49.130 --> 03:32:49.140 align:start position:0%
the nth degree when we don't want them
 
03:32:51.590 --> 03:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
to that's a culture we need to change I
 
03:32:53.090 --> 03:32:53.100 align:start position:0%
don't know where it's coming from but
 
03:32:57.769 --> 03:32:57.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:00.429 --> 03:33:00.439 align:start position:0%
thank you sir go George
 
03:33:02.330 --> 03:33:02.340 align:start position:0%
all right well nothing else to
 
03:33:04.309 --> 03:33:04.319 align:start position:0%
contribute today again
 
03:33:06.410 --> 03:33:06.420 align:start position:0%
um we're going to continue independently
 
03:33:08.870 --> 03:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
to go through the rules next meeting we
 
03:33:10.250 --> 03:33:10.260 align:start position:0%
will have a revised list of the ones
 
03:33:12.830 --> 03:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
that we want to address by definition uh
 
03:33:14.269 --> 03:33:14.279 align:start position:0%
in the meantime we'll have conversations
 
03:33:16.370 --> 03:33:16.380 align:start position:0%
with safety and Department of Motor
 
03:33:18.889 --> 03:33:18.899 align:start position:0%
Vehicles in terms of nailing down
 
03:33:23.330 --> 03:33:23.340 align:start position:0%
language on the the the process and
 
03:33:25.729 --> 03:33:25.739 align:start position:0%
possibly punishment if you will use that
 
03:33:28.250 --> 03:33:28.260 align:start position:0%
word and see if that needs to go into
 
03:33:30.290 --> 03:33:30.300 align:start position:0%
statute or if it's sufficient in rules
 
03:33:31.849 --> 03:33:31.859 align:start position:0%
we can we can we'll have more
 
03:33:33.349 --> 03:33:33.359 align:start position:0%
information on that
 
03:33:35.330 --> 03:33:35.340 align:start position:0%
and I think we've already agreed we'll
 
03:33:38.290 --> 03:33:38.300 align:start position:0%
we'll leave
 
03:33:41.210 --> 03:33:41.220 align:start position:0%
uh the first year exemption to a
 
03:33:43.610 --> 03:33:43.620 align:start position:0%
different bill so if there's nobody else
 
03:33:46.490 --> 03:33:46.500 align:start position:0%
there's nobody here
 
03:33:47.690 --> 03:33:47.700 align:start position:0%
um nobody else
 
03:33:50.870 --> 03:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative Smith I had a
 
03:33:52.370 --> 03:33:52.380 align:start position:0%
question while we have the department of
 
03:33:54.889 --> 03:33:54.899 align:start position:0%
safety here I see a lot of cars with
 
03:33:57.170 --> 03:33:57.180 align:start position:0%
blue headlights
 
03:34:00.950 --> 03:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:04.429 --> 03:34:04.439 align:start position:0%
a lot of cars with blue headlights and
 
03:34:07.130 --> 03:34:07.140 align:start position:0%
then another common thing on four models
 
03:34:08.630 --> 03:34:08.640 align:start position:0%
that I know of is a colored ring around
 
03:34:11.030 --> 03:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
the headlight and those can be red blue
 
03:34:12.889 --> 03:34:12.899 align:start position:0%
green those are the three I've seen I
 
03:34:14.690 --> 03:34:14.700 align:start position:0%
think there's more so they're on the
 
03:34:16.130 --> 03:34:16.140 align:start position:0%
front of the car right around the
 
03:34:20.210 --> 03:34:20.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:22.250 --> 03:34:22.260 align:start position:0%
thank you those are called those are
 
03:34:24.710 --> 03:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
called Halos yeah and there is a
 
03:34:26.030 --> 03:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
lighting build that's also been
 
03:34:28.250 --> 03:34:28.260 align:start position:0%
introduced by Yours Truly for the
 
03:34:30.650 --> 03:34:30.660 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety so I think we have
 
03:34:33.250 --> 03:34:33.260 align:start position:0%
a vehicle to attach any other questions
 
03:34:37.190 --> 03:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:39.590 --> 03:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
what's up I said nice Wick and annoying
 
03:34:41.590 --> 03:34:41.600 align:start position:0%
glad we're getting that done
 
03:34:44.330 --> 03:34:44.340 align:start position:0%
lumens too they seem to be getting
 
03:34:47.750 --> 03:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
brighter and brighter by the day yeah so
 
03:34:49.969 --> 03:34:49.979 align:start position:0%
if nothing else I'll look during the
 
03:34:59.929 --> 03:34:59.939 align:start position:0%
