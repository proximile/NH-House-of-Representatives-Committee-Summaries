me
 
00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:20.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:23.759 align:start position:0%
is in second rendition first submitted
 
00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:27.180 align:start position:0%
last year the goal is to reduce the
 
00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:29.039 align:start position:0%
amount of unemployment benefits someone
 
00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:30.770 align:start position:0%
amount of unemployment benefits someone
receives

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:30.780 align:start position:0%
receives
 
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
based on the unemployment rate
 
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
this was based off of
 
00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
another state that was successful
 
00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:40.139 align:start position:0%
utilizing this
 
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:41.880 align:start position:0%
but I think it's been very clear to all
 
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
of us it would not be successful I see
 
00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:46.860 align:start position:0%
you Josh can you put your hand down
 
00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:49.080 align:start position:0%
it's very sick this is not
 
00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:51.419 align:start position:0%
uh something that would work here
 
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:54.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:57.660 align:start position:0%
um or any number of reasons
 
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:00.360 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire does better than the
 
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
state that enacted it on almost every
 
00:07:05.809 --> 00:07:05.819 align:start position:0%
parameter and every uh everything worth
 
00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:09.660 align:start position:0%
of calculating
 
00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:11.210 align:start position:0%
of calculating
the

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:11.220 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:13.129 align:start position:0%
the
sponsor

00:07:13.129 --> 00:07:13.139 align:start position:0%
sponsor
 
00:07:15.409 --> 00:07:15.419 align:start position:0%
understands that
 
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
however does have a concern
 
00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:20.220 align:start position:0%
that there are a number of people
 
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
staying on unemployment through the
 
00:07:24.409 --> 00:07:24.419 align:start position:0%
first 26 weeks
 
00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
uh through the for through all the 26
 
00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.909 align:start position:0%
uh through the for through all the 26
weeks

00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:28.919 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:30.660 align:start position:0%
and would like to
 
00:07:34.129 --> 00:07:34.139 align:start position:0%
make a significant change to the bill I
 
00:07:35.689 --> 00:07:35.699 align:start position:0%
have spoken
 
00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:37.919 align:start position:0%
at length with this uh with the
 
00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:40.380 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner lovers about what
 
00:07:43.969 --> 00:07:43.979 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
um that he sees around the country
 
00:07:50.809 --> 00:07:50.819 align:start position:0%
that we might be able to step up
 
00:07:50.819 --> 00:07:52.370 align:start position:0%
that we might be able to step up
um

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:52.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:54.529 --> 00:07:54.539 align:start position:0%
not only not just for the purpose of
 
00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:57.180 align:start position:0%
getting people off but getting them a
 
00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:04.909 --> 00:08:04.919 align:start position:0%
um he understands what my goal is and um
 
00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
that is why I'm asking you to retain it
 
00:08:11.749 --> 00:08:11.759 align:start position:0%
and I'll say it a second time
 
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
in front of people
 
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:17.460 align:start position:0%
on record in front of the cameras
 
00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
that is not the intent to bring this
 
00:08:23.869 --> 00:08:23.879 align:start position:0%
bill back in any in its same form where
 
00:08:27.529 --> 00:08:27.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:31.740 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefit weeks based on
 
00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:34.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:37.740 align:start position:0%
percentage on on the uh unemployment
 
00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:38.810 align:start position:0%
percentage on on the uh unemployment
rate

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:38.820 align:start position:0%
rate
 
00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:40.620 align:start position:0%
that's why I've asked the retention
 
00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:43.620 align:start position:0%
representative attitude
 
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'm going to
 
00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:46.620 align:start position:0%
oppose retention
 
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:49.800 align:start position:0%
um because I believe itl is a more
 
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate motion and beyond that I
 
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
think indefinite postponement is a more
 
00:08:54.829 --> 00:08:54.839 align:start position:0%
appropriate emotion and the only reason
 
00:08:56.269 --> 00:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
I stop at indefinite postponement
 
00:08:57.530 --> 00:08:57.540 align:start position:0%
because there isn't a higher means to
 
00:08:59.269 --> 00:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
kill this film
 
00:08:59.279 --> 00:08:59.930 align:start position:0%
kill this film
um

00:08:59.930 --> 00:08:59.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:03.240 align:start position:0%
I have never seen uh the employment
 
00:09:05.949 --> 00:09:05.959 align:start position:0%
security folks give such a passionate
 
00:09:09.889 --> 00:09:09.899 align:start position:0%
and thorough defense of an already well
 
00:09:09.899 --> 00:09:11.470 align:start position:0%
and thorough defense of an already well
functioning

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:11.480 align:start position:0%
functioning
 
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
unemployment system than they did when
 
00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:16.380 align:start position:0%
this bill was introduced as we said for
 
00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:17.700 align:start position:0%
the second time
 
00:09:20.509 --> 00:09:20.519 align:start position:0%
this bill relies on a philosophy that
 
00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:22.980 align:start position:0%
the biggest issue that we faced during
 
00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:25.260 align:start position:0%
the last two years and the covid
 
00:09:27.949 --> 00:09:27.959 align:start position:0%
pandemic was that in the middle of the
 
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
biggest Health crisis that this country
 
00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:31.620 align:start position:0%
has faced in over a hundred years that
 
00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:33.300 align:start position:0%
the real problem was that people just
 
00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:36.360 align:start position:0%
had it too good with unemployment and
 
00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:37.640 align:start position:0%
that was the argument that we heard
 
00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
breathlessly two years ago when it was
 
00:09:42.889 --> 00:09:42.899 align:start position:0%
lobbied that we reduce extended
 
00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:45.300 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits uh in the state of
 
00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:48.060 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire did in June of 2021 uh and
 
00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:51.420 align:start position:0%
since that time we have not seen the
 
00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
kind of major filling of job vacancies
 
00:09:58.130 --> 00:09:58.140 align:start position:0%
that was projected to happen we all saw
 
00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
the story the other week where due to
 
00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:03.240 align:start position:0%
these significant Staffing shortages
 
00:10:05.389 --> 00:10:05.399 align:start position:0%
to the state prison uh the National
 
00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
Guard now has to come in and fill spots
 
00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:10.860 align:start position:0%
as an employee of the Dartmouth Health
 
00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:13.740 align:start position:0%
Network I can say that reducing those
 
00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:15.420 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits did not change the
 
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
fact that our nursing stations
 
00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:20.700 align:start position:0%
have about 150 slots to fill a week and
 
00:10:23.329 --> 00:10:23.339 align:start position:0%
have about 80 people's Worth to do it
 
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
um these sectors are still woefully
 
00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:29.580 align:start position:0%
um undone even with that rollback and
 
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
extended unemployment I don't think this
 
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
is going to do anything different
 
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:36.240 align:start position:0%
um I would really like to see
 
00:10:38.389 --> 00:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
um this bill meet its end on the floor
 
00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:45.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:47.949 --> 00:10:47.959 align:start position:0%
representative Cahill
 
00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I I agree with you
 
00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:52.380 align:start position:0%
that this is not necessary for New
 
00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:55.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I question what the other
 
00:10:57.829 --> 00:10:57.839 align:start position:0%
bill that the representative from
 
00:10:59.569 --> 00:10:59.579 align:start position:0%
Barrington is thinking about certainly
 
00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
it sounds like it's a different bill so
 
00:11:04.509 --> 00:11:04.519 align:start position:0%
he would be free to introduce that bill
 
00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
for next year
 
00:11:18.829 --> 00:11:18.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:23.870 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:27.009 --> 00:11:27.019 align:start position:0%
I'm going to vote Yes on retain
 
00:11:30.889 --> 00:11:30.899 align:start position:0%
I told you Mr chair that I would do that
 
00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:34.140 align:start position:0%
um I do not agree with anyone who's said
 
00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
that this is a horrible bill in its
 
00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839 align:start position:0%
present form if we get another bill that
 
00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:44.100 align:start position:0%
is anywhere near as bad as this one
 
00:11:46.009 --> 00:11:46.019 align:start position:0%
um I will see to it that that bill goes
 
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
down uh next year but uh
 
00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:52.260 align:start position:0%
um I just want to be clear that um when
 
00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:55.260 align:start position:0%
I record my vote Yes it's not because I
 
00:11:56.509 --> 00:11:56.519 align:start position:0%
think this bill
 
00:11:59.750 --> 00:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
um is in any way attractive or that we
 
00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:01.980 align:start position:0%
necessarily need any bill
 
00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:02.509 align:start position:0%
necessarily need any bill
um

00:12:02.509 --> 00:12:02.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:05.269 --> 00:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
because I think uh Deputy Commissioner
 
00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:07.980 align:start position:0%
labors did an excellent job of showing
 
00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:10.740 align:start position:0%
um how well our unemployment system is
 
00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
working now
 
00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:15.180 align:start position:0%
so um but but you will have my vote Mr
 
00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:16.930 align:start position:0%
so um but but you will have my vote Mr
chair

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:16.940 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:18.710 align:start position:0%
chair
worth

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
worth
 
00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:22.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I was not part
 
00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:24.140 align:start position:0%
of the discussions that you had about
 
00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:26.700 align:start position:0%
maybe some appropriate changes to this
 
00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:29.240 align:start position:0%
bill something that came to my mind
 
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
certainly I'm very proud of the
 
00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:37.260 align:start position:0%
um impact that our unemployment system
 
00:12:40.069 --> 00:12:40.079 align:start position:0%
has in New Hampshire
 
00:12:42.769 --> 00:12:42.779 align:start position:0%
I think it's working very well the the
 
00:12:45.829 --> 00:12:45.839 align:start position:0%
statistics show that I don't think we
 
00:12:47.329 --> 00:12:47.339 align:start position:0%
can sit here and say Well it must be
 
00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:49.200 align:start position:0%
perfect then
 
00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:51.660 align:start position:0%
when I listened to the testimony on this
 
00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:54.540 align:start position:0%
bill there was the sponsor brought up
 
00:12:58.430 --> 00:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
just one person it was an example of
 
00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
an employee that is off seasonally and
 
00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:04.740 align:start position:0%
is off seasonally every year and it
 
00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:06.660 align:start position:0%
sounded from the story for a significant
 
00:13:09.949 --> 00:13:09.959 align:start position:0%
amount of time after that I spoke to the
 
00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:11.420 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner
 
00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:14.940 align:start position:0%
and he explained to me that there are in
 
00:13:19.129 --> 00:13:19.139 align:start position:0%
fact certain employers that never pay
 
00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:22.380 align:start position:0%
into the system as much as they end up
 
00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:25.500 align:start position:0%
having their employees take out
 
00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
so for me that was one example of
 
00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:32.700 align:start position:0%
um maybe a problem that was addressed
 
00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:36.060 align:start position:0%
addressed by the sponsor and there may
 
00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
be a solution that would have bipartisan
 
00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.030 align:start position:0%
be a solution that would have bipartisan
support

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:40.040 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:13:43.009 --> 00:13:43.019 align:start position:0%
so that's why I'm supporting the chair
 
00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:45.180 align:start position:0%
in his effort to
 
00:13:47.569 --> 00:13:47.579 align:start position:0%
retain this bill and use that as a
 
00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:49.380 align:start position:0%
vehicle to do a little more work on this
 
00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:56.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:58.610 --> 00:13:58.620 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie thank you Mr
 
00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:01.129 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie thank you Mr
chairman

00:14:01.129 --> 00:14:01.139 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:14:01.139 --> 00:14:02.030 align:start position:0%
chairman
um

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:04.069 --> 00:14:04.079 align:start position:0%
I served on the unemployment advisory
 
00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:06.180 align:start position:0%
committee for many years as as you do
 
00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:07.790 align:start position:0%
committee for many years as as you do
currently

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:14:09.889 --> 00:14:09.899 align:start position:0%
there were a lot of changes I think that
 
00:14:11.509 --> 00:14:11.519 align:start position:0%
we could make in the unemployment system
 
00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:15.300 align:start position:0%
and I would I would be more than happy
 
00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:18.060 align:start position:0%
to work on any bill that relates to that
 
00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
the problem I have with this legislation
 
00:14:23.629 --> 00:14:23.639 align:start position:0%
this particular bill is when I queried
 
00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:27.300 align:start position:0%
the sponsor of the bill as to who wrote
 
00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:29.100 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:14:31.069 --> 00:14:31.079 align:start position:0%
it was not written by anybody in New
 
00:14:32.569 --> 00:14:32.579 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it was written by a National
 
00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
Organization who has no particular
 
00:14:36.949 --> 00:14:36.959 align:start position:0%
interests in improving the benefits of
 
00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:38.700 align:start position:0%
the unemployed workers in the state of
 
00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:39.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:14:42.769 --> 00:14:42.779 align:start position:0%
and therefore I I think if it is uh
 
00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
we're waiting for another version from
 
00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
the same organization who produces
 
00:14:50.449 --> 00:14:50.459 align:start position:0%
um that's somewhat troubling to me
 
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
but that said I think we need to we need
 
00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
uh we need to work on the unemployment
 
00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:57.180 align:start position:0%
system the benefits could be improved
 
00:14:59.350 --> 00:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
they haven't been for a number of years
 
00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:01.740 align:start position:0%
uh and there are other things we may be
 
00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
able to do but I don't see necessarily
 
00:15:06.949 --> 00:15:06.959 align:start position:0%
listens as a vehicle to do that and I
 
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
would uh and I will vote against uh any
 
00:15:14.269 --> 00:15:14.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:14.279 --> 00:15:16.610 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:16.620 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:21.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:23.269 --> 00:15:23.279 align:start position:0%
we have a motion on the floor
 
00:15:26.269 --> 00:15:26.279 align:start position:0%
to retain house bill 190.
 
00:15:27.949 --> 00:15:27.959 align:start position:0%

right so I thought it was my apologies

thank you
 
00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:49.020 align:start position:0%
um this um this bill is uh intended to
 
00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:51.720 align:start position:0%
replace the uh New Hampshire Department
 
00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:54.660 align:start position:0%
of Labor's health and safety standards
 
00:18:57.230 --> 00:18:57.240 align:start position:0%
with the OSHA standards
 
00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
um numbered uh 1910.
 
00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:02.029 align:start position:0%
um numbered uh 1910.
um

00:19:02.029 --> 00:19:02.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:04.200 align:start position:0%
the uh we
 
00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:05.630 align:start position:0%
the uh we
heard

00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:05.640 align:start position:0%
heard
 
00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:06.529 align:start position:0%
heard
um

00:19:06.529 --> 00:19:06.539 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:10.200 align:start position:0%
testimony and during our subcommittee
 
00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:13.140 align:start position:0%
meetings that there were
 
00:19:16.669 --> 00:19:16.679 align:start position:0%
various uh organizations and groups that
 
00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:19.260 align:start position:0%
really wanted to weigh in and do some
 
00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
more direct comparisons as to uh
 
00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:26.700 align:start position:0%
what the two standards are um the
 
00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:28.200 align:start position:0%
department of labor standards and the
 
00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:31.860 align:start position:0%
OSHA standards are so um out of
 
00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:33.660 align:start position:0%
deference to them they did not have a
 
00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:35.720 align:start position:0%
chance during our
 
00:19:40.669 --> 00:19:40.679 align:start position:0%
study committee to uh to weigh in and I
 
00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:42.360 align:start position:0%
think the subcommittee felt it was
 
00:19:45.169 --> 00:19:45.179 align:start position:0%
vulnerably reasonable for us to continue
 
00:19:45.179 --> 00:19:46.250 align:start position:0%
vulnerably reasonable for us to continue
to

00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:46.260 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:49.500 align:start position:0%
um meet on a retained bill
 
00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:51.780 align:start position:0%
um and get those folks an opportunity to
 
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
do the work that they wanted to do so
 
00:19:57.669 --> 00:19:57.679 align:start position:0%
for that reason the subcommittee
 
00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:00.780 align:start position:0%
decided unanimously that retaining the
 
00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
bill was the right course of action to
 
00:20:06.169 --> 00:20:06.179 align:start position:0%
take and my
 
00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
hopes and expectations are that we will
 
00:20:12.049 --> 00:20:12.059 align:start position:0%
continue to work on this in come January
 
00:20:15.289 --> 00:20:15.299 align:start position:0%
of next year we'll have a vote on this

there's a lot of work that went into
 
00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
this bill over the last couple years
 
00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
I think it's a good bill
 
00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
um but I agree that you know there are
 
00:20:45.529 --> 00:20:45.539 align:start position:0%
some tweaks that need to be made and
 
00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
give people time so I think it's a good
 
00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:56.280 align:start position:0%

speak to your Amendment thank you
 
00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:22.980 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman as you know excuse me I'm
 
00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
not comfortable with the bill the way it
 
00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:26.220 align:start position:0%
is I'm trying to submit
 
00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:28.860 align:start position:0%
some amendments
 
00:32:32.090 --> 00:32:32.100 align:start position:0%
that I feel are appropriate
 
00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
in the testimony that was provided
 
00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:40.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:43.380 align:start position:0%
the firefighters volunteer firefighters
 
00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:45.720 align:start position:0%
should have
 
00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:47.940 align:start position:0%
um the right
 
00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:50.580 align:start position:0%
that is already given to members of the
 
00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
uh ambulance and EMT
 
00:33:12.769 --> 00:33:12.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:17.940 align:start position:0%
section excuse me in RSA 153 a17.
 
00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:20.220 align:start position:0%
and if you read
 
00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:26.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:30.549 --> 00:33:30.559 align:start position:0%
what this bill says at all
 
00:33:30.559 --> 00:33:32.149 align:start position:0%
what this bill says at all
so

00:33:32.149 --> 00:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
what I've done is I copied it
 
00:33:39.769 --> 00:33:39.779 align:start position:0%
pretty much line for line word for word
 
00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
but instead of having
 
00:33:45.370 --> 00:33:45.380 align:start position:0%
just emergency medical workers it
 
00:33:49.009 --> 00:33:49.019 align:start position:0%
includes volunteer firefighters
 
00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
and it states that no volunteer
 
00:33:53.149 --> 00:33:53.159 align:start position:0%
firefighter was in good faith attempts
 
00:33:55.370 --> 00:33:55.380 align:start position:0%
to render firefighting and emergency
 
00:33:57.169 --> 00:33:57.179 align:start position:0%
service on their way on the route to an
 
00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
employment they will not receive any
 
00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:01.740 align:start position:0%
form of reprimander penalty as a result
 
00:34:04.009 --> 00:34:04.019 align:start position:0%
of their of this
 
00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:07.500 align:start position:0%
so if you truly want to give
 
00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:09.419 align:start position:0%
the same right to the father of
 
00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
firefighters is already in law
 
00:34:15.889 --> 00:34:15.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:23.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:26.089 --> 00:34:26.099 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
00:34:29.149 --> 00:34:29.159 align:start position:0%
representative adjectives
 
00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:31.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I will be
 
00:34:33.109 --> 00:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
opposing this amendment
 
00:34:35.149 --> 00:34:35.159 align:start position:0%
um for a few reasons
 
00:34:35.159 --> 00:34:35.869 align:start position:0%
um for a few reasons
um

00:34:35.869 --> 00:34:35.879 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:37.919 align:start position:0%
while I appreciate the effort to copy
 
00:34:39.889 --> 00:34:39.899 align:start position:0%
the EMT statute what that says to me is
 
00:34:42.649 --> 00:34:42.659 align:start position:0%
that we need to expand the EMT statute
 
00:34:42.659 --> 00:34:43.550 align:start position:0%
that we need to expand the EMT statute
um

00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
three uh zero zero excuse me zero nine
 
00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:49.560 align:start position:0%
nine zero H
 
00:34:52.970 --> 00:34:52.980 align:start position:0%
um only pertains to a volunteer
 
00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
firefighter who
 
00:34:58.010 --> 00:34:58.020 align:start position:0%
hopefully the emergency happens while
 
00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
they're on their way to work
 
00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:02.220 align:start position:0%
um otherwise there's no protection
 
00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:04.200 align:start position:0%
extended to them
 
00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:05.270 align:start position:0%
extended to them
um

00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh there are a lot of small towns in the
 
00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire that rely on
 
00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
their volunteer firefighting Force
 
00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:11.089 align:start position:0%
their volunteer firefighting Force
um

00:35:11.089 --> 00:35:11.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
I would prefer that volunteer
 
00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:14.820 align:start position:0%
firefighters got paid I think it's very
 
00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:16.380 align:start position:0%
hard and dangerous work that they do
 
00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:18.660 align:start position:0%
that potentially has a lot of long-term
 
00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:21.240 align:start position:0%
Health consequences the original bill as
 
00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:24.180 align:start position:0%
written for me is the compromise
 
00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:24.890 align:start position:0%
written for me is the compromise
um

00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:24.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:29.160 align:start position:0%
I I I I really think that you know if it
 
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
was your house or the house of somebody
 
00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
that you cared about uh that burned down
 
00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
in the middle of a work day and somebody
 
00:35:37.310 --> 00:35:37.320 align:start position:0%
couldn't get there because they were
 
00:35:39.829 --> 00:35:39.839 align:start position:0%
stuck at Walmart because they're um
 
00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
shift lead wouldn't let them off you'd
 
00:35:43.490 --> 00:35:43.500 align:start position:0%
feel really pretty rubbed raw by that
 
00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:46.200 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic I actually uh did
 
00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
senior in-home caretaking for two
 
00:35:52.490 --> 00:35:52.500 align:start position:0%
individuals uh who one was very
 
00:35:54.050 --> 00:35:54.060 align:start position:0%
cognitively disabled the other one was
 
00:35:56.089 --> 00:35:56.099 align:start position:0%
very physically disabled and if a fire
 
00:35:57.710 --> 00:35:57.720 align:start position:0%
had occurred
 
00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
um at a moment where somebody wasn't
 
00:36:02.050 --> 00:36:02.060 align:start position:0%
immediately in the area to get them out
 
00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:04.020 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't have made it out of that
 
00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:05.329 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't have made it out of that
building

00:36:05.329 --> 00:36:05.339 align:start position:0%
building
 
00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:08.640 align:start position:0%
um and it haunts me to think uh
 
00:36:10.910 --> 00:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
something like that happening because an
 
00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:13.260 align:start position:0%
employee is stuck at work uh this bill
 
00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:16.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't deal with that so for that
 
00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
reason on top of the fact that
 
00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:21.660 align:start position:0%
as representative Sullivan alluded to in
 
00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:23.700 align:start position:0%
earlier conversations
 
00:36:27.290 --> 00:36:27.300 align:start position:0%
um this still allows for some discipline
 
00:36:30.010 --> 00:36:30.020 align:start position:0%
um I'm very concerned with that
 
00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:32.700 align:start position:0%
my goal with this legislation is to
 
00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
extend these same protections to
 
00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:37.460 align:start position:0%
volunteer firefighters and EMS workers
 
00:36:39.890 --> 00:36:39.900 align:start position:0%
that are granted currently to our
 
00:36:42.530 --> 00:36:42.540 align:start position:0%
Reserve troops I think that's a fair
 
00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:44.640 align:start position:0%
standard and as such I will be opposing
 
00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:50.700 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:52.910 align:start position:0%
further discussion
representative

00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:36:54.829 --> 00:36:54.839 align:start position:0%
I would just like to ask for some
 
00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
clarification from the previous
 
00:36:59.089 --> 00:36:59.099 align:start position:0%
representative you said that volunteer
 
00:37:01.130 --> 00:37:01.140 align:start position:0%
firefighters do not get paid is that
 
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
correct did I understand you correctly
 
00:37:05.329 --> 00:37:05.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to speak for every single
 
00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:09.240 align:start position:0%
Department across the state of New
 
00:37:10.370 --> 00:37:10.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's my understanding that if
 
00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
they're volunteered they're not getting
 
00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:12.650 align:start position:0%
they're volunteered they're not getting
paid

00:37:12.650 --> 00:37:12.660 align:start position:0%
paid
 
00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:14.750 align:start position:0%
paid
um

00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:19.010 align:start position:0%
um
that's

00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:21.540 align:start position:0%
further further discussion uh
 
00:37:24.890 --> 00:37:24.900 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie well I just uh I
 
00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
don't have specific data on that but I
 
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
can tell you that uh the volunteer
 
00:37:30.589 --> 00:37:30.599 align:start position:0%
firefighters do get paid in many
 
00:37:30.599 --> 00:37:32.089 align:start position:0%
firefighters do get paid in many
communities

00:37:32.089 --> 00:37:32.099 align:start position:0%
communities
 
00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
um and they have a set amount of money
 
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
they get paid and they're also entitled
 
00:37:38.450 --> 00:37:38.460 align:start position:0%
to workers compensation as a result of
 
00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:46.020 align:start position:0%
thank you yes uh representative yeah I
 
00:37:48.890 --> 00:37:48.900 align:start position:0%
just want to clarify I I would I I would
 
00:37:50.690 --> 00:37:50.700 align:start position:0%
hope that that would not be the sticking
 
00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
point of my argument I'm happy to be
 
00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:54.720 align:start position:0%
wrong on that
 
00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
um but my point um there more broadly
 
00:38:01.609 --> 00:38:01.619 align:start position:0%
was I think this amendment to two
 
00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:03.180 align:start position:0%
Narrows down what is already a
 
00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
compromised position for me
 
00:38:09.290 --> 00:38:09.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:13.130 --> 00:38:13.140 align:start position:0%

so that motion to amend fails did I see
 
00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
you had another amendment you wanted to
 
00:39:39.349 --> 00:39:39.359 align:start position:0%
bring forth
 
00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I I bring forth

00:39:55.130 --> 00:39:55.140 align:start position:0%
the motion to amend has been made did
 
00:39:57.050 --> 00:39:57.060 align:start position:0%
you get that number I did
 
00:39:59.930 --> 00:39:59.940 align:start position:0%
zero nine is there a second second
 
00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
in a second about it
 
00:40:04.069 --> 00:40:04.079 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:40:07.250 --> 00:40:07.260 align:start position:0%
um would you do you wish to speak I wish
 
00:40:10.069 --> 00:40:10.079 align:start position:0%
please do the first one first amendment
 
00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
I was trying to make a point
 
00:40:15.109 --> 00:40:15.119 align:start position:0%
right because
 
00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:17.640 align:start position:0%
it was said time and time again that the
 
00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
firefighters uh volunteer firefighters
 
00:40:21.829 --> 00:40:21.839 align:start position:0%
deserve the same
 
00:40:25.010 --> 00:40:25.020 align:start position:0%
uh benefit that is given in law
 
00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:27.240 align:start position:0%
by the emergency medical
 
00:40:30.290 --> 00:40:30.300 align:start position:0%
folks so I made that point to do exactly
 
00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:31.740 align:start position:0%
what was said
 
00:40:33.829 --> 00:40:33.839 align:start position:0%
knowing full well
 
00:40:35.450 --> 00:40:35.460 align:start position:0%
it was not going to be enough but it's
 
00:40:37.730 --> 00:40:37.740 align:start position:0%
on the record that is exactly what was
 
00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
requested at least verbally
 
00:40:43.069 --> 00:40:43.079 align:start position:0%
this one is more of what I consider a
 
00:40:47.390 --> 00:40:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:50.569 --> 00:40:50.579 align:start position:0%
so what I did here is I made some
 
00:40:50.579 --> 00:40:53.329 align:start position:0%
so what I did here is I made some
changes

00:40:53.329 --> 00:40:53.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:56.810 --> 00:40:56.820 align:start position:0%
to both the the beginning part
 
00:40:59.089 --> 00:40:59.099 align:start position:0%
of the bill as well as out of the second
 
00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:06.890 --> 00:41:06.900 align:start position:0%
there is a belief that
 
00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:08.640 align:start position:0%
you shouldn't be able to be discharged
 
00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:10.200 align:start position:0%
or disciplined
 
00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:12.660 align:start position:0%
for certain actions
 
00:41:14.990 --> 00:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
and it seems to be pervasive and the
 
00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
reason why I will never ever give anyone
 
00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
a pass
 
00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
or discharge
 
00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:23.640 align:start position:0%
or reprimand goes back to
 
00:41:26.210 --> 00:41:26.220 align:start position:0%
10 years ago you can look this up while
 
00:41:27.770 --> 00:41:27.780 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about it
 
00:41:29.089 --> 00:41:29.099 align:start position:0%
when a University of New Hampshire
 
00:41:29.099 --> 00:41:30.829 align:start position:0%
when a University of New Hampshire
professor

00:41:30.829 --> 00:41:30.839 align:start position:0%
professor
 
00:41:33.109 --> 00:41:33.119 align:start position:0%
exposed himself to a 16 year old girl
 
00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:35.820 align:start position:0%
and her mother in a parking lot
 
00:41:38.569 --> 00:41:38.579 align:start position:0%
of a grocery store
 
00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
he was arrested
 
00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:43.310 align:start position:0%
he was arrested
fired

00:41:43.310 --> 00:41:43.320 align:start position:0%
fired
 
00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:45.060 align:start position:0%
and then received his job back with full
 
00:41:47.450 --> 00:41:47.460 align:start position:0%
pay and benefits
 
00:41:49.849 --> 00:41:49.859 align:start position:0%
through an arbitration clause and and
 
00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:52.380 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:54.050 align:start position:0%
the the
arbiter

00:41:54.050 --> 00:41:54.060 align:start position:0%
arbiter
 
00:41:57.109 --> 00:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
so no one gets a free pass for anything
 
00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:00.660 align:start position:0%
because there's always things you cannot
 
00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:02.810 align:start position:0%
because there's always things you cannot
expect

00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:02.820 align:start position:0%
expect
 
00:42:04.490 --> 00:42:04.500 align:start position:0%
this says you cannot discharge someone
 
00:42:08.329 --> 00:42:08.339 align:start position:0%
for failure to to show up
 
00:42:10.069 --> 00:42:10.079 align:start position:0%
doesn't say reprimand and I understand
 
00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:13.140 align:start position:0%
that's a sticking point with some people
 
00:42:15.290 --> 00:42:15.300 align:start position:0%
but for me this was a major compromise
 
00:42:17.810 --> 00:42:17.820 align:start position:0%
to allow the non-discharge
 
00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:21.720 align:start position:0%
further down in line 16 17 and 18.
 
00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
there needs to be some kind of mechanism
 
00:42:28.609 --> 00:42:28.619 align:start position:0%
where the employer can say no sorry not
 
00:42:28.619 --> 00:42:29.930 align:start position:0%
where the employer can say no sorry not
today

00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:29.940 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
something Big's going on we have a
 
00:42:34.069 --> 00:42:34.079 align:start position:0%
container that's coming that has to be
 
00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:37.140 align:start position:0%
removed you are the one it person and
 
00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:39.180 align:start position:0%
you have to turn over the computers
 
00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
today something could possibly be
 
00:42:43.370 --> 00:42:43.380 align:start position:0%
happening which would they would the
 
00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
employer would have to say no or tell
 
00:42:47.089 --> 00:42:47.099 align:start position:0%
you two weeks in advance I'm sorry next
 
00:42:50.270 --> 00:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
Friday we have something going on
 
00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
you can't do this now
 
00:42:56.810 --> 00:42:56.820 align:start position:0%
I took it upon myself to speak with two
 
00:42:58.849 --> 00:42:58.859 align:start position:0%
Fire Chiefs
 
00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
one who has full-time employees
 
00:43:03.410 --> 00:43:03.420 align:start position:0%
who off the Record doesn't like this
 
00:43:05.809 --> 00:43:05.819 align:start position:0%
bill as written
 
00:43:08.690 --> 00:43:08.700 align:start position:0%
and I couldn't think why
 
00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:12.180 align:start position:0%
I was amazed when he finally told me why
 
00:43:14.930 --> 00:43:14.940 align:start position:0%
because he has individuals who are also
 
00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
full-time firefighters and volunteer
 
00:43:19.490 --> 00:43:19.500 align:start position:0%
firefighters in their towns
 
00:43:21.290 --> 00:43:21.300 align:start position:0%
and when they can't show off he has to
 
00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:22.980 align:start position:0%
pay overtime to get someone to stay on
 
00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
never even thought of that
 
00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:31.260 align:start position:0%
talk to another fire chief who was a
 
00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
chief of a volunteer fire department out
 
00:43:35.930 --> 00:43:35.940 align:start position:0%
in the Peterborough area
 
00:43:38.210 --> 00:43:38.220 align:start position:0%
and I said what happens when you can't
 
00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:41.400 align:start position:0%
show up what happens if an employer says
 
00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
when he told me exactly what happens New
 
00:43:45.349 --> 00:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire ball bearing anyone remember
 
00:43:46.430 --> 00:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
when that
 
00:43:49.609 --> 00:43:49.619 align:start position:0%
had a big explosion there
 
00:43:51.710 --> 00:43:51.720 align:start position:0%
um they couldn't get enough people every
 
00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
single fire department has Mutual Aid
 
00:43:56.809 --> 00:43:56.819 align:start position:0%
that they can call in when they don't
 
00:43:59.210 --> 00:43:59.220 align:start position:0%
have enough people
 
00:44:02.089 --> 00:44:02.099 align:start position:0%
there's not one case that I'm aware of
 
00:44:04.849 --> 00:44:04.859 align:start position:0%
where anyone has been fired
 
00:44:07.069 --> 00:44:07.079 align:start position:0%
we're not showing up
 
00:44:10.130 --> 00:44:10.140 align:start position:0%
I know what brought up on this bill
 
00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
where you have an individual who is a
 
00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
fire chief of a volunteer fire
 
00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:22.790 align:start position:0%
fire chief of a volunteer fire
department

00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:28.380 align:start position:0%
and the boss where he works for the town
 
00:44:30.890 --> 00:44:30.900 align:start position:0%
doesn't like it
 
00:44:33.410 --> 00:44:33.420 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry folks I don't make law for one
 
00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:34.790 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry folks I don't make law for one
situation

00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:44:36.890 --> 00:44:36.900 align:start position:0%
we have not heard any information that
 
00:44:40.910 --> 00:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:43.260 align:start position:0%
so I do the best I could
 
00:44:45.650 --> 00:44:45.660 align:start position:0%
to be able to say
 
00:44:48.650 --> 00:44:48.660 align:start position:0%
yes you should be able to go
 
00:44:51.230 --> 00:44:51.240 align:start position:0%
but the the owner of the company has to
 
00:44:53.630 --> 00:44:53.640 align:start position:0%
at some point they have the ability to
 
00:44:55.609 --> 00:44:55.619 align:start position:0%
say no
 
00:44:57.950 --> 00:44:57.960 align:start position:0%
and if at the end of the shift
 
00:45:00.410 --> 00:45:00.420 align:start position:0%
they get all the stuff can the computers
 
00:45:01.849 --> 00:45:01.859 align:start position:0%
turned over the container is empty
 
00:45:03.770 --> 00:45:03.780 align:start position:0%
everything's done
 
00:45:06.170 --> 00:45:06.180 align:start position:0%
um then you can go ahead and go we have
 
00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:07.980 align:start position:0%
our own representative here who's not
 
00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:11.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:13.020 align:start position:0%
um that's what he does his landscape
 
00:45:15.170 --> 00:45:15.180 align:start position:0%
company yesterday he could not have
 
00:45:18.349 --> 00:45:18.359 align:start position:0%
allowed someone to go to a fire
 
00:45:19.849 --> 00:45:19.859 align:start position:0%
he thinks it would have been too
 
00:45:19.859 --> 00:45:23.270 align:start position:0%
he thinks it would have been too
detrimental

00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:25.790 --> 00:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
I've done the best I can
 
00:45:27.650 --> 00:45:27.660 align:start position:0%
to try to meet
 
00:45:29.329 --> 00:45:29.339 align:start position:0%
somewhere between where the bill
 
00:45:29.339 --> 00:45:30.650 align:start position:0%
somewhere between where the bill
presents

00:45:30.650 --> 00:45:30.660 align:start position:0%
presents
 
00:45:32.990 --> 00:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
and what employers need
 
00:45:36.650 --> 00:45:36.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:40.609 --> 00:45:40.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:42.180 align:start position:0%
thanks Mr chairman
 
00:45:44.569 --> 00:45:44.579 align:start position:0%
um I will be opposing Amendment zero
 
00:45:46.490 --> 00:45:46.500 align:start position:0%
nine seven nine I would like to call
 
00:45:49.790 --> 00:45:49.800 align:start position:0%
everybody's attention to uh line 13 of
 
00:45:51.290 --> 00:45:51.300 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
00:45:53.329 --> 00:45:53.339 align:start position:0%
um inserted by section one of the bill
 
00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
inserting after the paragraph one or I
 
00:45:57.470 --> 00:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
the following new paragraph and
 
00:45:59.930 --> 00:45:59.940 align:start position:0%
renumbering the original paragraphs two
 
00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
through four to read as three through
 
00:46:05.210 --> 00:46:05.220 align:start position:0%
five respectively and that is where the
 
00:46:07.250 --> 00:46:07.260 align:start position:0%
line goes in that the chairman
 
00:46:09.050 --> 00:46:09.060 align:start position:0%
referenced at the beginning of which you
 
00:46:10.130 --> 00:46:10.140 align:start position:0%
have to work period in advance of any
 
00:46:12.050 --> 00:46:12.060 align:start position:0%
shift or work period the employer has
 
00:46:13.730 --> 00:46:13.740 align:start position:0%
the right to inform the employee that
 
00:46:14.930 --> 00:46:14.940 align:start position:0%
their presence during the shift is
 
00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
necessary and the employee will not be
 
00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
able to leave for an emergency call
 
00:46:19.970 --> 00:46:19.980 align:start position:0%
without the consent of the employer my
 
00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:21.680 align:start position:0%
read of this is that it does not change
 
00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
the text in what becomes section three
 
00:46:28.730 --> 00:46:28.740 align:start position:0%
as used in this section responding to an
 
00:46:31.490 --> 00:46:31.500 align:start position:0%
emergency xiaomin responding to comma
 
00:46:35.450 --> 00:46:35.460 align:start position:0%
leaving work to respond to comma
 
00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:35.990 align:start position:0%
leaving work to respond to comma
um

00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:39.950 --> 00:46:39.960 align:start position:0%
that sets up inconsistent language where
 
00:46:42.170 --> 00:46:42.180 align:start position:0%
the employer has the right to say you
 
00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
need to stay here and the employee has
 
00:46:46.069 --> 00:46:46.079 align:start position:0%
the right protected by law
 
00:46:49.010 --> 00:46:49.020 align:start position:0%
I guess to tell them cool story bro
 
00:46:52.309 --> 00:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
um that that is a fatal fly in there
 
00:46:52.319 --> 00:46:53.089 align:start position:0%
um that that is a fatal fly in there
um

00:46:53.089 --> 00:46:53.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:54.470 --> 00:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
and I do want to touch on the discipline
 
00:46:57.589 --> 00:46:57.599 align:start position:0%
piece uh as was mentioned earlier
 
00:46:57.599 --> 00:46:58.250 align:start position:0%
piece uh as was mentioned earlier
um

00:46:58.250 --> 00:46:58.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
part of the issue with not specifying
 
00:47:03.109 --> 00:47:03.119 align:start position:0%
that there's a protection against
 
00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
Progressive discipline is that you get
 
00:47:10.309 --> 00:47:10.319 align:start position:0%
three reprimands for having to respond
 
00:47:13.370 --> 00:47:13.380 align:start position:0%
to a call and then the fourth reprimand
 
00:47:15.770 --> 00:47:15.780 align:start position:0%
is you know you accidentally knock over
 
00:47:17.690 --> 00:47:17.700 align:start position:0%
a bucket of water and then oh well
 
00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
that's the issue right there bye
 
00:47:23.150 --> 00:47:23.160 align:start position:0%
um that's an issue that a lot of us on
 
00:47:25.130 --> 00:47:25.140 align:start position:0%
this committee have a concern with
 
00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:26.569 align:start position:0%
this committee have a concern with
um

00:47:26.569 --> 00:47:26.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:30.829 --> 00:47:30.839 align:start position:0%
I I had expressed that concern earlier
 
00:47:33.170 --> 00:47:33.180 align:start position:0%
um and again
 
00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:34.760 align:start position:0%
the fact that
 
00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
this doesn't allow somebody to respond
 
00:47:39.829 --> 00:47:39.839 align:start position:0%
to a fire
 
00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
um is very concerning for me based on
 
00:47:44.690 --> 00:47:44.700 align:start position:0%
the anecdote that I referenced earlier I
 
00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
understand that you know there probably
 
00:47:48.589 --> 00:47:48.599 align:start position:0%
are situations where you're the one
 
00:47:50.329 --> 00:47:50.339 align:start position:0%
employee that can manage something but
 
00:47:52.250 --> 00:47:52.260 align:start position:0%
if somebody's life is at risk
 
00:47:54.530 --> 00:47:54.540 align:start position:0%
in the instance of a fire or an
 
00:47:56.809 --> 00:47:56.819 align:start position:0%
emergency medical situation I'm sorry
 
00:47:58.670 --> 00:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
but if I have to pick between somebody
 
00:48:01.010 --> 00:48:01.020 align:start position:0%
that's trapped in a burning building or
 
00:48:02.930 --> 00:48:02.940 align:start position:0%
some software I'm going to pick the
 
00:48:04.069 --> 00:48:04.079 align:start position:0%
person that's trapped in the burning
 
00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
building that is non-negotiable for me
 
00:48:09.650 --> 00:48:09.660 align:start position:0%
um there are things that I think that we
 
00:48:11.210 --> 00:48:11.220 align:start position:0%
could have worked on
 
00:48:14.450 --> 00:48:14.460 align:start position:0%
um I just this is a really hard Bill to
 
00:48:16.130 --> 00:48:16.140 align:start position:0%
try to split the difference off because
 
00:48:19.910 --> 00:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
as I referenced in a reply all last
 
00:48:23.390 --> 00:48:23.400 align:start position:0%
night this bill was so well written by
 
00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
both the sponsors and OLS that it is a
 
00:48:29.930 --> 00:48:29.940 align:start position:0%
very delicate Jenga Tower and by
 
00:48:32.450 --> 00:48:32.460 align:start position:0%
removing the wrong load bearing block
 
00:48:36.170 --> 00:48:36.180 align:start position:0%
you run the risk of toppling it and that
 
00:48:37.550 --> 00:48:37.560 align:start position:0%
is a concern here that I have with this
 
00:48:39.109 --> 00:48:39.119 align:start position:0%
amendment as well specifically with that
 
00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
flow issue and also referencing the
 
00:48:42.970 --> 00:48:42.980 align:start position:0%
disciplinary issue
 
00:48:45.770 --> 00:48:45.780 align:start position:0%
in section one so for those reasons I
 
00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:52.849 --> 00:48:52.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
I think I'd like to add something
 
00:48:58.130 --> 00:48:58.140 align:start position:0%
um we had some discussion there that
 
00:49:01.309 --> 00:49:01.319 align:start position:0%
implies the difference between the
 
00:49:04.250 --> 00:49:04.260 align:start position:0%
volunteer who's out there to save a life
 
00:49:06.829 --> 00:49:06.839 align:start position:0%
versus their other role as an employee
 
00:49:10.309 --> 00:49:10.319 align:start position:0%
maybe stocks stacking boxes in the in
 
00:49:12.170 --> 00:49:12.180 align:start position:0%
the back room
 
00:49:15.109 --> 00:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned software as as an
 
00:49:17.569 --> 00:49:17.579 align:start position:0%
example and it made me think of my own
 
00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
experience some years ago I was working
 
00:49:25.390 --> 00:49:25.400 align:start position:0%
for a large utility
 
00:49:28.430 --> 00:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
on their software that ran their control
 
00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:31.500 align:start position:0%
center in their distribution for one of
 
00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
the major cities in the United States
 
00:49:37.150 --> 00:49:37.160 align:start position:0%
part of keeping that software running
 
00:49:40.210 --> 00:49:40.220 align:start position:0%
particularly during a crisis hot weather
 
00:49:42.430 --> 00:49:42.440 align:start position:0%
other outages
 
00:49:45.890 --> 00:49:45.900 align:start position:0%
meant that power was supplied to the
 
00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
major hospitals to the police stations
 
00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:50.960 align:start position:0%
to the fire departments
 
00:49:55.010 --> 00:49:55.020 align:start position:0%
I know we can sit here and say oh all I
 
00:49:58.130 --> 00:49:58.140 align:start position:0%
care about is saving a life but we don't
 
00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
know what every single employer is doing
 
00:50:07.250 --> 00:50:07.260 align:start position:0%
and when do decisions that we make
 
00:50:11.450 --> 00:50:11.460 align:start position:0%
threaten life and safety because of of
 
00:50:13.490 --> 00:50:13.500 align:start position:0%
what we've dictated
 
00:50:16.550 --> 00:50:16.560 align:start position:0%
so I don't think it's as clear as as
 
00:50:18.609 --> 00:50:18.619 align:start position:0%
black and white
 
00:50:21.829 --> 00:50:21.839 align:start position:0%
I see representative adjutant wants to
 
00:50:24.770 --> 00:50:24.780 align:start position:0%
respond thank you Mr chairman I while I
 
00:50:26.630 --> 00:50:26.640 align:start position:0%
do understand your point
 
00:50:27.890 --> 00:50:27.900 align:start position:0%
um I would like to provide a little
 
00:50:30.890 --> 00:50:30.900 align:start position:0%
context based on my work experience
 
00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
um as some folks know I'm a security
 
00:50:34.609 --> 00:50:34.619 align:start position:0%
officer at Dartmouth Health in Lebanon
 
00:50:36.109 --> 00:50:36.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:50:40.069 --> 00:50:40.079 align:start position:0%
um Dartmouth health because it's a dhmc
 
00:50:42.770 --> 00:50:42.780 align:start position:0%
is such a huge campus we operate on a
 
00:50:46.370 --> 00:50:46.380 align:start position:0%
dispatch system we have a Soc at the
 
00:50:47.870 --> 00:50:47.880 align:start position:0%
main front of the hospital when you walk
 
00:50:50.450 --> 00:50:50.460 align:start position:0%
in it's the door right on the left
 
00:50:53.870 --> 00:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
um and each officer on shift has a radio
 
00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:54.770 align:start position:0%
um and each officer on shift has a radio
um

00:50:54.770 --> 00:50:54.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:57.829 --> 00:50:57.839 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth has a system of duress buttons
 
00:50:59.510 --> 00:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
so in the back of your badge it's got a
 
00:51:01.250 --> 00:51:01.260 align:start position:0%
little button and if an employee is in
 
00:51:03.349 --> 00:51:03.359 align:start position:0%
danger they can push the button it'll
 
00:51:05.870 --> 00:51:05.880 align:start position:0%
immediately go to our SOC and officers
 
00:51:08.270 --> 00:51:08.280 align:start position:0%
are sent there
 
00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
if a duress alarm goes off it
 
00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
immediately goes out to every officer
 
00:51:16.790 --> 00:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
and every officer is expected to respond
 
00:51:19.010 --> 00:51:19.020 align:start position:0%
unless you are in the psych Zone which
 
00:51:20.809 --> 00:51:20.819 align:start position:0%
is an area that we can't leave it
 
00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter what you're doing uh
 
00:51:24.290 --> 00:51:24.300 align:start position:0%
there is an expectation that all those
 
00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:26.460 align:start position:0%
officers will respond to a duress alarm
 
00:51:28.970 --> 00:51:28.980 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's an accidental push but
 
00:51:31.549 --> 00:51:31.559 align:start position:0%
sometimes it means that medical staff is
 
00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:33.480 align:start position:0%
actively being attacked by a patient
 
00:51:36.770 --> 00:51:36.780 align:start position:0%
especially in some of our psych areas
 
00:51:36.780 --> 00:51:37.430 align:start position:0%
especially in some of our psych areas
um

00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
those calls don't happen
 
00:51:42.650 --> 00:51:42.660 align:start position:0%
um flippantly
 
00:51:46.430 --> 00:51:46.440 align:start position:0%
they come across the tram uh because
 
00:51:48.170 --> 00:51:48.180 align:start position:0%
there have been incidents in the past
 
00:51:49.910 --> 00:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
where employees have been severely
 
00:51:51.290 --> 00:51:51.300 align:start position:0%
injured and there wasn't a duress system
 
00:51:53.569 --> 00:51:53.579 align:start position:0%
and that's why it's put in there
 
00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
um likewise
 
00:51:57.589 --> 00:51:57.599 align:start position:0%
if a call goes out to volunteer
 
00:51:59.870 --> 00:51:59.880 align:start position:0%
firefighters it's not because the cat is
 
00:52:01.370 --> 00:52:01.380 align:start position:0%
stuck in a tree
 
00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
it is because a building is on fire or
 
00:52:08.450 --> 00:52:08.460 align:start position:0%
somebody's life is at risk that is why
 
00:52:10.730 --> 00:52:10.740 align:start position:0%
those calls go out
 
00:52:12.890 --> 00:52:12.900 align:start position:0%
um yes if there was a world where a
 
00:52:14.809 --> 00:52:14.819 align:start position:0%
volunteer firefighter was you know
 
00:52:17.270 --> 00:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
called out because a fire hydrant is
 
00:52:20.270 --> 00:52:20.280 align:start position:0%
leaking a little bit uh and they've got
 
00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:22.200 align:start position:0%
a really you know important thing that
 
00:52:23.870 --> 00:52:23.880 align:start position:0%
they're doing at work yes I could
 
00:52:25.549 --> 00:52:25.559 align:start position:0%
understand that being the case as to why
 
00:52:27.589 --> 00:52:27.599 align:start position:0%
you know it would make sense to have
 
00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
somebody else do it or not let them out
 
00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
but the fact of the matter is that when
 
00:52:34.069 --> 00:52:34.079 align:start position:0%
you know code red comes over the radio
 
00:52:35.630 --> 00:52:35.640 align:start position:0%
and you get an address there is an
 
00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
expectation that somebody's life is at
 
00:52:40.010 --> 00:52:40.020 align:start position:0%
risk or somebody's property is at risk
 
00:52:44.510 --> 00:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
or something has risen to a degree where
 
00:52:46.730 --> 00:52:46.740 align:start position:0%
it is imperative
 
00:52:49.010 --> 00:52:49.020 align:start position:0%
that those people respond and that is
 
00:52:49.020 --> 00:52:49.790 align:start position:0%
that those people respond and that is
why

00:52:49.790 --> 00:52:49.800 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:52:51.770 --> 00:52:51.780 align:start position:0%
as I reference the bill is so well
 
00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
crafted that the employer can request
 
00:52:57.410 --> 00:52:57.420 align:start position:0%
verification from the fire chief that
 
00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
this was a situation where uh life or
 
00:53:03.470 --> 00:53:03.480 align:start position:0%
property was at risk and severe risk and
 
00:53:05.690 --> 00:53:05.700 align:start position:0%
they need to verify that so
 
00:53:08.450 --> 00:53:08.460 align:start position:0%
I don't want to flippantly dismiss
 
00:53:11.510 --> 00:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
um other work as unimportant rather I
 
00:53:14.030 --> 00:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
want to make the case that in a
 
00:53:16.190 --> 00:53:16.200 align:start position:0%
situation where a volunteer firefighter
 
00:53:19.270 --> 00:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
or an EMS person is expected to respond
 
00:53:24.349 --> 00:53:24.359 align:start position:0%
is so incredibly critical to saving life
 
00:53:28.790 --> 00:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
or saving property that I I really can't
 
00:53:31.010 --> 00:53:31.020 align:start position:0%
justify another situation
 
00:53:32.930 --> 00:53:32.940 align:start position:0%
um where that wouldn't be the case so I
 
00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
will continue to oppose the amendment
 
00:53:37.849 --> 00:53:37.859 align:start position:0%
representative Cahill
 
00:53:41.930 --> 00:53:41.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I I I can't support
 
00:53:44.210 --> 00:53:44.220 align:start position:0%
this amendment either but I think we
 
00:53:46.970 --> 00:53:46.980 align:start position:0%
need to do more work on the bill to
 
00:53:48.770 --> 00:53:48.780 align:start position:0%
gather more information from other
 
00:53:50.089 --> 00:53:50.099 align:start position:0%
people who are involved and I was
 
00:53:52.430 --> 00:53:52.440 align:start position:0%
missing both the last year when it was
 
00:53:54.109 --> 00:53:54.119 align:start position:0%
introduced and this year we really
 
00:53:56.690 --> 00:53:56.700 align:start position:0%
didn't get enough about
 
00:53:59.030 --> 00:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
how the fire departments function what
 
00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
you know and so I think we need more
 
00:54:02.809 --> 00:54:02.819 align:start position:0%
work on the bill I would prefer to
 
00:54:06.530 --> 00:54:06.540 align:start position:0%
retain it uh to then passing it with the
 
00:54:07.970 --> 00:54:07.980 align:start position:0%
amendment or
 
00:54:10.730 --> 00:54:10.740 align:start position:0%
or killing it
 
00:54:13.970 --> 00:54:13.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:16.609 --> 00:54:16.619 align:start position:0%
I'll go with representative love
 
00:54:19.730 --> 00:54:19.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh I'll be supporting
 
00:54:21.890 --> 00:54:21.900 align:start position:0%
this amendment um I think I think it's a
 
00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:24.720 align:start position:0%
great compromise uh I I don't think that
 
00:54:27.410 --> 00:54:27.420 align:start position:0%
we can uh continue to to take take
 
00:54:29.270 --> 00:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
rights away from especially a small
 
00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:30.410 align:start position:0%
rights away from especially a small
business

00:54:30.410 --> 00:54:30.420 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:54:30.420 --> 00:54:32.030 align:start position:0%
business
owners

00:54:32.030 --> 00:54:32.040 align:start position:0%
owners
 
00:54:33.890 --> 00:54:33.900 align:start position:0%
um you know if you've got five guys
 
00:54:35.870 --> 00:54:35.880 align:start position:0%
working for you and you take one away
 
00:54:38.329 --> 00:54:38.339 align:start position:0%
that that's a big chunk there's nothing
 
00:54:41.450 --> 00:54:41.460 align:start position:0%
here in this bill that that stops IT in
 
00:54:43.069 --> 00:54:43.079 align:start position:0%
fact as representative infantine
 
00:54:45.049 --> 00:54:45.059 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh if it's if you've got 50
 
00:54:46.970 --> 00:54:46.980 align:start position:0%
people working for you
 
00:54:50.329 --> 00:54:50.339 align:start position:0%
and the one it guy has to go uh it could
 
00:54:52.670 --> 00:54:52.680 align:start position:0%
shut down the business for the day
 
00:54:54.109 --> 00:54:54.119 align:start position:0%
because of the fact that we do have
 
00:54:55.490 --> 00:54:55.500 align:start position:0%
mutual Aid
 
00:54:58.490 --> 00:54:58.500 align:start position:0%
and uh you know it that kind of takes up
 
00:55:00.890 --> 00:55:00.900 align:start position:0%
the the slack
 
00:55:02.750 --> 00:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
um you know we got to stop beating up
 
00:55:05.870 --> 00:55:05.880 align:start position:0%
our small business owners you know uh it
 
00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:08.640 align:start position:0%
I I fail to hear this a lot you know in
 
00:55:10.670 --> 00:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
these in these hearings uh the the small
 
00:55:12.890 --> 00:55:12.900 align:start position:0%
businessman owner in this state is you
 
00:55:14.750 --> 00:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
know the the backbone of our our
 
00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
industry and uh and and they deserve
 
00:55:19.430 --> 00:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
some consideration here and I don't
 
00:55:21.589 --> 00:55:21.599 align:start position:0%
think uh you know that the bill as
 
00:55:24.290 --> 00:55:24.300 align:start position:0%
originally constructed uh gives the many
 
00:55:27.230 --> 00:55:27.240 align:start position:0%
and the the amendment is a a good
 
00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:28.430 align:start position:0%
and the the amendment is a a good
compromise

00:55:28.430 --> 00:55:28.440 align:start position:0%
compromise
 
00:55:31.670 --> 00:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative McKenzie
 
00:55:33.410 --> 00:55:33.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh we we just heard from the
 
00:55:37.490 --> 00:55:37.500 align:start position:0%
unemployment office about
 
00:55:39.290 --> 00:55:39.300 align:start position:0%
the unemployment numbers in New
 
00:55:41.150 --> 00:55:41.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I think if the paper is
 
00:55:43.790 --> 00:55:43.800 align:start position:0%
correct it was around three percent
 
00:55:46.430 --> 00:55:46.440 align:start position:0%
which means that for the most part
 
00:55:48.290 --> 00:55:48.300 align:start position:0%
people are working
 
00:55:50.210 --> 00:55:50.220 align:start position:0%
and communities all throughout the state
 
00:55:51.890 --> 00:55:51.900 align:start position:0%
there's very few people that are not
 
00:55:51.900 --> 00:55:53.510 align:start position:0%
there's very few people that are not
working

00:55:53.510 --> 00:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
working
 
00:55:56.089 --> 00:55:56.099 align:start position:0%
you have town after town after town who
 
00:55:58.670 --> 00:55:58.680 align:start position:0%
relies on volunteer firefighters
 
00:56:01.370 --> 00:56:01.380 align:start position:0%
and they have made that choice the
 
00:56:03.049 --> 00:56:03.059 align:start position:0%
communities have made that choice to
 
00:56:06.170 --> 00:56:06.180 align:start position:0%
have uh volunteer firefighters as
 
00:56:08.210 --> 00:56:08.220 align:start position:0%
opposed to full-time firefighters and
 
00:56:10.069 --> 00:56:10.079 align:start position:0%
EMS people that's a decision they've
 
00:56:10.079 --> 00:56:11.150 align:start position:0%
EMS people that's a decision they've
made

00:56:11.150 --> 00:56:11.160 align:start position:0%
made
 
00:56:14.690 --> 00:56:14.700 align:start position:0%
now that that's where the rub comes down
 
00:56:16.690 --> 00:56:16.700 align:start position:0%
for me whenever we talk about this stuff
 
00:56:19.849 --> 00:56:19.859 align:start position:0%
if the the employees in communities
 
00:56:21.950 --> 00:56:21.960 align:start position:0%
can't have it both ways
 
00:56:24.109 --> 00:56:24.119 align:start position:0%
they're either going to fund the fund
 
00:56:26.150 --> 00:56:26.160 align:start position:0%
money bring the money up and put the
 
00:56:28.790 --> 00:56:28.800 align:start position:0%
money towards a budget that'll fund uh
 
00:56:31.010 --> 00:56:31.020 align:start position:0%
full-time firefighters and EMS Personnel
 
00:56:33.530 --> 00:56:33.540 align:start position:0%
or they're gonna they're gonna begin the
 
00:56:35.089 --> 00:56:35.099 align:start position:0%
process of understanding that the only
 
00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
way we're going to do this without
 
00:56:39.190 --> 00:56:39.200 align:start position:0%
raising taxes is to allow people to go
 
00:56:43.490 --> 00:56:43.500 align:start position:0%
uh from a lot of people out of work now
 
00:56:46.910 --> 00:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
I think this is an important piece of
 
00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
legislation I think it's something we
 
00:56:50.750 --> 00:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
need to think about and work on I think
 
00:56:53.329 --> 00:56:53.339 align:start position:0%
the concept of retaining makes some
 
00:56:53.339 --> 00:56:54.230 align:start position:0%
the concept of retaining makes some
sense

00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
sense
 
00:56:58.670 --> 00:56:58.680 align:start position:0%
but the this is if if we take away uh
 
00:57:00.530 --> 00:57:00.540 align:start position:0%
volunteer firefighters from the system
 
00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we're in big trouble
 
00:57:04.549 --> 00:57:04.559 align:start position:0%
and as somebody who spent 27 years on
 
00:57:05.930 --> 00:57:05.940 align:start position:0%
the fire department and the biggest one
 
00:57:07.609 --> 00:57:07.619 align:start position:0%
in the city of uh city of Manchester
 
00:57:09.650 --> 00:57:09.660 align:start position:0%
we're in big trouble
 
00:57:11.750 --> 00:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
because many towns don't have any
 
00:57:14.569 --> 00:57:14.579 align:start position:0%
options and the concept that uh we're
 
00:57:17.329 --> 00:57:17.339 align:start position:0%
going to allow Manchester fire to go to
 
00:57:19.730 --> 00:57:19.740 align:start position:0%
Milford or Amherst to cover a mutual
 
00:57:19.740 --> 00:57:20.569 align:start position:0%
Milford or Amherst to cover a mutual
weight

00:57:20.569 --> 00:57:20.579 align:start position:0%
weight
 
00:57:22.130 --> 00:57:22.140 align:start position:0%
that's not going to last too long
 
00:57:24.049 --> 00:57:24.059 align:start position:0%
because we're not going to spend our
 
00:57:27.230 --> 00:57:27.240 align:start position:0%
resources uh from a big from a big city
 
00:57:29.270 --> 00:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
to cover people who should be doing that
 
00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
on their own and that's not to say we
 
00:57:32.270 --> 00:57:32.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be there for the second
 
00:57:34.370 --> 00:57:34.380 align:start position:0%
alignment third line but we're not going
 
00:57:36.109 --> 00:57:36.119 align:start position:0%
to have firefighters crossing city
 
00:57:38.030 --> 00:57:38.040 align:start position:0%
Alliance because you don't have
 
00:57:39.589 --> 00:57:39.599 align:start position:0%
sufficient Fire Protection in other
 
00:57:42.890 --> 00:57:42.900 align:start position:0%
communities I think this I think if we
 
00:57:44.809 --> 00:57:44.819 align:start position:0%
would uh I'm not sure the amendment this
 
00:57:47.150 --> 00:57:47.160 align:start position:0%
amendment meets it but I think the the
 
00:57:49.250 --> 00:57:49.260 align:start position:0%
uh the concept is something that we need
 
00:57:51.230 --> 00:57:51.240 align:start position:0%
to work on in this committee and we need
 
00:57:52.670 --> 00:57:52.680 align:start position:0%
to find a place where everybody's
 
00:57:55.370 --> 00:57:55.380 align:start position:0%
comfortable and employers need to be at
 
00:57:58.490 --> 00:57:58.500 align:start position:0%
the table as well as uh as others in the
 
00:58:00.589 --> 00:58:00.599 align:start position:0%
community so that we can uh we can come
 
00:58:02.930 --> 00:58:02.940 align:start position:0%
to a consensus about how this is going
 
00:58:04.990 --> 00:58:05.000 align:start position:0%
to work in our state of New Hampshire it
 
00:58:07.910 --> 00:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
volunteer firefighters we've worked very
 
00:58:10.790 --> 00:58:10.800 align:start position:0%
hard to bring the specs up you know they
 
00:58:12.470 --> 00:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
meet certain standards they never had to
 
00:58:14.690 --> 00:58:14.700 align:start position:0%
meet before they make a big investment
 
00:58:17.210 --> 00:58:17.220 align:start position:0%
in their in their education and their
 
00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
training and the communities benefit
 
00:58:22.370 --> 00:58:22.380 align:start position:0%
from having those people there as do the
 
00:58:24.109 --> 00:58:24.119 align:start position:0%
Employers in those communities they
 
00:58:25.970 --> 00:58:25.980 align:start position:0%
benefit so we need to find some way to
 
00:58:27.890 --> 00:58:27.900 align:start position:0%
to address this and work through these
 
00:58:27.900 --> 00:58:29.150 align:start position:0%
to address this and work through these
decision

00:58:29.150 --> 00:58:29.160 align:start position:0%
decision
 
00:58:32.150 --> 00:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:34.849 --> 00:58:34.859 align:start position:0%
representative Cahill yes thank you Mr
 
00:58:36.770 --> 00:58:36.780 align:start position:0%
chair I meant to add that you know one
 
00:58:38.450 --> 00:58:38.460 align:start position:0%
of the things we could consider would be
 
00:58:40.549 --> 00:58:40.559 align:start position:0%
an exemption for some number of
 
00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
employees and under that you know that
 
00:58:44.390 --> 00:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
would that would be acceptable but I
 
00:58:46.130 --> 00:58:46.140 align:start position:0%
also think that as uh
 
00:58:48.289 --> 00:58:48.299 align:start position:0%
uh representative Sullivan had mentioned
 
00:58:49.910 --> 00:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
during the hearing most people would be
 
00:58:52.430 --> 00:58:52.440 align:start position:0%
self-selecting and thinking that well my
 
00:58:54.530 --> 00:58:54.540 align:start position:0%
job would not allow me to leave so
 
00:58:56.390 --> 00:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
therefore I can't be the person to
 
00:58:58.970 --> 00:58:58.980 align:start position:0%
volunteer on the fire department so
 
00:59:01.069 --> 00:59:01.079 align:start position:0%
that's another thing to consider I don't
 
00:59:02.569 --> 00:59:02.579 align:start position:0%
know that we're going to have the I the
 
00:59:04.849 --> 00:59:04.859 align:start position:0%
one I T person or the person that's
 
00:59:06.410 --> 00:59:06.420 align:start position:0%
supposed to fly the plane out of Logan
 
00:59:09.349 --> 00:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
at 10 o'clock that day uh volunteering
 
00:59:11.690 --> 00:59:11.700 align:start position:0%
to serve on the fire department but when
 
00:59:13.849 --> 00:59:13.859 align:start position:0%
the people who can do it we think we
 
00:59:16.069 --> 00:59:16.079 align:start position:0%
need to find a way that it works for
 
00:59:18.049 --> 00:59:18.059 align:start position:0%
both sides of the equation
 
00:59:20.270 --> 00:59:20.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:59:20.280 --> 00:59:22.190 align:start position:0%
thank you
uh

00:59:22.190 --> 00:59:22.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:23.329 align:start position:0%
uh
uh

00:59:23.329 --> 00:59:23.339 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:59:26.450 --> 00:59:26.460 align:start position:0%
representative vulgar sorry
 
00:59:28.370 --> 00:59:28.380 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:59:28.380 --> 00:59:30.470 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:59:30.470 --> 00:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:32.690 --> 00:59:32.700 align:start position:0%
and sitting here listening to this going
 
00:59:35.809 --> 00:59:35.819 align:start position:0%
back and forth it
 
00:59:39.530 --> 00:59:39.540 align:start position:0%
concerns me that if we passed such a
 
00:59:40.609 --> 00:59:40.619 align:start position:0%
strict bill
 
00:59:40.619 --> 00:59:42.170 align:start position:0%
strict bill
that

00:59:42.170 --> 00:59:42.180 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:59:44.569 --> 00:59:44.579 align:start position:0%
says the employer can't do this the
 
00:59:47.690 --> 00:59:47.700 align:start position:0%
employer can't do that does this now
 
00:59:50.750 --> 00:59:50.760 align:start position:0%
create a situation where you've got a
 
00:59:53.390 --> 00:59:53.400 align:start position:0%
small company and now the employer has
 
00:59:57.770 --> 00:59:57.780 align:start position:0%
two candidates that they want to hire
 
01:00:02.270 --> 01:00:02.280 align:start position:0%
and they obviously picked the other now
 
01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
because this one's going to be
 
01:00:06.589 --> 01:00:06.599 align:start position:0%
encumbered with such
 
01:00:06.599 --> 01:00:07.930 align:start position:0%
encumbered with such
uh

01:00:07.930 --> 01:00:07.940 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:00:11.210 --> 01:00:11.220 align:start position:0%
restrictions that would allow them and
 
01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
hinder his ability to do work where
 
01:00:17.349 --> 01:00:17.359 align:start position:0%
candidate Aid doesn't have any of these
 
01:00:20.089 --> 01:00:20.099 align:start position:0%
encumbrance then
 
01:00:23.450 --> 01:00:23.460 align:start position:0%
would that change the hiring mechanism
 
01:00:26.569 --> 01:00:26.579 align:start position:0%
that is being done because now it might
 
01:00:28.069 --> 01:00:28.079 align:start position:0%
be covered in another portion another
 
01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
law forgive me for my ignorance in that
 
01:00:32.990 --> 01:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
situation but based on what I've read
 
01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.089 align:start position:0%
situation but based on what I've read
here

01:00:35.089 --> 01:00:35.099 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:00:37.970 --> 01:00:37.980 align:start position:0%
you're putting all the onus on the
 
01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:40.730 align:start position:0%
you're putting all the onus on the
employer

01:00:40.730 --> 01:00:40.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:42.650 --> 01:00:42.660 align:start position:0%
so they're going to end up making
 
01:00:42.660 --> 01:00:44.030 align:start position:0%
so they're going to end up making
decisions

01:00:44.030 --> 01:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
01:00:46.549 --> 01:00:46.559 align:start position:0%
about who they're going to hire and who
 
01:00:48.650 --> 01:00:48.660 align:start position:0%
they're not going to hire
 
01:00:52.010 --> 01:00:52.020 align:start position:0%
whether it be upfront or beside or
 
01:00:54.710 --> 01:00:54.720 align:start position:0%
whatever reason you take those
 
01:00:57.230 --> 01:00:57.240 align:start position:0%
encumbrance when you add these laws to
 
01:01:02.930 --> 01:01:02.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:06.250 --> 01:01:06.260 align:start position:0%
thank you any further discussion
 
01:01:09.250 --> 01:01:09.260 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan
 
01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
um rep Cahill just brought it up and I
 
01:01:17.809 --> 01:01:17.819 align:start position:0%
was uh did want to emphasize that
 
01:01:17.819 --> 01:01:18.829 align:start position:0%
was uh did want to emphasize that
um

01:01:18.829 --> 01:01:18.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:21.720 align:start position:0%
people uh who decide to become volunteer
 
01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
firefighters decide to do it because
 
01:01:26.210 --> 01:01:26.220 align:start position:0%
they can they have a the type of
 
01:01:29.390 --> 01:01:29.400 align:start position:0%
lifestyle and job that will allow them
 
01:01:31.130 --> 01:01:31.140 align:start position:0%
to be able to do it
 
01:01:33.589 --> 01:01:33.599 align:start position:0%
um so I I firmly believe and frankly I
 
01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:35.160 align:start position:0%
would have liked to have been on you
 
01:01:37.730 --> 01:01:37.740 align:start position:0%
know my Grantham fire department
 
01:01:40.250 --> 01:01:40.260 align:start position:0%
um but my job just didn't have that kind
 
01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
of flexibility I was I'm generally not
 
01:01:44.809 --> 01:01:44.819 align:start position:0%
in town what good is a volunteer
 
01:01:47.630 --> 01:01:47.640 align:start position:0%
firefighter who's uh hour and a half
 
01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:49.010 align:start position:0%
firefighter who's uh hour and a half
away

01:01:49.010 --> 01:01:49.020 align:start position:0%
away
 
01:01:52.370 --> 01:01:52.380 align:start position:0%
um so um I think people
 
01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
and that's part of the reason it's hard
 
01:01:55.750 --> 01:01:55.760 align:start position:0%
to find volunteer
 
01:01:58.430 --> 01:01:58.440 align:start position:0%
firefighters because basically there are
 
01:01:59.930 --> 01:01:59.940 align:start position:0%
only so many people who have that kind
 
01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
of flexibility in in their life to be
 
01:02:04.430 --> 01:02:04.440 align:start position:0%
able to do it
 
01:02:07.370 --> 01:02:07.380 align:start position:0%
um and um and for that reason I don't
 
01:02:10.670 --> 01:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
think the um the ability to say no is
 
01:02:13.490 --> 01:02:13.500 align:start position:0%
really that necessary because I think
 
01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:17.160 align:start position:0%
the the employees have probably figured
 
01:02:19.609 --> 01:02:19.619 align:start position:0%
out already that they can't uh handle it
 
01:02:21.650 --> 01:02:21.660 align:start position:0%
with their particular job and there's
 
01:02:24.109 --> 01:02:24.119 align:start position:0%
lots of jobs that don't mix well with uh
 
01:02:26.210 --> 01:02:26.220 align:start position:0%
volunteer firefighting
 
01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:26.890 align:start position:0%
volunteer firefighting
um

01:02:26.890 --> 01:02:26.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:29.390 --> 01:02:29.400 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:02:32.690 --> 01:02:32.700 align:start position:0%
and and I I will also emphasize that the
 
01:02:36.289 --> 01:02:36.299 align:start position:0%
um inability to uh or or the allowance
 
01:02:39.289 --> 01:02:39.299 align:start position:0%
of disciplinary action is a real problem
 
01:02:42.109 --> 01:02:42.119 align:start position:0%
if you can discipline someone each time
 
01:02:45.349 --> 01:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
that they um go out on a call
 
01:02:45.359 --> 01:02:46.490 align:start position:0%
that they um go out on a call
um

01:02:46.490 --> 01:02:46.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:48.470 --> 01:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
you can't fire them for that but you can
 
01:02:49.970 --> 01:02:49.980 align:start position:0%
discipline them over and over and over
 
01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:50.750 align:start position:0%
discipline them over and over and over
again

01:02:50.750 --> 01:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:02:52.549 --> 01:02:52.559 align:start position:0%
and then there's some type of
 
01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
transgression that takes place somewhere
 
01:02:57.950 --> 01:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
down the line if it's your um your 10th
 
01:02:57.960 --> 01:02:59.870 align:start position:0%
down the line if it's your um your 10th
reprimand

01:02:59.870 --> 01:02:59.880 align:start position:0%
reprimand
 
01:03:02.589 --> 01:03:02.599 align:start position:0%
um I can see employers deciding to use
 
01:03:05.329 --> 01:03:05.339 align:start position:0%
the the nine
 
01:03:08.089 --> 01:03:08.099 align:start position:0%
fire related rubber bands and the one
 
01:03:10.670 --> 01:03:10.680 align:start position:0%
reprimand that's unrelated and
 
01:03:13.250 --> 01:03:13.260 align:start position:0%
potentially to um take action against
 
01:03:15.770 --> 01:03:15.780 align:start position:0%
the employee that's how Progressive
 
01:03:17.210 --> 01:03:17.220 align:start position:0%
discipline Works
 
01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:18.530 align:start position:0%
discipline Works
um

01:03:18.530 --> 01:03:18.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:20.569 --> 01:03:20.579 align:start position:0%
so and uh you know we've had a
 
01:03:24.109 --> 01:03:24.119 align:start position:0%
discussion with uh the sponsor not the
 
01:03:26.750 --> 01:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
sponsor but um both the sponsor of the
 
01:03:29.390 --> 01:03:29.400 align:start position:0%
amendment that this isn't a union
 
01:03:31.910 --> 01:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
situation it very well could be a union
 
01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:33.650 align:start position:0%
situation it very well could be a union
situation

01:03:33.650 --> 01:03:33.660 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:03:36.109 --> 01:03:36.119 align:start position:0%
um we don't know what the job of these
 
01:03:38.390 --> 01:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
folks the the
 
01:03:40.549 --> 01:03:40.559 align:start position:0%
the paying job is compared to their
 
01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
firefighting job
 
01:03:43.970 --> 01:03:43.980 align:start position:0%
um many of them may
 
01:03:45.470 --> 01:03:45.480 align:start position:0%
um or at least some of them may be
 
01:03:49.250 --> 01:03:49.260 align:start position:0%
members of a union so um at any rate I'm
 
01:03:50.690 --> 01:03:50.700 align:start position:0%
not going to be supporting this uh
 
01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:52.849 align:start position:0%
not going to be supporting this uh
Amendment

01:03:52.849 --> 01:03:52.859 align:start position:0%

and Mr Vice chair yes
 
01:05:00.530 --> 01:05:00.540 align:start position:0%
that is a 10 to 10 vote
 
01:05:04.970 --> 01:05:04.980 align:start position:0%
so that Amendment does not pass uh
 
01:05:07.250 --> 01:05:07.260 align:start position:0%
representative infantine do you have a
 
01:05:09.770 --> 01:05:09.780 align:start position:0%
further amendment to bring forward I do
 
01:05:13.430 --> 01:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
not okay I think I I saw that
 
01:05:15.589 --> 01:05:15.599 align:start position:0%
representative Cahill may have a motion
 
01:05:18.650 --> 01:05:18.660 align:start position:0%
I think the proper order is because we
 
01:05:21.710 --> 01:05:21.720 align:start position:0%
have an OTP and no Amendment passed is
 
01:05:25.250 --> 01:05:25.260 align:start position:0%
that the next motion is the OTP with no
 
01:05:25.260 --> 01:05:27.890 align:start position:0%
that the next motion is the OTP with no
Amendment

01:05:27.890 --> 01:05:27.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:29.870 --> 01:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
um representative abalone
 
01:05:32.210 --> 01:05:32.220 align:start position:0%
did you have a community that option for
 
01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:35.390 align:start position:0%
did you have a community that option for
algebra

01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:36.470 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:05:38.450 --> 01:05:38.460 align:start position:0%
shall move Mr chairman
 
01:05:40.970 --> 01:05:40.980 align:start position:0%
second I didn't hear that so uh
 
01:05:43.010 --> 01:05:43.020 align:start position:0%
representative avalani moved the motion
 
01:05:50.270 --> 01:05:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
um so do we have could I get clarity if
 
01:05:57.589 --> 01:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
you OTP and if it ties you're dead if it
 
01:05:57.599 --> 01:05:58.690 align:start position:0%
you OTP and if it ties you're dead if it
ties

01:05:58.690 --> 01:05:58.700 align:start position:0%
ties
 
01:06:01.789 --> 01:06:01.799 align:start position:0%
still without recommendation at a
 
01:06:03.950 --> 01:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
further motion would be in order at that
 
01:06:05.510 --> 01:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
so would he be able to make a motion
 
01:06:09.289 --> 01:06:09.299 align:start position:0%
with them at that point uh
 
01:06:12.589 --> 01:06:12.599 align:start position:0%
right now and and I I probably should
 
01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
have asked I was not aware of any other
 
01:06:18.289 --> 01:06:18.299 align:start position:0%
amendments that had been prepared if I'm
 
01:06:20.870 --> 01:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
wrong in that please correct me
 
01:06:22.970 --> 01:06:22.980 align:start position:0%
um which is why we're voting on OTP with
 
01:06:27.049 --> 01:06:27.059 align:start position:0%
no Amendment if this also ties then I
 
01:06:29.750 --> 01:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
would look to representative Cahill
 
01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:30.950 align:start position:0%
would look to representative Cahill
um

01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
for a further motion to see if we had
 
01:06:36.109 --> 01:06:36.119 align:start position:0%
something that would get a majority
 
01:06:38.809 --> 01:06:38.819 align:start position:0%
of the members
 
01:06:41.990 --> 01:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
representative adjutant
 
01:06:43.910 --> 01:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chair can I defer to representative
 
01:06:45.410 --> 01:06:45.420 align:start position:0%
Sullivan first
 
01:06:47.450 --> 01:06:47.460 align:start position:0%
uh certainly representative Sullivan
 
01:06:49.069 --> 01:06:49.079 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:06:49.079 --> 01:06:50.450 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

01:06:50.450 --> 01:06:50.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:53.569 --> 01:06:53.579 align:start position:0%
I do believe this bill is ready to go
 
01:06:57.010 --> 01:06:57.020 align:start position:0%
um I I think it uh in its original form
 
01:07:01.010 --> 01:07:01.020 align:start position:0%
it does work it gives a job protection
 
01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
that uh these volunteers uh do need and
 
01:07:11.990 --> 01:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
I believe as presented this bill will
 
01:07:14.450 --> 01:07:14.460 align:start position:0%
work just fine and so I would like to
 
01:07:16.190 --> 01:07:16.200 align:start position:0%
see it uh pass
 
01:07:18.650 --> 01:07:18.660 align:start position:0%
OTP and go to the floor
 
01:07:21.529 --> 01:07:21.539 align:start position:0%
um as if presently uh
 
01:07:24.650 --> 01:07:24.660 align:start position:0%
exists thank you
 
01:07:27.410 --> 01:07:27.420 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman um
 
01:07:28.789 --> 01:07:28.799 align:start position:0%
I said it a couple times I'm going to
 
01:07:31.130 --> 01:07:31.140 align:start position:0%
say it again I am very impressed with
 
01:07:32.990 --> 01:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
how thoroughly this original bill was
 
01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.370 align:start position:0%
how thoroughly this original bill was
written

01:07:34.370 --> 01:07:34.380 align:start position:0%
written
 
01:07:36.349 --> 01:07:36.359 align:start position:0%
um it's very rare
 
01:07:39.589 --> 01:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
um that you get a bill that uh considers
 
01:07:42.049 --> 01:07:42.059 align:start position:0%
all contingencies and I wanna
 
01:07:45.410 --> 01:07:45.420 align:start position:0%
um give a shout out for the record to
 
01:07:46.970 --> 01:07:46.980 align:start position:0%
our heroes in the office of legislative
 
01:07:49.309 --> 01:07:49.319 align:start position:0%
Services who do this work they did a
 
01:07:51.170 --> 01:07:51.180 align:start position:0%
really good job on this one as
 
01:07:52.789 --> 01:07:52.799 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan alluded to this
 
01:07:55.130 --> 01:07:55.140 align:start position:0%
is a really uh good bill that's ready to
 
01:07:58.430 --> 01:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
go now it deals with the issue of
 
01:08:00.829 --> 01:08:00.839 align:start position:0%
progressive discipline uh leading
 
01:08:00.839 --> 01:08:02.630 align:start position:0%
progressive discipline uh leading
determination

01:08:02.630 --> 01:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
determination
 
01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:03.770 align:start position:0%
determination
um

01:08:03.770 --> 01:08:03.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:05.390 align:start position:0%
um
I

01:08:05.390 --> 01:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:08:09.170 --> 01:08:09.180 align:start position:0%
I don't know what amendment we couldn't
 
01:08:12.109 --> 01:08:12.119 align:start position:0%
make I I know there's hope that maybe
 
01:08:14.569 --> 01:08:14.579 align:start position:0%
there's some hypothetical Amendment
 
01:08:16.849 --> 01:08:16.859 align:start position:0%
um that could satisfy everybody
 
01:08:18.890 --> 01:08:18.900 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately I think that's you know
 
01:08:21.169 --> 01:08:21.179 align:start position:0%
the King Solomon Amendment
 
01:08:23.510 --> 01:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
um on a bill as delicate uh and as well
 
01:08:25.370 --> 01:08:25.380 align:start position:0%
prepared as this
 
01:08:25.380 --> 01:08:26.590 align:start position:0%
prepared as this
um

01:08:26.590 --> 01:08:26.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:29.150 --> 01:08:29.160 align:start position:0%
it just it has all the protections and
 
01:08:30.890 --> 01:08:30.900 align:start position:0%
uh I know everybody on the committee
 
01:08:33.289 --> 01:08:33.299 align:start position:0%
received an email last night from a
 
01:08:35.269 --> 01:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
gentleman named will Bateson uh will
 
01:08:37.370 --> 01:08:37.380 align:start position:0%
Bateson was a colleague of mine at 25th
 
01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
Marine headquarters or 25th Marine
 
01:08:41.150 --> 01:08:41.160 align:start position:0%
regiment headquarters company
 
01:08:43.910 --> 01:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
um we really are just providing the
 
01:08:45.650 --> 01:08:45.660 align:start position:0%
exact same standards that exist in
 
01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:47.689 align:start position:0%
exact same standards that exist in
userra

01:08:47.689 --> 01:08:47.699 align:start position:0%
userra
 
01:08:48.890 --> 01:08:48.900 align:start position:0%
um that already cover our service
 
01:08:50.150 --> 01:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
members like the ones that are failing
 
01:08:51.470 --> 01:08:51.480 align:start position:0%
in the state prison right now that's why
 
01:08:53.829 --> 01:08:53.839 align:start position:0%
this is so confounding to me because
 
01:08:55.970 --> 01:08:55.980 align:start position:0%
there's this belief that this is this
 
01:08:58.010 --> 01:08:58.020 align:start position:0%
brand new um set of Standards but in
 
01:08:59.990 --> 01:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
reality this is what our National Guard
 
01:09:02.390 --> 01:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
service members and uh Reserve members
 
01:09:04.849 --> 01:09:04.859 align:start position:0%
already operate under essentially
 
01:09:06.709 --> 01:09:06.719 align:start position:0%
um and I think that's great you know if
 
01:09:08.390 --> 01:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
there were more volunteer positions in
 
01:09:10.370 --> 01:09:10.380 align:start position:0%
our communities that would be uh
 
01:09:12.050 --> 01:09:12.060 align:start position:0%
coverable under this I would have
 
01:09:14.269 --> 01:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
submitted amendment to make it broader
 
01:09:17.990 --> 01:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
um but I think this is a great way
 
01:09:20.809 --> 01:09:20.819 align:start position:0%
um to encourage more volunteerism to
 
01:09:20.819 --> 01:09:22.130 align:start position:0%
um to encourage more volunteerism to
retain

01:09:22.130 --> 01:09:22.140 align:start position:0%
retain
 
01:09:24.650 --> 01:09:24.660 align:start position:0%
um to meet in the middle with the issue
 
01:09:26.209 --> 01:09:26.219 align:start position:0%
that representative McKenzie raised as
 
01:09:29.150 --> 01:09:29.160 align:start position:0%
far as funding for our departments
 
01:09:31.070 --> 01:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
um so I'm going to support the OTP I
 
01:09:33.470 --> 01:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
think this is ready to go uh and I look
 
01:09:35.150 --> 01:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
forward to a thorough discussion on the
 
01:09:36.470 --> 01:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
floor when this comes up in the next few
 
01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:38.510 align:start position:0%
floor when this comes up in the next few
weeks

01:09:38.510 --> 01:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
01:09:43.189 --> 01:09:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:45.410 --> 01:09:45.420 align:start position:0%
I'm not in favor of the opt to pass on
 
01:09:47.329 --> 01:09:47.339 align:start position:0%
this and I'm also not in favor of
 
01:09:49.849 --> 01:09:49.859 align:start position:0%
comparing this to our federal government
 
01:09:52.970 --> 01:09:52.980 align:start position:0%
military positions positions which do
 
01:09:55.790 --> 01:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
not have an option to decline the
 
01:09:58.669 --> 01:09:58.679 align:start position:0%
assignment that they're being um
 
01:10:01.310 --> 01:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
taken out of the workforce for so if our
 
01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:03.960 align:start position:0%
government is mandating that they must
 
01:10:06.650 --> 01:10:06.660 align:start position:0%
report to duty that's different than a
 
01:10:08.390 --> 01:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
volunteer firefighter where we do not
 
01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
have government mandates
 
01:10:12.830 --> 01:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
um so I don't believe that the two
 
01:10:14.630 --> 01:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
should be compared
 
01:10:16.669 --> 01:10:16.679 align:start position:0%
in this argument
 
01:10:17.990 --> 01:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:10:19.669 --> 01:10:19.679 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
01:10:19.679 --> 01:10:22.310 align:start position:0%
further discussion
representative

01:10:22.310 --> 01:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:10:24.590 --> 01:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
thank you I don't think the bill is
 
01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:25.970 align:start position:0%
thank you I don't think the bill is
ready

01:10:25.970 --> 01:10:25.980 align:start position:0%
ready
 
01:10:28.610 --> 01:10:28.620 align:start position:0%
no one has been fired that anyone can
 
01:10:29.630 --> 01:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
tell me
 
01:10:31.610 --> 01:10:31.620 align:start position:0%
or no one has been disciplined out of a
 
01:10:34.130 --> 01:10:34.140 align:start position:0%
job that anyone can tell me or show me
 
01:10:36.410 --> 01:10:36.420 align:start position:0%
since this bill has not been in place
 
01:10:36.420 --> 01:10:39.229 align:start position:0%
since this bill has not been in place
ever

01:10:39.229 --> 01:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:39.239 --> 01:10:40.970 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:10:40.970 --> 01:10:40.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:44.390 --> 01:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
you all know I grew up in a town
 
01:10:46.189 --> 01:10:46.199 align:start position:0%
with volunteer firefighters and I
 
01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
respect them immensely and I think
 
01:10:50.390 --> 01:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
they're a very valuable part but what
 
01:10:53.149 --> 01:10:53.159 align:start position:0%
really bothers me is the insult all the
 
01:10:53.159 --> 01:10:54.350 align:start position:0%
really bothers me is the insult all the
time

01:10:54.350 --> 01:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:10:56.149 --> 01:10:56.159 align:start position:0%
to some of the people in this committee
 
01:11:00.350 --> 01:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
that own businesses that we're rotten
 
01:11:02.030 --> 01:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
and we're not going to work with someone
 
01:11:04.550 --> 01:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
and we're not going to help
 
01:11:06.110 --> 01:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
yet you can never believe that an
 
01:11:08.209 --> 01:11:08.219 align:start position:0%
employee might abuse something
 
01:11:11.510 --> 01:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:14.149 --> 01:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
so I try to present something that's
 
01:11:17.570 --> 01:11:17.580 align:start position:0%
fair to both the employee and the
 
01:11:20.270 --> 01:11:20.280 align:start position:0%
employer but that's not good enough
 
01:11:22.370 --> 01:11:22.380 align:start position:0%
the employee needs
 
01:11:25.370 --> 01:11:25.380 align:start position:0%
whatever breath they want
 
01:11:27.470 --> 01:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
that's not right
 
01:11:31.370 --> 01:11:31.380 align:start position:0%
that's not fair to either one of them
 
01:11:35.090 --> 01:11:35.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:37.610 --> 01:11:37.620 align:start position:0%
I want to help
 
01:11:39.470 --> 01:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
this isn't the one to do it
 
01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:11:43.130 --> 01:11:43.140 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:11:45.590 --> 01:11:45.600 align:start position:0%

um
 
01:11:53.689 --> 01:11:53.699 align:start position:0%
just going to read section one uh really
 
01:11:56.750 --> 01:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
quick no employer shall discharge or
 
01:11:58.010 --> 01:11:58.020 align:start position:0%
take any other disciplinary action
 
01:11:59.750 --> 01:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
against an employee by reason a failure
 
01:12:02.209 --> 01:12:02.219 align:start position:0%
of such employee to report the work at
 
01:12:03.350 --> 01:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
the commencement of such employees
 
01:12:06.110 --> 01:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
regular working hours where the failure
 
01:12:07.850 --> 01:12:07.860 align:start position:0%
is due to the employees responding to an
 
01:12:10.370 --> 01:12:10.380 align:start position:0%
emergency in his or her capacity as a
 
01:12:11.750 --> 01:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
volunteer member of a fire department or
 
01:12:14.090 --> 01:12:14.100 align:start position:0%
ambulance department provided
 
01:12:17.390 --> 01:12:17.400 align:start position:0%
however that no such employer shall be
 
01:12:19.250 --> 01:12:19.260 align:start position:0%
required to compensate any such employee
 
01:12:20.930 --> 01:12:20.940 align:start position:0%
for any period of such employees normal
 
01:12:22.430 --> 01:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
working hours during which the reason
 
01:12:24.229 --> 01:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
for the employee's failure to report for
 
01:12:26.810 --> 01:12:26.820 align:start position:0%
work and at the request of the employer
 
01:12:29.630 --> 01:12:29.640 align:start position:0%
shall submit a statement signed by the
 
01:12:31.490 --> 01:12:31.500 align:start position:0%
chief of such fire department or
 
01:12:34.070 --> 01:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
ambulance department certifying the date
 
01:12:37.310 --> 01:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
and time such employee responded to and
 
01:12:39.470 --> 01:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
returned from the emergency such
 
01:12:41.750 --> 01:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
employees shall infer inform his or her
 
01:12:44.450 --> 01:12:44.460 align:start position:0%
employer or immediate supervisor of the
 
01:12:47.450 --> 01:12:47.460 align:start position:0%
reasons for the failure to report I
 
01:12:49.669 --> 01:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
think and I I'm going to say it for the
 
01:12:50.990 --> 01:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
fourth time and it's not just because
 
01:12:53.209 --> 01:12:53.219 align:start position:0%
you know I want to give you some Pat On
 
01:12:54.649 --> 01:12:54.659 align:start position:0%
The Backs
 
01:12:54.659 --> 01:12:55.310 align:start position:0%
The Backs
um

01:12:55.310 --> 01:12:55.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:57.890 --> 01:12:57.900 align:start position:0%
what we just heard as far as potential
 
01:13:01.610 --> 01:13:01.620 align:start position:0%
employee abuse of that policy is defined
 
01:13:04.250 --> 01:13:04.260 align:start position:0%
in here if the volunteer firefighter
 
01:13:07.370 --> 01:13:07.380 align:start position:0%
goes to Cumby's and hangs out for a few
 
01:13:07.380 --> 01:13:08.510 align:start position:0%
goes to Cumby's and hangs out for a few
hours

01:13:08.510 --> 01:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
hours
 
01:13:12.169 --> 01:13:12.179 align:start position:0%
and the employer says okay you know you
 
01:13:15.649 --> 01:13:15.659 align:start position:0%
were on a fire I would like a you know a
 
01:13:17.149 --> 01:13:17.159 align:start position:0%
written statement from your fire chief
 
01:13:18.890 --> 01:13:18.900 align:start position:0%
saying you were on that fire well guess
 
01:13:21.050 --> 01:13:21.060 align:start position:0%
what fire chief is not going to write
 
01:13:22.790 --> 01:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
that the employee was at a fire if they
 
01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:24.290 align:start position:0%
that the employee was at a fire if they
weren't

01:13:24.290 --> 01:13:24.300 align:start position:0%
weren't
 
01:13:27.110 --> 01:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
that's that's already that is so already
 
01:13:30.169 --> 01:13:30.179 align:start position:0%
well thoroughly fleshed out in this bill
 
01:13:31.490 --> 01:13:31.500 align:start position:0%
um I think it avoids those kind of
 
01:13:34.370 --> 01:13:34.380 align:start position:0%
situations so I I agree with
 
01:13:35.630 --> 01:13:35.640 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan I think it's
 
01:13:36.890 --> 01:13:36.900 align:start position:0%
ready to go
 
01:13:40.669 --> 01:13:40.679 align:start position:0%

01:15:21.010 --> 01:15:21.020 align:start position:0%

um and I see represent adjutant
 
01:15:33.770 --> 01:15:33.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I strongly oppose
 
01:15:35.209 --> 01:15:35.219 align:start position:0%
the retained motion
 
01:15:35.219 --> 01:15:36.050 align:start position:0%
the retained motion
um

01:15:36.050 --> 01:15:36.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:38.630 --> 01:15:38.640 align:start position:0%
that we we've tried we've had this bill
 
01:15:40.370 --> 01:15:40.380 align:start position:0%
for two months
 
01:15:41.510 --> 01:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
um I
 
01:15:43.610 --> 01:15:43.620 align:start position:0%
I don't think there's a magic Amendment
 
01:15:45.350 --> 01:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
that's going to make everybody happy uh
 
01:15:46.910 --> 01:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
and the fact of the matter is that in a
 
01:15:49.250 --> 01:15:49.260 align:start position:0%
situation like that I'm going to uh side
 
01:15:50.570 --> 01:15:50.580 align:start position:0%
with the rights and privileges of the
 
01:15:53.209 --> 01:15:53.219 align:start position:0%
volunteer firefighters and EMS workers
 
01:15:55.490 --> 01:15:55.500 align:start position:0%
um it's really disappointing uh I I
 
01:15:57.590 --> 01:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
think we've had uh ample time to
 
01:15:59.149 --> 01:15:59.159 align:start position:0%
negotiate and find a solution and we
 
01:16:01.010 --> 01:16:01.020 align:start position:0%
just haven't so
 
01:16:02.270 --> 01:16:02.280 align:start position:0%
um I don't know what holding on to this
 
01:16:04.550 --> 01:16:04.560 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chair

01:18:11.750 --> 01:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
um and I passed these amendments out uh
 
01:18:15.290 --> 01:18:15.300 align:start position:0%
at the outset of our gathering the
 
01:18:19.450 --> 01:18:19.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:26.810 --> 01:18:26.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:26.820 --> 01:18:32.450 align:start position:0%
 
m

01:18:32.450 --> 01:18:32.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:36.189 --> 01:18:36.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:40.669 --> 01:18:40.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:42.229 --> 01:18:42.239 align:start position:0%
moved by Sullivan second by
 
01:18:44.330 --> 01:18:44.340 align:start position:0%
representative attitude
 
01:18:46.010 --> 01:18:46.020 align:start position:0%
Mr representative Sullivan you're
 
01:18:48.770 --> 01:18:48.780 align:start position:0%
recognized speaker anymore thank you
 
01:18:48.780 --> 01:18:49.790 align:start position:0%
recognized speaker anymore thank you
um

01:18:49.790 --> 01:18:49.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:52.490 --> 01:18:52.500 align:start position:0%
when we originally
 
01:18:54.770 --> 01:18:54.780 align:start position:0%
um had the hearing for this bill
 
01:18:56.990 --> 01:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
um the uh
 
01:18:59.149 --> 01:18:59.159 align:start position:0%
sponsors and those supporting it were
 
01:19:01.370 --> 01:19:01.380 align:start position:0%
quick to say that the bill as uh
 
01:19:04.010 --> 01:19:04.020 align:start position:0%
originally presented was uh was flawed
 
01:19:05.990 --> 01:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
and needed to be amended
 
01:19:07.850 --> 01:19:07.860 align:start position:0%
um and so um
 
01:19:10.850 --> 01:19:10.860 align:start position:0%
the um it's actually been amended twice
 
01:19:12.410 --> 01:19:12.420 align:start position:0%
since then
 
01:19:14.930 --> 01:19:14.940 align:start position:0%
um the first time
 
01:19:18.590 --> 01:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
um the lines
 
01:19:22.490 --> 01:19:22.500 align:start position:0%
13 and 14 were inserted
 
01:19:25.189 --> 01:19:25.199 align:start position:0%
um which indicates that this section
 
01:19:27.229 --> 01:19:27.239 align:start position:0%
shall not apply in cases where this
 
01:19:29.209 --> 01:19:29.219 align:start position:0%
limitation conflicts with employers
 
01:19:30.890 --> 01:19:30.900 align:start position:0%
obligations under federal law or
 
01:19:34.550 --> 01:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
regulations or fulfilled or to fulfill a
 
01:19:36.910 --> 01:19:36.920 align:start position:0%
federal contract or licensing obligation
 
01:19:40.189 --> 01:19:40.199 align:start position:0%
and that addresses any concerns over the
 
01:19:42.070 --> 01:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
fact that this is
 
01:19:45.189 --> 01:19:45.199 align:start position:0%
technically not legal under federal law
 
01:19:49.070 --> 01:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
so the people who are you know have for
 
01:19:51.530 --> 01:19:51.540 align:start position:0%
example a trucking driver's license
 
01:19:51.540 --> 01:19:54.530 align:start position:0%
example a trucking driver's license
would

01:19:54.530 --> 01:19:54.540 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:19:58.070 --> 01:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
it would this would not apply to them
 
01:20:01.689 --> 01:20:01.699 align:start position:0%
in other similar Federal um
 
01:20:04.250 --> 01:20:04.260 align:start position:0%
employment or federally licensed
 
01:20:04.260 --> 01:20:05.689 align:start position:0%
employment or federally licensed
employment

01:20:05.689 --> 01:20:05.699 align:start position:0%
employment
 
01:20:05.699 --> 01:20:06.649 align:start position:0%
employment
um

01:20:06.649 --> 01:20:06.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:10.750 --> 01:20:10.760 align:start position:0%
lines 15 and 16 were added at our last
 
01:20:14.229 --> 01:20:14.239 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting and that
 
01:20:17.090 --> 01:20:17.100 align:start position:0%
that section reads this section shall
 
01:20:19.010 --> 01:20:19.020 align:start position:0%
not apply to employees of Emergency
 
01:20:21.770 --> 01:20:21.780 align:start position:0%
Medical Services law enforcement Public
 
01:20:24.189 --> 01:20:24.199 align:start position:0%
Safety officials in firefighter services
 
01:20:27.790 --> 01:20:27.800 align:start position:0%
so this brings those
 
01:20:31.970 --> 01:20:31.980 align:start position:0%
first responder type employment
 
01:20:31.980 --> 01:20:32.689 align:start position:0%
first responder type employment
um

01:20:32.689 --> 01:20:32.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:34.970 --> 01:20:34.980 align:start position:0%
it excludes them from
 
01:20:37.130 --> 01:20:37.140 align:start position:0%
um from this bill
 
01:20:40.570 --> 01:20:40.580 align:start position:0%
so the um those are the two substantial
 
01:20:44.630 --> 01:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
changes that the amendment brings what
 
01:20:48.350 --> 01:20:48.360 align:start position:0%
the bill itself does is it um assures
 
01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:50.390 align:start position:0%
the bill itself does is it um assures
that

01:20:50.390 --> 01:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:20:53.050 --> 01:20:53.060 align:start position:0%
no employee will be
 
01:20:55.669 --> 01:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
disciplined or discharged
 
01:20:59.209 --> 01:20:59.219 align:start position:0%
solely because they have a medical
 
01:21:00.669 --> 01:21:00.679 align:start position:0%
um a
 
01:21:03.470 --> 01:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
therapeutic canvas card
 
01:21:05.630 --> 01:21:05.640 align:start position:0%
um or because they
 
01:21:08.750 --> 01:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
um they test positive for THC
 
01:21:11.209 --> 01:21:11.219 align:start position:0%
what we heard in testimony is that THC
 
01:21:14.270 --> 01:21:14.280 align:start position:0%
remains in a person's system for for
 
01:21:17.450 --> 01:21:17.460 align:start position:0%
many many days after any type of usage
 
01:21:20.149 --> 01:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
whether it's recreational or therapeutic
 
01:21:24.470 --> 01:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
so essentially testing positive for THC
 
01:21:27.290 --> 01:21:27.300 align:start position:0%
simply indicates that sometime in the
 
01:21:29.990 --> 01:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
not too distant past but not necessarily
 
01:21:33.590 --> 01:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
recent the person person has used
 
01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:35.330 align:start position:0%
recent the person person has used
cannabis

01:21:35.330 --> 01:21:35.340 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
01:21:35.340 --> 01:21:36.050 align:start position:0%
cannabis
um

01:21:36.050 --> 01:21:36.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:38.390 --> 01:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
testimony was also very clear that the
 
01:21:41.810 --> 01:21:41.820 align:start position:0%
objective with therapeutic cannabis is
 
01:21:44.450 --> 01:21:44.460 align:start position:0%
not to become intoxicated it's to deal
 
01:21:47.470 --> 01:21:47.480 align:start position:0%
with the symptoms that are qualifying
 
01:21:51.050 --> 01:21:51.060 align:start position:0%
under the under the law
 
01:21:51.060 --> 01:21:52.250 align:start position:0%
under the under the law
um

01:21:52.250 --> 01:21:52.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:55.070 --> 01:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:21:57.590 --> 01:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
it's important to note that there aren't
 
01:21:59.750 --> 01:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
that many people that have a therapeutic
 
01:22:01.370 --> 01:22:01.380 align:start position:0%
a cannabis card
 
01:22:03.729 --> 01:22:03.739 align:start position:0%
many of the people who have the card
 
01:22:05.930 --> 01:22:05.940 align:start position:0%
aren't working
 
01:22:07.970 --> 01:22:07.980 align:start position:0%
um so there's only a certain number who
 
01:22:09.770 --> 01:22:09.780 align:start position:0%
are employed so the number of people
 
01:22:11.930 --> 01:22:11.940 align:start position:0%
that this actually applies to is not
 
01:22:11.940 --> 01:22:13.310 align:start position:0%
that this actually applies to is not
huge

01:22:13.310 --> 01:22:13.320 align:start position:0%
huge
 
01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:14.030 align:start position:0%
huge
um

01:22:14.030 --> 01:22:14.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:15.470 --> 01:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
but it is important to give them that
 
01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:16.990 align:start position:0%
but it is important to give them that
protection

01:22:16.990 --> 01:22:17.000 align:start position:0%
protection
 
01:22:20.090 --> 01:22:20.100 align:start position:0%
and frankly it's protection that they
 
01:22:22.310 --> 01:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
already have
 
01:22:24.709 --> 01:22:24.719 align:start position:0%
this this New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
01:22:27.729 --> 01:22:27.739 align:start position:0%
has decided that someone who is in the
 
01:22:32.030 --> 01:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program is entitled
 
01:22:36.430 --> 01:22:36.440 align:start position:0%
to accommodation in the workplace
 
01:22:39.530 --> 01:22:39.540 align:start position:0%
that's been made clear what this bill
 
01:22:42.290 --> 01:22:42.300 align:start position:0%
does is it takes that Supreme Court
 
01:22:45.410 --> 01:22:45.420 align:start position:0%
decision and it puts it into statute
 
01:22:47.390 --> 01:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
so that someone doesn't have to go to
 
01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:49.370 align:start position:0%
so that someone doesn't have to go to
court

01:22:49.370 --> 01:22:49.380 align:start position:0%
court
 
01:22:51.229 --> 01:22:51.239 align:start position:0%
um paying all the expenses that are
 
01:22:54.229 --> 01:22:54.239 align:start position:0%
involved there in order to secure those
 
01:22:57.290 --> 01:22:57.300 align:start position:0%
rights so um
 
01:22:59.689 --> 01:22:59.699 align:start position:0%
this is not something new this is
 
01:23:01.490 --> 01:23:01.500 align:start position:0%
something that the Supreme Court says
 
01:23:03.950 --> 01:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
people are entitled to
 
01:23:07.790 --> 01:23:07.800 align:start position:0%
um a lot of work has gone into this and
 
01:23:10.070 --> 01:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
I firmly believe that this is a bill
 
01:23:13.490 --> 01:23:13.500 align:start position:0%
um well worth supporting I would also
 
01:23:16.390 --> 01:23:16.400 align:start position:0%
um point out that I handed out earlier
 
01:23:19.729 --> 01:23:19.739 align:start position:0%
chapter 126x
 
01:23:23.530 --> 01:23:23.540 align:start position:0%
that is the therapeutic cannabis statute
 
01:23:29.390 --> 01:23:29.400 align:start position:0%
it's very important to read 126 x along
 
01:23:34.310 --> 01:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
with the bill because 126x already puts
 
01:23:37.370 --> 01:23:37.380 align:start position:0%
a lot of restrictions on an employee
 
01:23:39.229 --> 01:23:39.239 align:start position:0%
who's in this program
 
01:23:43.970 --> 01:23:43.980 align:start position:0%
an employee for example cannot
 
01:23:43.980 --> 01:23:45.130 align:start position:0%
an employee for example cannot
um

01:23:45.130 --> 01:23:45.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:49.430 --> 01:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
be under the influence of THC without
 
01:23:52.550 --> 01:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
written permission from the employer
 
01:23:55.729 --> 01:23:55.739 align:start position:0%
an employee cannot have cannabis at the
 
01:23:58.850 --> 01:23:58.860 align:start position:0%
work site without written permission
 
01:24:00.350 --> 01:24:00.360 align:start position:0%
from the employer
 
01:24:02.510 --> 01:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
many of the people people in this
 
01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:03.610 align:start position:0%
many of the people people in this
program

01:24:03.610 --> 01:24:03.620 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:24:07.430 --> 01:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
don't intend or need to use cannabis
 
01:24:11.270 --> 01:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
while at work many people use it to for
 
01:24:16.189 --> 01:24:16.199 align:start position:0%
example deal with pain at night so they
 
01:24:17.510 --> 01:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
can get a good night's sleep and be
 
01:24:20.050 --> 01:24:20.060 align:start position:0%
effective at work the next day
 
01:24:23.390 --> 01:24:23.400 align:start position:0%
and so it's
 
01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:25.010 align:start position:0%
and so it's
it's

01:24:25.010 --> 01:24:25.020 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:24:28.810 --> 01:24:28.820 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of restrictions in 126x
 
01:24:35.689 --> 01:24:35.699 align:start position:0%
that back up this uh this bill so um
 
01:24:37.510 --> 01:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
I think this bill is
 
01:24:39.530 --> 01:24:39.540 align:start position:0%
advantageous for the people who need it
 
01:24:48.470 --> 01:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:54.169 --> 01:24:54.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:57.229 --> 01:24:57.239 align:start position:0%
I am not in favor of this amendment due
 
01:24:59.330 --> 01:24:59.340 align:start position:0%
to three words the focus on the
 
01:25:01.250 --> 01:25:01.260 align:start position:0%
conversation seems to always go to
 
01:25:03.290 --> 01:25:03.300 align:start position:0%
terminate and disciplinary action of an
 
01:25:05.270 --> 01:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
employee and what we seem to leave out
 
01:25:06.890 --> 01:25:06.900 align:start position:0%
in a lot of our conversations are the
 
01:25:10.070 --> 01:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
three words that are deny employment to
 
01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:11.570 align:start position:0%
three words that are deny employment to
and

01:25:11.570 --> 01:25:11.580 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:25:14.510 --> 01:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
well I can understand the part about an
 
01:25:15.890 --> 01:25:15.900 align:start position:0%
existing employee
 
01:25:17.750 --> 01:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
if I work at a company and my employer
 
01:25:20.030 --> 01:25:20.040 align:start position:0%
knows what my work ethic is what my
 
01:25:22.490 --> 01:25:22.500 align:start position:0%
behavior is and they see that there's a
 
01:25:24.050 --> 01:25:24.060 align:start position:0%
change in me because of my use of
 
01:25:26.810 --> 01:25:26.820 align:start position:0%
cannabis then I can understand that
 
01:25:29.689 --> 01:25:29.699 align:start position:0%
this business about being able to not
 
01:25:32.390 --> 01:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
being able to deny employment is
 
01:25:34.070 --> 01:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
completely different an interview
 
01:25:36.590 --> 01:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
process you're getting the best of that
 
01:25:38.270 --> 01:25:38.280 align:start position:0%
employee presumably during an interview
 
01:25:40.669 --> 01:25:40.679 align:start position:0%
process and you're taking somebody on
 
01:25:42.530 --> 01:25:42.540 align:start position:0%
good faith
 
01:25:45.470 --> 01:25:45.480 align:start position:0%
an offer for employment
 
01:25:48.110 --> 01:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
is usually contingent upon passing of a
 
01:25:49.669 --> 01:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
drug screening for those companies that
 
01:25:52.790 --> 01:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
do drug screening not every company does
 
01:25:54.830 --> 01:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
but most I don't know of a single
 
01:25:56.570 --> 01:25:56.580 align:start position:0%
company that does drug screening before
 
01:25:58.610 --> 01:25:58.620 align:start position:0%
that offer is is offered out there
 
01:26:01.550 --> 01:26:01.560 align:start position:0%
because if they start drug screening the
 
01:26:03.830 --> 01:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
candidates that are applying they have
 
01:26:05.870 --> 01:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
to drug screen every candidate that is
 
01:26:07.490 --> 01:26:07.500 align:start position:0%
applying you can't pick and choose
 
01:26:10.010 --> 01:26:10.020 align:start position:0%
candidates however when the job offer is
 
01:26:12.169 --> 01:26:12.179 align:start position:0%
out you can choose to make that job
 
01:26:16.430 --> 01:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
offer contingent upon a drug screen
 
01:26:19.129 --> 01:26:19.139 align:start position:0%
this bill does not exclude electricians
 
01:26:21.110 --> 01:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
it does not exclude any other high risk
 
01:26:23.149 --> 01:26:23.159 align:start position:0%
positions we've been told to go back to
 
01:26:26.090 --> 01:26:26.100 align:start position:0%
chapter 126x and look at what the
 
01:26:27.830 --> 01:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
exemptions are there however the
 
01:26:31.850 --> 01:26:31.860 align:start position:0%
exemptions here under under 126 x 3
 
01:26:33.770 --> 01:26:33.780 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral two
 
01:26:36.050 --> 01:26:36.060 align:start position:0%
they exempt any person from arrest or
 
01:26:38.149 --> 01:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
prosecution for being under the
 
01:26:39.530 --> 01:26:39.540 align:start position:0%
influence during operating a motor
 
01:26:41.450 --> 01:26:41.460 align:start position:0%
vehicle so on and so forth but they
 
01:26:43.610 --> 01:26:43.620 align:start position:0%
don't talk about the employer's rights
 
01:26:45.649 --> 01:26:45.659 align:start position:0%
during this or the employees rights
 
01:26:47.390 --> 01:26:47.400 align:start position:0%
during this this is just from arrest and
 
01:26:49.729 --> 01:26:49.739 align:start position:0%
prosecution so you know we refer to
 
01:26:52.370 --> 01:26:52.380 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral two as items that are
 
01:26:54.590 --> 01:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
detailed that are excluded from this
 
01:26:56.870 --> 01:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
that is actually not in the workforce
 
01:27:00.110 --> 01:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
that's from arrest or prosecution
 
01:27:04.070 --> 01:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
so I believe that we should at the very
 
01:27:06.410 --> 01:27:06.420 align:start position:0%
minimum be removing the words deny
 
01:27:08.270 --> 01:27:08.280 align:start position:0%
employment to and allow the employers
 
01:27:10.970 --> 01:27:10.980 align:start position:0%
the option to make their own decisions
 
01:27:13.790 --> 01:27:13.800 align:start position:0%
and if an employer does get a drug
 
01:27:15.709 --> 01:27:15.719 align:start position:0%
screen back that does come back positive
 
01:27:17.750 --> 01:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
for cannabis they should be entitled to
 
01:27:20.030 --> 01:27:20.040 align:start position:0%
the right to sit down and talk with that
 
01:27:22.550 --> 01:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
employee potential employee find out
 
01:27:24.290 --> 01:27:24.300 align:start position:0%
what the circumstances are and to be
 
01:27:26.330 --> 01:27:26.340 align:start position:0%
able to make a decision accordingly
 
01:27:28.310 --> 01:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
and if I'm the employer which I have
 
01:27:30.830 --> 01:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
been the employer of electricians an
 
01:27:33.290 --> 01:27:33.300 align:start position:0%
electrician comes back positive for drug
 
01:27:36.050 --> 01:27:36.060 align:start position:0%
screening I'm not hiring him the risk is
 
01:27:38.090 --> 01:27:38.100 align:start position:0%
too great the risk is too great to my
 
01:27:39.770 --> 01:27:39.780 align:start position:0%
workers comp the risk is too great to
 
01:27:41.930 --> 01:27:41.940 align:start position:0%
him personally the risk is too great to
 
01:27:44.090 --> 01:27:44.100 align:start position:0%
the job I don't think it's a responsible
 
01:27:45.950 --> 01:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
thing to do and that's the decision that
 
01:27:48.070 --> 01:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
I've made as an employer hiring several
 
01:27:50.270 --> 01:27:50.280 align:start position:0%
electricians and HVAC service
 
01:27:52.970 --> 01:27:52.980 align:start position:0%
technicians so I'm not in favor of this
 
01:27:52.980 --> 01:27:56.649 align:start position:0%
technicians so I'm not in favor of this
amendment

01:27:56.649 --> 01:27:56.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:00.649 --> 01:28:00.659 align:start position:0%
I concur with representative colcum I I
 
01:28:03.530 --> 01:28:03.540 align:start position:0%
spoke with the attorney from the uh the
 
01:28:05.810 --> 01:28:05.820 align:start position:0%
insurance commissioner's office and uh
 
01:28:07.790 --> 01:28:07.800 align:start position:0%
although they don't have a position on
 
01:28:10.189 --> 01:28:10.199 align:start position:0%
the bill he sees a lot of these these
 
01:28:13.490 --> 01:28:13.500 align:start position:0%
Insurance problems you know surfacing uh
 
01:28:15.229 --> 01:28:15.239 align:start position:0%
in the future they haven't happened in
 
01:28:16.610 --> 01:28:16.620 align:start position:0%
any other state yet
 
01:28:20.030 --> 01:28:20.040 align:start position:0%
and the key word he said it is yet
 
01:28:22.370 --> 01:28:22.380 align:start position:0%
um you know when If an employer says
 
01:28:25.970 --> 01:28:25.980 align:start position:0%
it's it's okay for you to you know be to
 
01:28:28.790 --> 01:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
have cannabis or or you know not be able
 
01:28:32.270 --> 01:28:32.280 align:start position:0%
to pass a a test and say let's let's
 
01:28:34.629 --> 01:28:34.639 align:start position:0%
take a warehouse position for instance
 
01:28:37.610 --> 01:28:37.620 align:start position:0%
somebody can use a two-wheeler and move
 
01:28:39.470 --> 01:28:39.480 align:start position:0%
cases of stuff around
 
01:28:41.750 --> 01:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
but when he hops on a forklift
 
01:28:43.850 --> 01:28:43.860 align:start position:0%
you know to move something and he
 
01:28:46.729 --> 01:28:46.739 align:start position:0%
smashes into a into a a rack that's that
 
01:28:48.470 --> 01:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
goes 20 feet high and that things start
 
01:28:50.209 --> 01:28:50.219 align:start position:0%
uh tumbling down
 
01:28:50.219 --> 01:28:51.050 align:start position:0%
uh tumbling down
um

01:28:51.050 --> 01:28:51.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:53.629 --> 01:28:53.639 align:start position:0%
you know and he's he's our the employer
 
01:28:57.189 --> 01:28:57.199 align:start position:0%
has given him permission to work there
 
01:28:59.990 --> 01:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
on its nest where uh we could be we
 
01:29:02.270 --> 01:29:02.280 align:start position:0%
could be dealing with here and uh you
 
01:29:04.070 --> 01:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
know the The Eternity at the attorney
 
01:29:06.590 --> 01:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
more or less brought that up
 
01:29:09.050 --> 01:29:09.060 align:start position:0%
um you know workers comp once again you
 
01:29:11.990 --> 01:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
know representative colcum talked about
 
01:29:15.050 --> 01:29:15.060 align:start position:0%
the uh the the uh the ramifications
 
01:29:15.060 --> 01:29:16.430 align:start position:0%
the uh the the uh the ramifications
there

01:29:16.430 --> 01:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:29:18.649 --> 01:29:18.659 align:start position:0%
um you know it we could be opening up a
 
01:29:21.050 --> 01:29:21.060 align:start position:0%
real nasty can of worms here uh the
 
01:29:22.910 --> 01:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
employer once again would take an
 
01:29:24.770 --> 01:29:24.780 align:start position:0%
employer's rights away you know they're
 
01:29:26.629 --> 01:29:26.639 align:start position:0%
the ones with the investment you know
 
01:29:28.910 --> 01:29:28.920 align:start position:0%
many of them have you know have scrapped
 
01:29:30.770 --> 01:29:30.780 align:start position:0%
and saved and worked 20 hours a day and
 
01:29:32.450 --> 01:29:32.460 align:start position:0%
all the rest of it to build these
 
01:29:33.590 --> 01:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
businesses and now we're going to take
 
01:29:37.189 --> 01:29:37.199 align:start position:0%
rights away I I think that's wrong and
 
01:29:39.950 --> 01:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
uh you know uh
 
01:29:41.450 --> 01:29:41.460 align:start position:0%
I uh
 
01:29:44.510 --> 01:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
I'm all for the uh the you know cannabis
 
01:29:47.209 --> 01:29:47.219 align:start position:0%
as far as a uh as far as pain meds and
 
01:29:49.790 --> 01:29:49.800 align:start position:0%
what have you but um you know we can't
 
01:29:52.370 --> 01:29:52.380 align:start position:0%
be taking employers rights away plain
 
01:29:54.110 --> 01:29:54.120 align:start position:0%
and simple you know they've got to have
 
01:29:55.970 --> 01:29:55.980 align:start position:0%
to laugh the last say
 
01:29:58.610 --> 01:29:58.620 align:start position:0%
you know um if um if they don't want
 
01:30:00.350 --> 01:30:00.360 align:start position:0%
somebody that that can't pass a drug
 
01:30:02.990 --> 01:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
drug screen that's that's their business
 
01:30:05.330 --> 01:30:05.340 align:start position:0%
and um you know they're the ones that
 
01:30:06.470 --> 01:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
are going to take the fall for it
 
01:30:08.090 --> 01:30:08.100 align:start position:0%
they're the one and the bottom line is
 
01:30:10.790 --> 01:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
you know the we uh we always blame the
 
01:30:13.430 --> 01:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
guy at the top the guy at the top is the
 
01:30:15.350 --> 01:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
employer in this case we can't do this
 
01:30:19.430 --> 01:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:23.090 --> 01:30:23.100 align:start position:0%
lo and behold before us stands another
 
01:30:26.090 --> 01:30:26.100 align:start position:0%
well-written Amendment
 
01:30:28.790 --> 01:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
um as was written or as was said
 
01:30:31.070 --> 01:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
um the three words deny employment two I
 
01:30:32.689 --> 01:30:32.699 align:start position:0%
would like to direct everybody's
 
01:30:34.910 --> 01:30:34.920 align:start position:0%
attention to the one word in line eight
 
01:30:38.689 --> 01:30:38.699 align:start position:0%
which is the word solely
 
01:30:42.950 --> 01:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
as with most discrimination law you are
 
01:30:45.770 --> 01:30:45.780 align:start position:0%
allowed to not hire somebody from a
 
01:30:48.410 --> 01:30:48.420 align:start position:0%
protected class if that person has a
 
01:30:49.850 --> 01:30:49.860 align:start position:0%
criminal record
 
01:30:53.629 --> 01:30:53.639 align:start position:0%
you are allowed to not hire
 
01:30:55.729 --> 01:30:55.739 align:start position:0%
um a person of a projected race class or
 
01:30:57.830 --> 01:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
a protected gender class if there are
 
01:31:01.790 --> 01:31:01.800 align:start position:0%
other things in that person's resume
 
01:31:04.610 --> 01:31:04.620 align:start position:0%
that would preclude them from working
 
01:31:04.620 --> 01:31:05.750 align:start position:0%
that would preclude them from working
however

01:31:05.750 --> 01:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:31:09.229 --> 01:31:09.239 align:start position:0%
their race or their gender cannot be the
 
01:31:12.590 --> 01:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
sole reason why you don't hire them and
 
01:31:13.790 --> 01:31:13.800 align:start position:0%
that is exactly how this
 
01:31:15.470 --> 01:31:15.480 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination language before us
 
01:31:20.209 --> 01:31:20.219 align:start position:0%
is written if a person comes in
 
01:31:22.970 --> 01:31:22.980 align:start position:0%
um obviously impaired
 
01:31:22.980 --> 01:31:23.689 align:start position:0%
um obviously impaired
um

01:31:23.689 --> 01:31:23.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:26.990 --> 01:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
you are allowed to not hire that person
 
01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:27.709 align:start position:0%
you are allowed to not hire that person
um

01:31:27.709 --> 01:31:27.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:30.010 --> 01:31:30.020 align:start position:0%
this bill and this amendment
 
01:31:32.990 --> 01:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
specifically pertains to people who want
 
01:31:35.450 --> 01:31:35.460 align:start position:0%
to work and I want to make that as clear
 
01:31:38.229 --> 01:31:38.239 align:start position:0%
as possible this is an enabling
 
01:31:41.570 --> 01:31:41.580 align:start position:0%
Amendment for individuals who wants to
 
01:31:44.450 --> 01:31:44.460 align:start position:0%
be able to provide for themselves to
 
01:31:47.750 --> 01:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
have that opportunity to do so
 
01:31:51.410 --> 01:31:51.420 align:start position:0%
um I also want to read line 17 and 18
 
01:31:53.330 --> 01:31:53.340 align:start position:0%
because I think this is very important
 
01:31:55.370 --> 01:31:55.380 align:start position:0%
to the last speaker's comments nothing
 
01:31:57.169 --> 01:31:57.179 align:start position:0%
in this section shall be construed to
 
01:31:59.090 --> 01:31:59.100 align:start position:0%
require an employer to allow being
 
01:32:01.250 --> 01:32:01.260 align:start position:0%
impaired by cannabis products while at
 
01:32:01.260 --> 01:32:02.770 align:start position:0%
impaired by cannabis products while at
work

01:32:02.770 --> 01:32:02.780 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:32:05.270 --> 01:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
in a hypothetical scenario where
 
01:32:07.669 --> 01:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
somebody is driving you know a fork lift
 
01:32:09.649 --> 01:32:09.659 align:start position:0%
and they're obviously messed up the
 
01:32:12.050 --> 01:32:12.060 align:start position:0%
employer can the employer can let them
 
01:32:14.870 --> 01:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
go the employer can send them home that
 
01:32:16.970 --> 01:32:16.980 align:start position:0%
is not protected under this I we had the
 
01:32:18.470 --> 01:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
same discussion in the public hearing
 
01:32:20.629 --> 01:32:20.639 align:start position:0%
where we looked at the original context
 
01:32:22.490 --> 01:32:22.500 align:start position:0%
of the bill and folks would say well you
 
01:32:23.689 --> 01:32:23.699 align:start position:0%
know what if you smoke something at
 
01:32:24.709 --> 01:32:24.719 align:start position:0%
lunch and then you climb up the
 
01:32:26.330 --> 01:32:26.340 align:start position:0%
scaffolding that was not allowed in the
 
01:32:28.850 --> 01:32:28.860 align:start position:0%
original version of the bill the
 
01:32:32.090 --> 01:32:32.100 align:start position:0%
I I would the two big things that I
 
01:32:33.350 --> 01:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
would take away from this amendment and
 
01:32:35.270 --> 01:32:35.280 align:start position:0%
why I'm going to uh very much support
 
01:32:38.330 --> 01:32:38.340 align:start position:0%
them are line eight uh solely because
 
01:32:41.510 --> 01:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
and then the issues uh and then 17 and
 
01:32:43.430 --> 01:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
18 provide very good protections to make
 
01:32:44.990 --> 01:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
sure that there are no safety issues at
 
01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:46.129 align:start position:0%
sure that there are no safety issues at
work

01:32:46.129 --> 01:32:46.139 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:32:46.139 --> 01:32:46.790 align:start position:0%
work
um

01:32:46.790 --> 01:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:48.350 --> 01:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
where an employee is not allowed to be
 
01:32:50.930 --> 01:32:50.940 align:start position:0%
impaired again for the record nothing in
 
01:32:52.250 --> 01:32:52.260 align:start position:0%
this section shall be construed to
 
01:32:53.750 --> 01:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
require an employer to allow being
 
01:32:55.490 --> 01:32:55.500 align:start position:0%
impaired by cannabis products while at
 
01:32:57.590 --> 01:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
work I will be supporting this amendment
 
01:33:02.030 --> 01:33:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:04.550 --> 01:33:04.560 align:start position:0%
if you have a question of the uh
 
01:33:08.689 --> 01:33:08.699 align:start position:0%
Amendment author I do and while I agree
 
01:33:10.610 --> 01:33:10.620 align:start position:0%
with several of the previous speakers
 
01:33:14.570 --> 01:33:14.580 align:start position:0%
points I never want to take
 
01:33:17.510 --> 01:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh on face value that Amendment must be
 
01:33:19.970 --> 01:33:19.980 align:start position:0%
perfect and I'm I'm concerned about one
 
01:33:22.490 --> 01:33:22.500 align:start position:0%
word in here and somebody who was part
 
01:33:24.530 --> 01:33:24.540 align:start position:0%
of the drafting maybe can explain it to
 
01:33:24.540 --> 01:33:25.850 align:start position:0%
of the drafting maybe can explain it to
me

01:33:25.850 --> 01:33:25.860 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:33:28.970 --> 01:33:28.980 align:start position:0%
um section one A and B are separated by
 
01:33:34.490 --> 01:33:34.500 align:start position:0%
the word or uh which to me that means
 
01:33:36.310 --> 01:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
that it's either
 
01:33:41.090 --> 01:33:41.100 align:start position:0%
a or b independent of each other and to
 
01:33:43.250 --> 01:33:43.260 align:start position:0%
me it would seem like the intent is an
 
01:33:46.370 --> 01:33:46.380 align:start position:0%
and that you're trying to
 
01:33:49.669 --> 01:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
um protect someone who tests positive
 
01:33:53.629 --> 01:33:53.639 align:start position:0%
while they have a card not test positive
 
01:33:57.709 --> 01:33:57.719 align:start position:0%
or have a card so if someone's familiar
 
01:33:59.810 --> 01:33:59.820 align:start position:0%
with this language more than I am and
 
01:33:59.820 --> 01:34:01.370 align:start position:0%
with this language more than I am and
understands

01:34:01.370 --> 01:34:01.380 align:start position:0%
understands
 
01:34:03.890 --> 01:34:03.900 align:start position:0%
how it's constructed if you could
 
01:34:05.510 --> 01:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
explain it I would appreciate it
 
01:34:08.209 --> 01:34:08.219 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan
 
01:34:11.209 --> 01:34:11.219 align:start position:0%
I think it's important to look at the um
 
01:34:14.270 --> 01:34:14.280 align:start position:0%
lines six through eight in conjunction
 
01:34:16.850 --> 01:34:16.860 align:start position:0%
with that because lines six through
 
01:34:19.010 --> 01:34:19.020 align:start position:0%
eight indicates that the person is a
 
01:34:21.649 --> 01:34:21.659 align:start position:0%
qualifying patient who possesses a
 
01:34:24.169 --> 01:34:24.179 align:start position:0%
current valid registry identification
 
01:34:29.930 --> 01:34:29.940 align:start position:0%
card so um so basically that means that
 
01:34:29.940 --> 01:34:31.189 align:start position:0%
card so um so basically that means that
um

01:34:31.189 --> 01:34:31.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:35.030 --> 01:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
everyone involved with A or B is a um
 
01:34:38.870 --> 01:34:38.880 align:start position:0%
someone who holds the card so section B
 
01:34:41.629 --> 01:34:41.639 align:start position:0%
where the individual has a positive drug
 
01:34:44.510 --> 01:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
test that individual is part of the
 
01:34:46.910 --> 01:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program
 
01:34:50.149 --> 01:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
um so um frankly I had the same
 
01:34:53.090 --> 01:34:53.100 align:start position:0%
difficulty at one point if you read a
 
01:34:54.229 --> 01:34:54.239 align:start position:0%
and b
 
01:34:58.070 --> 01:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
um in isolation it the or is a bit
 
01:34:59.930 --> 01:34:59.940 align:start position:0%
troubling but if you read it in
 
01:35:03.050 --> 01:35:03.060 align:start position:0%
conjunction with um lines of six through
 
01:35:06.770 --> 01:35:06.780 align:start position:0%
eight it the problem is solved
 
01:35:09.110 --> 01:35:09.120 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to thank the representative
 
01:35:12.910 --> 01:35:12.920 align:start position:0%
for that explanation and for the uh
 
01:35:16.129 --> 01:35:16.139 align:start position:0%
understanding that we we were both had
 
01:35:18.830 --> 01:35:18.840 align:start position:0%
the same issue I I do understand and and
 
01:35:22.209 --> 01:35:22.219 align:start position:0%
stand corrected thank you
 
01:35:25.250 --> 01:35:25.260 align:start position:0%
followed by love
 
01:35:30.110 --> 01:35:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:34.970 --> 01:35:34.980 align:start position:0%
I have doubts with this uh Bill the
 
01:35:38.350 --> 01:35:38.360 align:start position:0%
before I retired I worked in a
 
01:35:41.810 --> 01:35:41.820 align:start position:0%
lumber department of a big box store
 
01:35:45.350 --> 01:35:45.360 align:start position:0%
okay and in this lumber department you
 
01:35:49.370 --> 01:35:49.380 align:start position:0%
moved around a lot of heavy material and
 
01:35:52.850 --> 01:35:52.860 align:start position:0%
a lot of times this took teamwork you
 
01:35:56.890 --> 01:35:56.900 align:start position:0%
had two people working with you to
 
01:35:59.770 --> 01:35:59.780 align:start position:0%
coordinate the movement of this material
 
01:36:04.550 --> 01:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
and as with firemen and as with a lot of
 
01:36:08.270 --> 01:36:08.280 align:start position:0%
other things they rely on your partner
 
01:36:11.750 --> 01:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
to make sure that you don't get injured
 
01:36:16.910 --> 01:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
okay so if if someone's having an issue
 
01:36:20.090 --> 01:36:20.100 align:start position:0%
and there's an oops and you have two
 
01:36:23.330 --> 01:36:23.340 align:start position:0%
thousand pounds of lumber following you
 
01:36:25.850 --> 01:36:25.860 align:start position:0%
then that is the noops that you can't
 
01:36:28.729 --> 01:36:28.739 align:start position:0%
take back I doesn't matter if you tested
 
01:36:31.370 --> 01:36:31.380 align:start position:0%
which way it doesn't come back
 
01:36:34.370 --> 01:36:34.380 align:start position:0%
someone doesn't go home
 
01:36:37.490 --> 01:36:37.500 align:start position:0%
if you're operating in a lot it's not
 
01:36:40.669 --> 01:36:40.679 align:start position:0%
just happened to be forklifts forklifts
 
01:36:43.729 --> 01:36:43.739 align:start position:0%
is the hierarchy of it but you have it a
 
01:36:47.390 --> 01:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
lot of other mechanical assistant tools
 
01:36:49.189 --> 01:36:49.199 align:start position:0%
that are used in these retail
 
01:36:51.709 --> 01:36:51.719 align:start position:0%
environments that
 
01:36:54.350 --> 01:36:54.360 align:start position:0%
you're working with customers close in
 
01:36:56.629 --> 01:36:56.639 align:start position:0%
with it you're working with other people
 
01:36:59.810 --> 01:36:59.820 align:start position:0%
close in you're working in narrow our
 
01:37:02.090 --> 01:37:02.100 align:start position:0%
ways and stuff with this power equipment
 
01:37:04.570 --> 01:37:04.580 align:start position:0%
which could have devastating
 
01:37:07.850 --> 01:37:07.860 align:start position:0%
results if an oops
 
01:37:07.860 --> 01:37:09.229 align:start position:0%
results if an oops
happens

01:37:09.229 --> 01:37:09.239 align:start position:0%
happens
 
01:37:09.239 --> 01:37:11.570 align:start position:0%
happens
so

01:37:11.570 --> 01:37:11.580 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:37:14.930 --> 01:37:14.940 align:start position:0%
I dare say if if someone's not on their
 
01:37:14.940 --> 01:37:16.850 align:start position:0%
I dare say if if someone's not on their
game

01:37:16.850 --> 01:37:16.860 align:start position:0%
game
 
01:37:20.510 --> 01:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
a hundred percent oops is not an if it's
 
01:37:22.189 --> 01:37:22.199 align:start position:0%
a win
 
01:37:25.370 --> 01:37:25.380 align:start position:0%
just when is it going to happen now I
 
01:37:27.669 --> 01:37:27.679 align:start position:0%
don't know if anybody's ever saw a video
 
01:37:30.169 --> 01:37:30.179 align:start position:0%
of Representative we're gonna we're
 
01:37:32.870 --> 01:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
speaking on the amendment please yes
 
01:37:38.090 --> 01:37:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:40.070 --> 01:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
the effects of someone not being on
 
01:37:43.070 --> 01:37:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:46.490 --> 01:37:46.500 align:start position:0%
could have some devastating effects
 
01:37:48.590 --> 01:37:48.600 align:start position:0%
with that that's all I have to say thank
 
01:37:48.600 --> 01:38:00.189 align:start position:0%
with that that's all I have to say thank

01:38:00.189 --> 01:38:00.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:02.629 --> 01:38:02.639 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair regarding
 
01:38:05.450 --> 01:38:05.460 align:start position:0%
representative edgington's um comments
 
01:38:07.250 --> 01:38:07.260 align:start position:0%
about uh you know not smoking a joint at
 
01:38:07.260 --> 01:38:08.149 align:start position:0%
about uh you know not smoking a joint at
lunchtime

01:38:08.149 --> 01:38:08.159 align:start position:0%
lunchtime
 
01:38:10.250 --> 01:38:10.260 align:start position:0%
unfortunately and I really mean this
 
01:38:11.570 --> 01:38:11.580 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we don't have the
 
01:38:14.149 --> 01:38:14.159 align:start position:0%
capability of telling whether you know
 
01:38:16.729 --> 01:38:16.739 align:start position:0%
you you smoke The Joint last night
 
01:38:19.430 --> 01:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
oh you smoked it at lunchtime a five
 
01:38:21.470 --> 01:38:21.480 align:start position:0%
dollar bottle of Visine
 
01:38:23.870 --> 01:38:23.880 align:start position:0%
can can get you past the bus
 
01:38:26.450 --> 01:38:26.460 align:start position:0%
okay your eyes aren't red anymore uh
 
01:38:29.330 --> 01:38:29.340 align:start position:0%
you're certainly off your game
 
01:38:31.010 --> 01:38:31.020 align:start position:0%
but your eyes aren't red
 
01:38:32.570 --> 01:38:32.580 align:start position:0%
you probably even pass a roadside
 
01:38:35.030 --> 01:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
sobriety test you know law enforcement
 
01:38:37.610 --> 01:38:37.620 align:start position:0%
and all these cannabis bills
 
01:38:40.250 --> 01:38:40.260 align:start position:0%
um of all you know expressed concern
 
01:38:43.189 --> 01:38:43.199 align:start position:0%
about the inability
 
01:38:45.890 --> 01:38:45.900 align:start position:0%
to test and and be and be able to stand
 
01:38:48.770 --> 01:38:48.780 align:start position:0%
in front of a judge and and uh and get a
 
01:38:50.689 --> 01:38:50.699 align:start position:0%
conviction with well I thought I I
 
01:38:52.970 --> 01:38:52.980 align:start position:0%
looked kind of stone to me
 
01:38:55.129 --> 01:38:55.139 align:start position:0%
you know we don't have the capability of
 
01:38:58.790 --> 01:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
telling and uh you know I I just see you
 
01:39:00.350 --> 01:39:00.360 align:start position:0%
know all kinds of industrial accidents
 
01:39:02.830 --> 01:39:02.840 align:start position:0%
I've worked in you know in trades that
 
01:39:05.149 --> 01:39:05.159 align:start position:0%
like uh you know the representative was
 
01:39:07.970 --> 01:39:07.980 align:start position:0%
talking about that uh that this if
 
01:39:09.770 --> 01:39:09.780 align:start position:0%
somebody isn't on their game part of the
 
01:39:11.990 --> 01:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
team isn't on the game somebody could
 
01:39:14.149 --> 01:39:14.159 align:start position:0%
very well get very hurt now I've got a
 
01:39:16.189 --> 01:39:16.199 align:start position:0%
friend that lost his arm because
 
01:39:18.890 --> 01:39:18.900 align:start position:0%
somebody wasn't on their game okay I
 
01:39:20.629 --> 01:39:20.639 align:start position:0%
know of another guy that that rolled
 
01:39:22.310 --> 01:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
over a forklift and pinned his leg to
 
01:39:24.410 --> 01:39:24.420 align:start position:0%
the to the you know to the cement
 
01:39:26.510 --> 01:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
underneath them and he wasn't on his
 
01:39:30.410 --> 01:39:30.420 align:start position:0%
game okay uh you know in fact he he was
 
01:39:32.810 --> 01:39:32.820 align:start position:0%
stoned he admitted he was Stone
 
01:39:35.149 --> 01:39:35.159 align:start position:0%
um you know we don't have the capability
 
01:39:36.410 --> 01:39:36.420 align:start position:0%
of testing
 
01:39:38.870 --> 01:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
and I I wish that you know that I wish
 
01:39:40.850 --> 01:39:40.860 align:start position:0%
I'd find a solution to that this
 
01:39:40.860 --> 01:39:41.870 align:start position:0%
I'd find a solution to that this
afternoon

01:39:41.870 --> 01:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
01:39:45.350 --> 01:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
but um you know as of right now
 
01:39:46.850 --> 01:39:46.860 align:start position:0%
we're gonna have dangerous people doing
 
01:39:48.770 --> 01:39:48.780 align:start position:0%
dangerous jobs and we won't be able to
 
01:39:49.850 --> 01:39:49.860 align:start position:0%
stop them
 
01:39:51.590 --> 01:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
thanks all right we are talking about
 
01:39:52.970 --> 01:39:52.980 align:start position:0%
the Amendments on the floor
 
01:39:55.070 --> 01:39:55.080 align:start position:0%
representative attitude thank you Mr
 
01:39:57.110 --> 01:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
chairman the good news is that
 
01:40:00.229 --> 01:40:00.239 align:start position:0%
um the amendment pertains to RSA 126x
 
01:40:02.090 --> 01:40:02.100 align:start position:0%
colon four
 
01:40:05.570 --> 01:40:05.580 align:start position:0%
um which highlights the very responsible
 
01:40:07.790 --> 01:40:07.800 align:start position:0%
uh group of people that are presently on
 
01:40:10.010 --> 01:40:10.020 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cannabis program to talk
 
01:40:12.709 --> 01:40:12.719 align:start position:0%
about how this amendment intersects
 
01:40:15.530 --> 01:40:15.540 align:start position:0%
um with that and with the concerns
 
01:40:18.890 --> 01:40:18.900 align:start position:0%
um about safety I think it's important
 
01:40:21.830 --> 01:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
to highlight that there are many rules
 
01:40:24.229 --> 01:40:24.239 align:start position:0%
and regulations that govern the
 
01:40:26.149 --> 01:40:26.159 align:start position:0%
participation of the broader therapeutic
 
01:40:28.790 --> 01:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
cannabis program uh in those people as
 
01:40:30.830 --> 01:40:30.840 align:start position:0%
we heard in testimony
 
01:40:33.709 --> 01:40:33.719 align:start position:0%
um are very aware that their
 
01:40:36.290 --> 01:40:36.300 align:start position:0%
participation is a privilege and not a
 
01:40:40.810 --> 01:40:40.820 align:start position:0%
right New Hampshire is very unique in
 
01:40:43.850 --> 01:40:43.860 align:start position:0%
the rules that we place on those
 
01:40:45.470 --> 01:40:45.480 align:start position:0%
individuals in order to continue to be
 
01:40:47.750 --> 01:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
on the program uh and the testimony
 
01:40:49.070 --> 01:40:49.080 align:start position:0%
alluded to the fact that they are all
 
01:40:51.290 --> 01:40:51.300 align:start position:0%
aware of that and they are aware that at
 
01:40:53.810 --> 01:40:53.820 align:start position:0%
any point if they mess up uh their
 
01:40:55.930 --> 01:40:55.940 align:start position:0%
Privileges and their card can be revoked
 
01:40:59.390 --> 01:40:59.400 align:start position:0%
I believe that puts a
 
01:41:02.570 --> 01:41:02.580 align:start position:0%
comfortable enough chilling effect
 
01:41:04.669 --> 01:41:04.679 align:start position:0%
um on any kind of shenanigans that could
 
01:41:06.649 --> 01:41:06.659 align:start position:0%
lead to impairment as referenced in the
 
01:41:06.659 --> 01:41:08.149 align:start position:0%
lead to impairment as referenced in the
amendment

01:41:08.149 --> 01:41:08.159 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:41:11.629 --> 01:41:11.639 align:start position:0%
um so I am very grateful that while I
 
01:41:13.129 --> 01:41:13.139 align:start position:0%
recognize the situation that the
 
01:41:15.530 --> 01:41:15.540 align:start position:0%
previous speaker was mentioning we have
 
01:41:17.149 --> 01:41:17.159 align:start position:0%
a lot of very responsible people on that
 
01:41:18.950 --> 01:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
program and I want them to be able to
 
01:41:21.709 --> 01:41:21.719 align:start position:0%
work I want them to be able to support
 
01:41:24.290 --> 01:41:24.300 align:start position:0%
themselves and not have to be on the
 
01:41:26.149 --> 01:41:26.159 align:start position:0%
well-functioning employment system that
 
01:41:28.550 --> 01:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
we spoke about on another bill and this
 
01:41:30.530 --> 01:41:30.540 align:start position:0%
is the path to do that
 
01:41:32.870 --> 01:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
representative Leclerc thank you Mr
 
01:41:35.270 --> 01:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
chair although I do agree with a lot of
 
01:41:37.010 --> 01:41:37.020 align:start position:0%
the arguments about you know being
 
01:41:40.609 --> 01:41:40.619 align:start position:0%
impaired and causing a potential safety
 
01:41:42.169 --> 01:41:42.179 align:start position:0%
issue you know I'm in construction too
 
01:41:43.609 --> 01:41:43.619 align:start position:0%
I've been in my whole life you know I
 
01:41:45.649 --> 01:41:45.659 align:start position:0%
don't want someone impaired to set up a
 
01:41:47.390 --> 01:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
staging like we had spoken about and
 
01:41:49.370 --> 01:41:49.380 align:start position:0%
climb up in the air but
 
01:41:51.169 --> 01:41:51.179 align:start position:0%
this right here and I've been on Plenty
 
01:41:52.970 --> 01:41:52.980 align:start position:0%
of job sites where everybody gets drug
 
01:41:52.980 --> 01:41:54.229 align:start position:0%
of job sites where everybody gets drug
tested

01:41:54.229 --> 01:41:54.239 align:start position:0%
tested
 
01:41:57.350 --> 01:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
as long as they could provide a card and
 
01:42:00.649 --> 01:42:00.659 align:start position:0%
prove whether it's an opioid or cannabis
 
01:42:02.750 --> 01:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
or what if they have a doctor's
 
01:42:05.450 --> 01:42:05.460 align:start position:0%
prescription or a card
 
01:42:07.490 --> 01:42:07.500 align:start position:0%
they're allowed to be there they're not
 
01:42:07.500 --> 01:42:08.689 align:start position:0%
they're allowed to be there they're not
impaired

01:42:08.689 --> 01:42:08.699 align:start position:0%
impaired
 
01:42:10.970 --> 01:42:10.980 align:start position:0%
they're just taking what they need to
 
01:42:13.189 --> 01:42:13.199 align:start position:0%
take to function during the day I think
 
01:42:14.990 --> 01:42:15.000 align:start position:0%
the impaired part is
 
01:42:18.050 --> 01:42:18.060 align:start position:0%
the key word in all this right if you
 
01:42:20.750 --> 01:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
are impaired hell no get off my job you
 
01:42:22.609 --> 01:42:22.619 align:start position:0%
don't need to be here
 
01:42:24.830 --> 01:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
um putting other people at risk so I
 
01:42:26.450 --> 01:42:26.460 align:start position:0%
think that right there is the big word
 
01:42:28.490 --> 01:42:28.500 align:start position:0%
the impaired Park you know you have the
 
01:42:32.770 --> 01:42:32.780 align:start position:0%
card you're legal you're within your uh
 
01:42:36.649 --> 01:42:36.659 align:start position:0%
prescription and um that part really
 
01:42:40.970 --> 01:42:40.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:40.980 --> 01:42:42.050 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:42:42.050 --> 01:42:42.060 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:42:43.850 --> 01:42:43.860 align:start position:0%
a lot of people I'll get to everyone as
 
01:42:45.709 --> 01:42:45.719 align:start position:0%
best I can especially the ones that
 
01:42:47.570 --> 01:42:47.580 align:start position:0%
haven't spoken first so let me see the
 
01:42:49.790 --> 01:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
hands over here again
 
01:42:49.800 --> 01:42:51.189 align:start position:0%
hands over here again
okay

01:42:51.189 --> 01:42:51.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:42:53.689 --> 01:42:53.699 align:start position:0%
represent Sullivan and ma'am I'm
 
01:42:56.209 --> 01:42:56.219 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
01:42:58.189 --> 01:42:58.199 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Mary so
 
01:43:02.689 --> 01:43:02.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:05.990 --> 01:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
thank you um I think it's really
 
01:43:09.649 --> 01:43:09.659 align:start position:0%
important to look at 126x3
 
01:43:11.750 --> 01:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
um to see what additional rights an
 
01:43:13.609 --> 01:43:13.619 align:start position:0%
employer has
 
01:43:15.169 --> 01:43:15.179 align:start position:0%
um nothing in this chapter shall be
 
01:43:17.330 --> 01:43:17.340 align:start position:0%
exempt shall exempt any person from
 
01:43:20.149 --> 01:43:20.159 align:start position:0%
arrest or prosecution for being under
 
01:43:22.370 --> 01:43:22.380 align:start position:0%
the influence of cannabis
 
01:43:25.390 --> 01:43:25.400 align:start position:0%
while in his or her place of employment
 
01:43:28.129 --> 01:43:28.139 align:start position:0%
without written permission of the
 
01:43:30.290 --> 01:43:30.300 align:start position:0%
employer if the employer has any
 
01:43:32.390 --> 01:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
concerns about someone being under the
 
01:43:35.030 --> 01:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
influence of cannabis they simply don't
 
01:43:37.070 --> 01:43:37.080 align:start position:0%
give them the written permission
 
01:43:39.830 --> 01:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
if they are under the influence without
 
01:43:42.290 --> 01:43:42.300 align:start position:0%
the permission
 
01:43:46.370 --> 01:43:46.380 align:start position:0%
they can be arrested so that's kind of a
 
01:43:49.189 --> 01:43:49.199 align:start position:0%
big deal in addition I'm sorry represent
 
01:43:53.810 --> 01:43:53.820 align:start position:0%
where are you reading on 126x yes 126x
 
01:43:56.870 --> 01:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
and I'm looking at a section this is and
 
01:43:58.669 --> 01:43:58.679 align:start position:0%
this is very difficult to read I will
 
01:44:01.390 --> 01:44:01.400 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that I didn't write it
 
01:44:05.649 --> 01:44:05.659 align:start position:0%
but basically I'm Roman 2
 
01:44:07.910 --> 01:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
subsection a
 
01:44:11.030 --> 01:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
number two
 
01:44:17.030 --> 01:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
so Roman 2 a 2. so basically and in
 
01:44:19.189 --> 01:44:19.199 align:start position:0%
basically there's there's three
 
01:44:20.629 --> 01:44:20.639 align:start position:0%
different uh
 
01:44:20.639 --> 01:44:21.550 align:start position:0%
different uh
um

01:44:21.550 --> 01:44:21.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:23.629 --> 01:44:23.639 align:start position:0%
circumstances there but I wanted to
 
01:44:25.669 --> 01:44:25.679 align:start position:0%
point out the fact that you can't be
 
01:44:27.530 --> 01:44:27.540 align:start position:0%
under the influence
 
01:44:29.149 --> 01:44:29.159 align:start position:0%
without permission from the employer
 
01:44:31.310 --> 01:44:31.320 align:start position:0%
written permission from the employer in
 
01:44:31.320 --> 01:44:33.649 align:start position:0%
written permission from the employer in
addition

01:44:33.649 --> 01:44:33.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:33.659 --> 01:44:39.669 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:44:39.669 --> 01:44:39.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:42.410 --> 01:44:42.420 align:start position:0%
this is hard okay here
 
01:44:46.310 --> 01:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
um then section B under um two
 
01:44:48.709 --> 01:44:48.719 align:start position:0%
B says the user possession of cannabis
 
01:44:50.450 --> 01:44:50.460 align:start position:0%
by a qualifying patient or designated
 
01:44:52.550 --> 01:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
care caregiver for the purpose other
 
01:44:54.169 --> 01:44:54.179 align:start position:0%
than therapeutic use is permitted by
 
01:44:56.270 --> 01:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
this chapter oh I'm sorry and then the
 
01:44:57.830 --> 01:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
section c is the one I was looking for
 
01:45:01.250 --> 01:45:01.260 align:start position:0%
the smoking or vaporation vaporization
 
01:45:03.530 --> 01:45:03.540 align:start position:0%
of cannabis in any public place
 
01:45:07.490 --> 01:45:07.500 align:start position:0%
including and again we follow down
 
01:45:10.729 --> 01:45:10.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:12.970 --> 01:45:12.980 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:45:16.970 --> 01:45:16.980 align:start position:0%
number two D2 a place of employment
 
01:45:18.709 --> 01:45:18.719 align:start position:0%
without the written permission of the
 
01:45:20.810 --> 01:45:20.820 align:start position:0%
employer so basically
 
01:45:23.450 --> 01:45:23.460 align:start position:0%
if if you are holding the card
 
01:45:26.629 --> 01:45:26.639 align:start position:0%
and you have cannabis in your possession
 
01:45:28.430 --> 01:45:28.440 align:start position:0%
and you want to smoke a joint during
 
01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:29.930 align:start position:0%
and you want to smoke a joint during
lunch

01:45:29.930 --> 01:45:29.940 align:start position:0%
lunch
 
01:45:31.729 --> 01:45:31.739 align:start position:0%
you can be arrested for that and you
 
01:45:34.070 --> 01:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
will lose your card so
 
01:45:38.930 --> 01:45:38.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:38.940 --> 01:45:40.129 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:45:40.129 --> 01:45:40.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:43.850 --> 01:45:43.860 align:start position:0%
important restrictions that 126x
 
01:45:46.990 --> 01:45:47.000 align:start position:0%
provides for so um
 
01:45:49.729 --> 01:45:49.739 align:start position:0%
that's why I passed it out you really
 
01:45:51.290 --> 01:45:51.300 align:start position:0%
you shouldn't be reading the bill
 
01:45:54.470 --> 01:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
without reading 126x as well because the
 
01:45:56.750 --> 01:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
two are very much interconnected and I
 
01:45:59.709 --> 01:45:59.719 align:start position:0%
would point out um Mr chairman that uh
 
01:46:03.830 --> 01:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
the amendment is identical or the
 
01:46:05.510 --> 01:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
amendment replaces the entire original
 
01:46:08.750 --> 01:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
bill with the exception of the um uh
 
01:46:11.510 --> 01:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
effective date so it's it the amendment
 
01:46:14.570 --> 01:46:14.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:17.270 --> 01:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative McKenzie thank
 
01:46:20.030 --> 01:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman there were two
 
01:46:22.129 --> 01:46:22.139 align:start position:0%
references currently in New Hampshire
 
01:46:22.139 --> 01:46:23.149 align:start position:0%
references currently in New Hampshire
law

01:46:23.149 --> 01:46:23.159 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:46:26.629 --> 01:46:26.639 align:start position:0%
that refer to the issue of controlled
 
01:46:29.450 --> 01:46:29.460 align:start position:0%
substances and and one of them is a
 
01:46:32.030 --> 01:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
reference under the workers compensation
 
01:46:35.510 --> 01:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
statute which refers to those people who
 
01:46:39.410 --> 01:46:39.420 align:start position:0%
have a prescription for controlled drugs
 
01:46:42.169 --> 01:46:42.179 align:start position:0%
and they're not considered to be uh
 
01:46:44.750 --> 01:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
intoxicated intoxication means
 
01:46:47.149 --> 01:46:47.159 align:start position:0%
intoxication by alcohol all controlled
 
01:46:50.629 --> 01:46:50.639 align:start position:0%
substance as defined in our say 318b1
 
01:46:53.390 --> 01:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
the definition shall not include any
 
01:46:56.149 --> 01:46:56.159 align:start position:0%
employees use of a controlled drug for
 
01:46:57.910 --> 01:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
which the prescription has been issued
 
01:47:00.350 --> 01:47:00.360 align:start position:0%
authorizing such drug to be dispensed to
 
01:47:00.360 --> 01:47:01.129 align:start position:0%
authorizing such drug to be dispensed to
him

01:47:01.129 --> 01:47:01.139 align:start position:0%
him
 
01:47:03.590 --> 01:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
and secondly there is a reference under
 
01:47:07.070 --> 01:47:07.080 align:start position:0%
318 B1 definitions which also refers to
 
01:47:09.530 --> 01:47:09.540 align:start position:0%
the issue prescribed
 
01:47:11.870 --> 01:47:11.880 align:start position:0%
um and you can I can provide that to the
 
01:47:14.510 --> 01:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
committee the the issue is that if it is
 
01:47:16.370 --> 01:47:16.380 align:start position:0%
a prescribed substance
 
01:47:19.070 --> 01:47:19.080 align:start position:0%
uh and it's prescribed by a physician or
 
01:47:21.830 --> 01:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
however we get to this the issue of uh
 
01:47:24.470 --> 01:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
of how people get cannabis that there is
 
01:47:26.510 --> 01:47:26.520 align:start position:0%
there are Provisions in the law that
 
01:47:29.330 --> 01:47:29.340 align:start position:0%
address this that talk about this uh and
 
01:47:31.270 --> 01:47:31.280 align:start position:0%
they've been in the law for some time
 
01:47:34.910 --> 01:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
uh you can't go into a and I agree and I
 
01:47:37.609 --> 01:47:37.619 align:start position:0%
I've had you know I've run companies I
 
01:47:39.649 --> 01:47:39.659 align:start position:0%
run uh I was a firefighter for a long
 
01:47:41.689 --> 01:47:41.699 align:start position:0%
time I had people under my under my
 
01:47:43.729 --> 01:47:43.739 align:start position:0%
charge uh you know the difference
 
01:47:45.709 --> 01:47:45.719 align:start position:0%
between somebody is intoxicated and
 
01:47:48.709 --> 01:47:48.719 align:start position:0%
somebody uh who's not and you you
 
01:47:52.609 --> 01:47:52.619 align:start position:0%
address that but the fact is that we are
 
01:47:54.169 --> 01:47:54.179 align:start position:0%
putting cannabis in a very different
 
01:47:56.030 --> 01:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
place than the other controlled
 
01:47:58.910 --> 01:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
substances and the law addresses that
 
01:48:00.590 --> 01:48:00.600 align:start position:0%
and they said if you have a prescription
 
01:48:03.169 --> 01:48:03.179 align:start position:0%
form so the question I have I guess is
 
01:48:06.350 --> 01:48:06.360 align:start position:0%
how is it that somebody that comes in uh
 
01:48:09.290 --> 01:48:09.300 align:start position:0%
and the Cannabis is the issue and yet
 
01:48:11.390 --> 01:48:11.400 align:start position:0%
you have all these other substances that
 
01:48:14.629 --> 01:48:14.639 align:start position:0%
say you that that they are uh allowable
 
01:48:17.570 --> 01:48:17.580 align:start position:0%
if you have a prescription so there's an
 
01:48:19.729 --> 01:48:19.739 align:start position:0%
issue that I have about how we are we
 
01:48:21.890 --> 01:48:21.900 align:start position:0%
discriminating against people who have
 
01:48:24.470 --> 01:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
the right to have prescriptions that uh
 
01:48:26.570 --> 01:48:26.580 align:start position:0%
whether it be controlled substances and
 
01:48:28.790 --> 01:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
these are both in the law do we
 
01:48:30.770 --> 01:48:30.780 align:start position:0%
discriminate against people specifically
 
01:48:32.689 --> 01:48:32.699 align:start position:0%
because it's cannabis
 
01:48:35.689 --> 01:48:35.699 align:start position:0%
because the law allows for people to be
 
01:48:39.109 --> 01:48:39.119 align:start position:0%
on prescription drugs and to work and to
 
01:48:41.870 --> 01:48:41.880 align:start position:0%
go to work and it happens every day I
 
01:48:43.669 --> 01:48:43.679 align:start position:0%
could go to a dentist tomorrow they give
 
01:48:46.609 --> 01:48:46.619 align:start position:0%
me uh oxy to get me over this this
 
01:48:49.910 --> 01:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
routine and yet I go to work and the
 
01:48:51.890 --> 01:48:51.900 align:start position:0%
doctor prescribes it and the doctor says
 
01:48:53.990 --> 01:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
you have uh don't take more than this
 
01:48:55.370 --> 01:48:55.380 align:start position:0%
and if you do you got to be in trouble
 
01:48:57.770 --> 01:48:57.780 align:start position:0%
so it's a prescribed job just like
 
01:48:59.270 --> 01:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
cannabis would be
 
01:49:04.250 --> 01:49:04.260 align:start position:0%
it is a it is a uh a list of those kinds
 
01:49:06.470 --> 01:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
of things that you would have access to
 
01:49:09.050 --> 01:49:09.060 align:start position:0%
for a whole variety of things and there
 
01:49:10.310 --> 01:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
are all kinds of people that we heard
 
01:49:12.649 --> 01:49:12.659 align:start position:0%
from that that are out in the in the
 
01:49:14.510 --> 01:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
business world today so if we're going
 
01:49:17.330 --> 01:49:17.340 align:start position:0%
to start saying to employers well if
 
01:49:18.890 --> 01:49:18.900 align:start position:0%
somebody comes in and they got cannabis
 
01:49:22.430 --> 01:49:22.440 align:start position:0%
just because they put down cannabis
 
01:49:24.590 --> 01:49:24.600 align:start position:0%
we're going to knock them out and then
 
01:49:25.850 --> 01:49:25.860 align:start position:0%
if they put down other control
 
01:49:28.729 --> 01:49:28.739 align:start position:0%
substances which are listed in under 318
 
01:49:30.530 --> 01:49:30.540 align:start position:0%
we're going to knock them off for that
 
01:49:31.609 --> 01:49:31.619 align:start position:0%
and we're going to knock them off with
 
01:49:32.629 --> 01:49:32.639 align:start position:0%
this and we're going to knock them off
 
01:49:34.430 --> 01:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
with that so where does it stop the law
 
01:49:36.890 --> 01:49:36.900 align:start position:0%
says if it's prescribed it's allowable
 
01:49:39.290 --> 01:49:39.300 align:start position:0%
and that's the point here and the law is
 
01:49:40.850 --> 01:49:40.860 align:start position:0%
clear but that whether it be workers
 
01:49:42.950 --> 01:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
compensation or the control Drug Act
 
01:49:44.510 --> 01:49:44.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:49:46.609 --> 01:49:46.619 align:start position:0%
welcome representative Murray
 
01:49:49.250 --> 01:49:49.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just wanted to take
 
01:49:51.290 --> 01:49:51.300 align:start position:0%
a moment to remind the committee
 
01:49:53.330 --> 01:49:53.340 align:start position:0%
um of how hard it is to get a medical
 
01:49:56.209 --> 01:49:56.219 align:start position:0%
card in New Hampshire excuse me because
 
01:49:57.290 --> 01:49:57.300 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of talk about
 
01:49:59.450 --> 01:49:59.460 align:start position:0%
operation of heavy machinery
 
01:50:01.129 --> 01:50:01.139 align:start position:0%
which I don't think anyone with a
 
01:50:03.350 --> 01:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
medical card would be doing so if you
 
01:50:05.570 --> 01:50:05.580 align:start position:0%
want to get a medical card the
 
01:50:08.470 --> 01:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
conditions that are allowable are autism
 
01:50:11.390 --> 01:50:11.400 align:start position:0%
moderate or severe PTSD moderate or
 
01:50:13.550 --> 01:50:13.560 align:start position:0%
severe chronic pain severe pain that has
 
01:50:15.410 --> 01:50:15.420 align:start position:0%
not responded to previously prescribed
 
01:50:17.450 --> 01:50:17.460 align:start position:0%
medication or surgical measures and
 
01:50:20.149 --> 01:50:20.159 align:start position:0%
opioid use disorder as far as I know
 
01:50:21.830 --> 01:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
anyone with chronic pain is not going to
 
01:50:24.649 --> 01:50:24.659 align:start position:0%
be working a heavy manual labor job that
 
01:50:26.930 --> 01:50:26.940 align:start position:0%
is going to put other people at risk and
 
01:50:28.790 --> 01:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
any other diagnoses also require
 
01:50:31.370 --> 01:50:31.380 align:start position:0%
symptoms such as Alzheimer's
 
01:50:33.350 --> 01:50:33.360 align:start position:0%
chemotherapy induced anorexia constant
 
01:50:34.970 --> 01:50:34.980 align:start position:0%
or severe nausea these are all like
 
01:50:36.189 --> 01:50:36.199 align:start position:0%
super physical
 
01:50:39.470 --> 01:50:39.480 align:start position:0%
symptoms these people are not going to
 
01:50:40.910 --> 01:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
be working jobs that are going to put
 
01:50:42.649 --> 01:50:42.659 align:start position:0%
other people in danger danger while
 
01:50:44.930 --> 01:50:44.940 align:start position:0%
they're on the job it's older folks who
 
01:50:46.310 --> 01:50:46.320 align:start position:0%
maybe do not have enough on Social
 
01:50:47.930 --> 01:50:47.940 align:start position:0%
Security to just live off of that and
 
01:50:50.390 --> 01:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
they're taking you know cannabis to
 
01:50:52.850 --> 01:50:52.860 align:start position:0%
treat their pain it's people like that
 
01:50:54.890 --> 01:50:54.900 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to give them away to
 
01:50:57.050 --> 01:50:57.060 align:start position:0%
still access employment while taking
 
01:50:59.450 --> 01:50:59.460 align:start position:0%
their legally prescribed medication
 
01:51:01.910 --> 01:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
and again the number of people that have
 
01:51:03.290 --> 01:51:03.300 align:start position:0%
medical cards again because they're so
 
01:51:05.149 --> 01:51:05.159 align:start position:0%
hard to get is very very low
 
01:51:06.350 --> 01:51:06.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:51:09.709 --> 01:51:09.719 align:start position:0%
welcome but the second I got other
 
01:51:11.570 --> 01:51:11.580 align:start position:0%
people who are who are representative
 
01:51:14.270 --> 01:51:14.280 align:start position:0%
colcum representative abalone
 
01:51:17.270 --> 01:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
foreign thank you Mr chair
 
01:51:19.010 --> 01:51:19.020 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to divert from my original
 
01:51:21.590 --> 01:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
comment a little bit uh in response to
 
01:51:24.350 --> 01:51:24.360 align:start position:0%
the the comments just made from the
 
01:51:25.970 --> 01:51:25.980 align:start position:0%
previous representative I believe that
 
01:51:27.890 --> 01:51:27.900 align:start position:0%
we did hear
 
01:51:30.709 --> 01:51:30.719 align:start position:0%
um during our testimony that by one of
 
01:51:32.450 --> 01:51:32.460 align:start position:0%
our own members that it was fairly easy
 
01:51:35.330 --> 01:51:35.340 align:start position:0%
for him to get a card and in response to
 
01:51:38.450 --> 01:51:38.460 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie I think also we
 
01:51:40.790 --> 01:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
heard during our testimony that there is
 
01:51:42.470 --> 01:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
no prescription for cannabis and there
 
01:51:46.310 --> 01:51:46.320 align:start position:0%
is no doctor that is following the use
 
01:51:48.709 --> 01:51:48.719 align:start position:0%
of or prescribing or following the use
 
01:51:52.250 --> 01:51:52.260 align:start position:0%
of medical I'm sorry therapeutic
 
01:51:55.250 --> 01:51:55.260 align:start position:0%
cannabis with any patient today that
 
01:51:57.350 --> 01:51:57.360 align:start position:0%
that's not part of our law so to compare
 
01:51:58.970 --> 01:51:58.980 align:start position:0%
this again to the prescriptions that are
 
01:52:01.609 --> 01:52:01.619 align:start position:0%
being issued and being overseen by
 
01:52:03.669 --> 01:52:03.679 align:start position:0%
doctors I think is
 
01:52:06.590 --> 01:52:06.600 align:start position:0%
not pertaining to this but I want to go
 
01:52:08.709 --> 01:52:08.719 align:start position:0%
back to my original comment
 
01:52:12.410 --> 01:52:12.420 align:start position:0%
regarding this amendment and that the
 
01:52:15.350 --> 01:52:15.360 align:start position:0%
the deny employment to is an important
 
01:52:18.169 --> 01:52:18.179 align:start position:0%
piece for me because as an employer you
 
01:52:19.970 --> 01:52:19.980 align:start position:0%
don't know the work ethics of people you
 
01:52:23.870 --> 01:52:23.880 align:start position:0%
don't know the habits of people and for
 
01:52:26.750 --> 01:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
me as an employer to think that somebody
 
01:52:26.760 --> 01:52:28.669 align:start position:0%
me as an employer to think that somebody
is

01:52:28.669 --> 01:52:28.679 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:52:32.930 --> 01:52:32.940 align:start position:0%
in need of therapeutic cannabis
 
01:52:34.970 --> 01:52:34.980 align:start position:0%
because they are
 
01:52:38.090 --> 01:52:38.100 align:start position:0%
dealing with anxiety or discomfort or
 
01:52:39.830 --> 01:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
pain and opioids are not handling this
 
01:52:41.570 --> 01:52:41.580 align:start position:0%
and they've transitioned over it would
 
01:52:43.250 --> 01:52:43.260 align:start position:0%
be very naive of me to think that they
 
01:52:44.930 --> 01:52:44.940 align:start position:0%
can get through an eight or ten hour day
 
01:52:47.149 --> 01:52:47.159 align:start position:0%
a 10 hour shift without needing to use
 
01:52:49.970 --> 01:52:49.980 align:start position:0%
cannabis and I realized that that you
 
01:52:51.590 --> 01:52:51.600 align:start position:0%
know that would have to be disclosed but
 
01:52:54.169 --> 01:52:54.179 align:start position:0%
again hiring a new employee that I know
 
01:52:56.149 --> 01:52:56.159 align:start position:0%
nothing about their work ethic and I'm
 
01:52:57.950 --> 01:52:57.960 align:start position:0%
going on good faith based off of an
 
01:53:01.850 --> 01:53:01.860 align:start position:0%
interview process excuse me process I I
 
01:53:04.010 --> 01:53:04.020 align:start position:0%
struggle with that and that's the of
 
01:53:06.350 --> 01:53:06.360 align:start position:0%
this entire Amendment those three words
 
01:53:10.490 --> 01:53:10.500 align:start position:0%
are my reason for voting against this
 
01:53:13.010 --> 01:53:13.020 align:start position:0%
um and nothing that has been said here
 
01:53:15.830 --> 01:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
today is swaying me away from those
 
01:53:17.990 --> 01:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
three words
 
01:53:22.430 --> 01:53:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:24.470 --> 01:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um having sat in
 
01:53:25.729 --> 01:53:25.739 align:start position:0%
on some of those meetings and
 
01:53:27.709 --> 01:53:27.719 align:start position:0%
participated in some of the conversation
 
01:53:30.050 --> 01:53:30.060 align:start position:0%
which I always appreciate
 
01:53:30.060 --> 01:53:30.649 align:start position:0%
which I always appreciate
um

01:53:30.649 --> 01:53:30.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:32.570 --> 01:53:32.580 align:start position:0%
from the subcommittee
 
01:53:32.580 --> 01:53:35.209 align:start position:0%
from the subcommittee
um

01:53:35.209 --> 01:53:35.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:36.950 --> 01:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
we heard medical cannabis is not
 
01:53:36.960 --> 01:53:38.030 align:start position:0%
we heard medical cannabis is not
prescribed

01:53:38.030 --> 01:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
prescribed
 
01:53:39.229 --> 01:53:39.239 align:start position:0%
um so it wouldn't fall under the
 
01:53:39.239 --> 01:53:40.790 align:start position:0%
um so it wouldn't fall under the
prescription

01:53:40.790 --> 01:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
prescription
 
01:53:43.490 --> 01:53:43.500 align:start position:0%
um guidelines or rules that would fall
 
01:53:45.350 --> 01:53:45.360 align:start position:0%
under the protections for prescription
 
01:53:45.360 --> 01:53:46.910 align:start position:0%
under the protections for prescription
drugs

01:53:46.910 --> 01:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
drugs
 
01:53:49.910 --> 01:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
um also there is no in the amendment
 
01:53:52.010 --> 01:53:52.020 align:start position:0%
there is no Provisions for a religious
 
01:53:55.550 --> 01:53:55.560 align:start position:0%
objection any Zero Tolerance policies uh
 
01:53:57.770 --> 01:53:57.780 align:start position:0%
drug-free zones and there's no
 
01:53:59.570 --> 01:53:59.580 align:start position:0%
definition of impairment to allow an
 
01:54:02.270 --> 01:54:02.280 align:start position:0%
employer to make an adequate decision on
 
01:54:04.490 --> 01:54:04.500 align:start position:0%
whether an employee is impaired or not
 
01:54:07.010 --> 01:54:07.020 align:start position:0%
impaired and there was lots of topics of
 
01:54:10.010 --> 01:54:10.020 align:start position:0%
conversation of whether any
 
01:54:12.370 --> 01:54:12.380 align:start position:0%
test can be
 
01:54:14.870 --> 01:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
allowed for that or any benchmarks like
 
01:54:17.629 --> 01:54:17.639 align:start position:0%
we have for intoxication as being 0.08
 
01:54:19.689 --> 01:54:19.699 align:start position:0%
or some type of intoxication for
 
01:54:22.430 --> 01:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
cannabis while in the while being
 
01:54:27.229 --> 01:54:27.239 align:start position:0%
employed and lastly for Section
 
01:54:29.689 --> 01:54:29.699 align:start position:0%
um for the sponsor of the amendment for
 
01:54:32.030 --> 01:54:32.040 align:start position:0%
Section colon
 
01:54:34.970 --> 01:54:34.980 align:start position:0%
for part two section two in his or her
 
01:54:36.109 --> 01:54:36.119 align:start position:0%
place of employing with our written
 
01:54:37.729 --> 01:54:37.739 align:start position:0%
permission of the employer if the
 
01:54:39.470 --> 01:54:39.480 align:start position:0%
written permission is not given by the
 
01:54:42.169 --> 01:54:42.179 align:start position:0%
employer is the employer now denying
 
01:54:44.149 --> 01:54:44.159 align:start position:0%
employment to
 
01:54:44.159 --> 01:54:45.050 align:start position:0%
employment to
um

01:54:45.050 --> 01:54:45.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:46.910 --> 01:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
that employee because they did not give
 
01:54:56.870 --> 01:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:59.209 --> 01:54:59.219 align:start position:0%
they were actually asking a question to
 
01:55:07.490 --> 01:55:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:07.500 --> 01:55:08.990 align:start position:0%
 
because

01:55:08.990 --> 01:55:09.000 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:55:11.870 --> 01:55:11.880 align:start position:0%
we're always respectful here
 
01:55:13.310 --> 01:55:13.320 align:start position:0%
um I'll kind of break the chain here
 
01:55:15.229 --> 01:55:15.239 align:start position:0%
before I go to representative Cahill and
 
01:55:17.030 --> 01:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
allow website if you'd like to answer
 
01:55:19.070 --> 01:55:19.080 align:start position:0%
one of those questions
 
01:55:20.810 --> 01:55:20.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:55:24.770 --> 01:55:24.780 align:start position:0%
um I would like to point out that the
 
01:55:24.780 --> 01:55:25.370 align:start position:0%
um I would like to point out that the
um

01:55:25.370 --> 01:55:25.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:30.410 --> 01:55:30.420 align:start position:0%
line in 126 x colon 3 that talks about
 
01:55:32.810 --> 01:55:32.820 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cannabis program starts
 
01:55:34.430 --> 01:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
off on Roman two nothing in this chapter
 
01:55:36.229 --> 01:55:36.239 align:start position:0%
shall exempt any person from arrest or
 
01:55:39.770 --> 01:55:39.780 align:start position:0%
prosecution from going down to section c
 
01:55:41.990 --> 01:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
the smoking or vaporization of cannabis
 
01:55:44.030 --> 01:55:44.040 align:start position:0%
in any public place including a public
 
01:55:46.010 --> 01:55:46.020 align:start position:0%
bus or other public vehicle or a public
 
01:55:48.350 --> 01:55:48.360 align:start position:0%
park public beach public field
 
01:55:50.030 --> 01:55:50.040 align:start position:0%
the possession of cannabis in any of the
 
01:55:51.350 --> 01:55:51.360 align:start position:0%
following a building grounds of
 
01:55:52.729 --> 01:55:52.739 align:start position:0%
preschool Elementary School Secondary
 
01:55:54.109 --> 01:55:54.119 align:start position:0%
School which are located in the area
 
01:55:57.590 --> 01:55:57.600 align:start position:0%
designated as a drug-free zone or a
 
01:55:58.970 --> 01:55:58.980 align:start position:0%
place of employment without the written
 
01:56:01.010 --> 01:56:01.020 align:start position:0%
permission of the employer there's a lot
 
01:56:02.990 --> 01:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
that's already covered in 126x I don't
 
01:56:05.270 --> 01:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
know if it would be appropriate to have
 
01:56:08.450 --> 01:56:08.460 align:start position:0%
a little uh self-silent reading time
 
01:56:10.910 --> 01:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
um to check that out but I I appreciate
 
01:56:12.410 --> 01:56:12.420 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan printing that
 
01:56:13.669 --> 01:56:13.679 align:start position:0%
out and bringing it because I think
 
01:56:15.050 --> 01:56:15.060 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of questions that are
 
01:56:16.550 --> 01:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
answered in this debate by checking out
 
01:56:19.669 --> 01:56:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:22.310 --> 01:56:22.320 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman may I well considering I
 
01:56:23.750 --> 01:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
don't think the last set two sentences
 
01:56:25.550 --> 01:56:25.560 align:start position:0%
where I gave you a courtesy were
 
01:56:28.370 --> 01:56:28.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:30.290 --> 01:56:30.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh there are a
 
01:56:31.850 --> 01:56:31.860 align:start position:0%
number of drug-free zones besides
 
01:56:31.860 --> 01:56:32.930 align:start position:0%
number of drug-free zones besides
schools

01:56:32.930 --> 01:56:32.940 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:56:32.940 --> 01:56:33.709 align:start position:0%
schools
um

01:56:33.709 --> 01:56:33.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:35.149 --> 01:56:35.159 align:start position:0%
police departments would be one of the
 
01:56:36.770 --> 01:56:36.780 align:start position:0%
fire departments could also be another
 
01:56:40.550 --> 01:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
one drug B loans so um saying that I can
 
01:56:43.010 --> 01:56:43.020 align:start position:0%
unable to read the bill
 
01:56:46.430 --> 01:56:46.440 align:start position:0%
um is kind of offensive no we're done
 
01:56:49.790 --> 01:56:49.800 align:start position:0%
we're done representative Cahill
 
01:56:51.830 --> 01:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:56:51.840 --> 01:56:53.149 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
uh

01:56:53.149 --> 01:56:53.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:56:55.790 --> 01:56:55.800 align:start position:0%
I'd like to point out that when you are
 
01:56:58.550 --> 01:56:58.560 align:start position:0%
hiring someone and you require a a drug
 
01:57:01.189 --> 01:57:01.199 align:start position:0%
test and they pass it this could very
 
01:57:03.470 --> 01:57:03.480 align:start position:0%
well be because they had abstained for a
 
01:57:05.209 --> 01:57:05.219 align:start position:0%
period of time knowing that they were in
 
01:57:07.729 --> 01:57:07.739 align:start position:0%
the job market and a drug test was
 
01:57:11.149 --> 01:57:11.159 align:start position:0%
likely and upon you know getting their
 
01:57:12.709 --> 01:57:12.719 align:start position:0%
first paycheck they could go out and buy
 
01:57:14.270 --> 01:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
some cannabis as I'm told is a very
 
01:57:16.970 --> 01:57:16.980 align:start position:0%
popular here in New Hampshire
 
01:57:18.589 --> 01:57:18.599 align:start position:0%
um so I'm not sure how much protection
 
01:57:19.729 --> 01:57:19.739 align:start position:0%
you're getting unless you're going to
 
01:57:22.430 --> 01:57:22.440 align:start position:0%
test somebody every day which would be
 
01:57:22.440 --> 01:57:24.229 align:start position:0%
test somebody every day which would be
expensive

01:57:24.229 --> 01:57:24.239 align:start position:0%
expensive
 
01:57:26.390 --> 01:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
um the other piece is I mean I'm
 
01:57:28.850 --> 01:57:28.860 align:start position:0%
familiar with I have my wife's cousin
 
01:57:31.490 --> 01:57:31.500 align:start position:0%
was in a terrible car accident uh he had
 
01:57:33.890 --> 01:57:33.900 align:start position:0%
all sorts of surgeries and and pain
 
01:57:36.050 --> 01:57:36.060 align:start position:0%
medicines and was really having a very
 
01:57:39.830 --> 01:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
miserable life until he got a uh the
 
01:57:42.649 --> 01:57:42.659 align:start position:0%
medical therapy card and he takes a
 
01:57:44.390 --> 01:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
couple of drops before he goes to bed
 
01:57:47.510 --> 01:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
and his life is much better he doesn't I
 
01:57:49.070 --> 01:57:49.080 align:start position:0%
don't think I don't even know that he
 
01:57:51.109 --> 01:57:51.119 align:start position:0%
will drive if he's feeling a little bit
 
01:57:53.689 --> 01:57:53.699 align:start position:0%
you know stoned from this which I doubt
 
01:57:55.790 --> 01:57:55.800 align:start position:0%
he would the next day so it's something
 
01:57:57.290 --> 01:57:57.300 align:start position:0%
that people understand the
 
01:57:59.930 --> 01:57:59.940 align:start position:0%
responsibility much like when you have a
 
01:58:01.910 --> 01:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
prescription that says take two of these
 
01:58:04.669 --> 01:58:04.679 align:start position:0%
don't take four you know you kind of on
 
01:58:06.530 --> 01:58:06.540 align:start position:0%
your own to be responsible and I think
 
01:58:08.930 --> 01:58:08.940 align:start position:0%
someone who shows up with it with the
 
01:58:10.850 --> 01:58:10.860 align:start position:0%
card and says I've got this problem that
 
01:58:14.209 --> 01:58:14.219 align:start position:0%
a doctor has approved this card and I
 
01:58:15.830 --> 01:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
can do this work and I'm not gonna it's
 
01:58:18.229 --> 01:58:18.239 align:start position:0%
not gonna interfere with safety or
 
01:58:20.450 --> 01:58:20.460 align:start position:0%
anything like that the person is really
 
01:58:21.589 --> 01:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
demonstrating that they're being
 
01:58:23.629 --> 01:58:23.639 align:start position:0%
responsible by coming in and telling you
 
01:58:25.550 --> 01:58:25.560 align:start position:0%
they have the card they don't even have
 
01:58:28.070 --> 01:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
to do that they could just come in and
 
01:58:30.950 --> 01:58:30.960 align:start position:0%
greet you in the interview and take the
 
01:58:32.390 --> 01:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
test and whatever you want to do
 
01:58:33.890 --> 01:58:33.900 align:start position:0%
demonstrate their ability show you the
 
01:58:35.689 --> 01:58:35.699 align:start position:0%
resume they don't have to mention the
 
01:58:37.250 --> 01:58:37.260 align:start position:0%
card they're being upfront and saying I
 
01:58:39.589 --> 01:58:39.599 align:start position:0%
have a condition that I benefit from
 
01:58:41.870 --> 01:58:41.880 align:start position:0%
because I have this card
 
01:58:44.689 --> 01:58:44.699 align:start position:0%
uh also going back to an earlier time I
 
01:58:44.699 --> 01:58:46.270 align:start position:0%
uh also going back to an earlier time I
remember

01:58:46.270 --> 01:58:46.280 align:start position:0%
remember
 
01:58:49.430 --> 01:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
a colleague who was driving a forklift
 
01:58:51.890 --> 01:58:51.900 align:start position:0%
truck ran over the foot of the head of
 
01:58:53.570 --> 01:58:53.580 align:start position:0%
the Safety Committee
 
01:58:56.149 --> 01:58:56.159 align:start position:0%
and nobody was stoned it's just
 
01:58:58.070 --> 01:58:58.080 align:start position:0%
accidents happen
 
01:59:00.109 --> 01:59:00.119 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:59:01.550 --> 01:59:01.560 align:start position:0%
I'm representative seaworth followed by
 
01:59:03.229 --> 01:59:03.239 align:start position:0%
representative look
 
01:59:07.010 --> 01:59:07.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I wanted to make a
 
01:59:08.810 --> 01:59:08.820 align:start position:0%
point several Representatives have
 
01:59:11.109 --> 01:59:11.119 align:start position:0%
brought up the fact that there aren't
 
01:59:14.330 --> 01:59:14.340 align:start position:0%
prescriptions for medical marijuana
 
01:59:16.850 --> 01:59:16.860 align:start position:0%
and I I think it's important just in
 
01:59:19.669 --> 01:59:19.679 align:start position:0%
case our federal representatives are
 
01:59:23.750 --> 01:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
watching our debate here today I'd like
 
01:59:25.990 --> 01:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
to point out that this is a problem
 
01:59:29.209 --> 01:59:29.219 align:start position:0%
created by the federal government
 
01:59:31.790 --> 01:59:31.800 align:start position:0%
and we're stuck with trying to work it
 
01:59:34.089 --> 01:59:34.099 align:start position:0%
out we heard this during testimony
 
01:59:37.310 --> 01:59:37.320 align:start position:0%
marijuana cannot be prescribed because
 
01:59:39.830 --> 01:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
it's a schedule one drug and there is no
 
01:59:42.589 --> 01:59:42.599 align:start position:0%
nothing you can do with it legally at
 
01:59:43.669 --> 01:59:43.679 align:start position:0%
the same time the federal government
 
01:59:45.890 --> 01:59:45.900 align:start position:0%
kind of looks the other way and
 
01:59:49.550 --> 01:59:49.560 align:start position:0%
you know allows what's going on with
 
01:59:53.089 --> 01:59:53.099 align:start position:0%
medic marijuana to happen leaving our
 
01:59:55.850 --> 01:59:55.860 align:start position:0%
committee in this situation where we
 
01:59:58.010 --> 01:59:58.020 align:start position:0%
can't win either way
 
02:00:01.370 --> 02:00:01.380 align:start position:0%
um so I wanted to make that point yes if
 
02:00:03.350 --> 02:00:03.360 align:start position:0%
it were opiates
 
02:00:05.689 --> 02:00:05.699 align:start position:0%
um the law would be able to deal with
 
02:00:08.810 --> 02:00:08.820 align:start position:0%
the situation because it's marijuana
 
02:00:11.209 --> 02:00:11.219 align:start position:0%
all the protections that are in place
 
02:00:14.570 --> 02:00:14.580 align:start position:0%
both for employer and employee
 
02:00:17.990 --> 02:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
fail because of the way the federal
 
02:00:20.209 --> 02:00:20.219 align:start position:0%
government has classified this substance
 
02:00:23.629 --> 02:00:23.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:23.639 --> 02:00:25.250 align:start position:0%
 
look

02:00:25.250 --> 02:00:25.260 align:start position:0%
look
 
02:00:27.770 --> 02:00:27.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and if I may add to
 
02:00:30.169 --> 02:00:30.179 align:start position:0%
that there was no way to uh to medically
 
02:00:32.629 --> 02:00:32.639 align:start position:0%
supervise uh
 
02:00:35.689 --> 02:00:35.699 align:start position:0%
um this uh
 
02:00:37.669 --> 02:00:37.679 align:start position:0%
this program
 
02:00:39.709 --> 02:00:39.719 align:start position:0%
um also uh you know we we talked about
 
02:00:41.930 --> 02:00:41.940 align:start position:0%
Job classifications in the amendment in
 
02:00:43.790 --> 02:00:43.800 align:start position:0%
the summon title 10
 
02:00:45.250 --> 02:00:45.260 align:start position:0%
um you know there's a half a dozen maybe
 
02:00:48.649 --> 02:00:48.659 align:start position:0%
I I think if we sat here we could go on
 
02:00:49.910 --> 02:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
for days
 
02:00:51.890 --> 02:00:51.900 align:start position:0%
and figure out different job
 
02:00:54.050 --> 02:00:54.060 align:start position:0%
classifications that's what the lawyer
 
02:00:56.450 --> 02:00:56.460 align:start position:0%
from the insurance commissioner his
 
02:00:59.510 --> 02:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
office said it would have to you know in
 
02:00:59.520 --> 02:01:01.010 align:start position:0%
office said it would have to you know in
detail

02:01:01.010 --> 02:01:01.020 align:start position:0%
detail
 
02:01:03.589 --> 02:01:03.599 align:start position:0%
every single classific job
 
02:01:07.550 --> 02:01:07.560 align:start position:0%
classification and uh when would for
 
02:01:09.950 --> 02:01:09.960 align:start position:0%
sure would leave a few out and uh and
 
02:01:11.510 --> 02:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
that once again opens that proverbial
 
02:01:13.189 --> 02:01:13.199 align:start position:0%
can of worms
 
02:01:15.589 --> 02:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
um I've also heard that uh you know if
 
02:01:17.390 --> 02:01:17.400 align:start position:0%
you have a couple joints in your pack of
 
02:01:19.370 --> 02:01:19.380 align:start position:0%
cigarettes you could be arrested and not
 
02:01:20.570 --> 02:01:20.580 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire you can't
 
02:01:22.669 --> 02:01:22.679 align:start position:0%
you know possession onto three quarters
 
02:01:24.229 --> 02:01:24.239 align:start position:0%
of an ounce of violation like spitting
 
02:01:26.570 --> 02:01:26.580 align:start position:0%
on the sidewalk okay you'll get a ticket
 
02:01:28.310 --> 02:01:28.320 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
02:01:30.350 --> 02:01:30.360 align:start position:0%
um in um
 
02:01:33.649 --> 02:01:33.659 align:start position:0%
the the medical marijuana bill we passed
 
02:01:36.109 --> 02:01:36.119 align:start position:0%
last week allows for possession of up to
 
02:01:37.850 --> 02:01:37.860 align:start position:0%
eight ounces plus
 
02:01:41.089 --> 02:01:41.099 align:start position:0%
um the uh the the juvenile plants that's
 
02:01:42.830 --> 02:01:42.840 align:start position:0%
a half a pound of pot
 
02:01:45.350 --> 02:01:45.360 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
02:01:47.870 --> 02:01:47.880 align:start position:0%
all this stuff doesn't jibe to me you
 
02:01:51.109 --> 02:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
know it uh you know there's uh there's
 
02:01:53.450 --> 02:01:53.460 align:start position:0%
just too many holes in this uh we've got
 
02:01:55.850 --> 02:01:55.860 align:start position:0%
to protect employers from losing their
 
02:01:58.070 --> 02:01:58.080 align:start position:0%
shirts and you know in the litigation
 
02:01:59.870 --> 02:01:59.880 align:start position:0%
end of this once again you know there's
 
02:02:02.270 --> 02:02:02.280 align:start position:0%
going to be litigation
 
02:02:05.510 --> 02:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
um you know and to to jeopardize uh you
 
02:02:07.310 --> 02:02:07.320 align:start position:0%
know somebody's life work
 
02:02:07.320 --> 02:02:08.810 align:start position:0%

02:02:25.089 --> 02:02:25.099 align:start position:0%
apologize uh to any member who
 
02:02:27.470 --> 02:02:27.480 align:start position:0%
misconstrued my previous comments in a
 
02:02:29.390 --> 02:02:29.400 align:start position:0%
disrespectful manner this has just been
 
02:02:31.609 --> 02:02:31.619 align:start position:0%
a very long debate and I briefly lost my
 
02:02:31.619 --> 02:02:32.930 align:start position:0%
a very long debate and I briefly lost my
patience

02:02:32.930 --> 02:02:32.940 align:start position:0%
patience
 
02:02:35.930 --> 02:02:35.940 align:start position:0%
um so I just want to uh say that for the
 
02:02:35.940 --> 02:02:37.010 align:start position:0%

record
 
02:02:39.950 --> 02:02:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:42.010 --> 02:02:42.020 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
02:02:43.790 --> 02:02:43.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:02:46.490 --> 02:02:46.500 align:start position:0%
I just um it will be appropriate I would
 
02:02:47.570 --> 02:02:47.580 align:start position:0%
just like
 
02:02:51.290 --> 02:02:51.300 align:start position:0%
um my colleague who's talking about
 
02:02:51.300 --> 02:02:51.950 align:start position:0%
um my colleague who's talking about
um

02:02:51.950 --> 02:02:51.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:53.229 --> 02:02:53.239 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:02:55.990 --> 02:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
pre-employment uh
 
02:03:00.350 --> 02:03:00.360 align:start position:0%
issues around the issue of drugs and how
 
02:03:03.530 --> 02:03:03.540 align:start position:0%
was that how do you square that with uh
 
02:03:06.169 --> 02:03:06.179 align:start position:0%
with the other substances that are
 
02:03:09.709 --> 02:03:09.719 align:start position:0%
prescribed uh and and how how is that
 
02:03:11.089 --> 02:03:11.099 align:start position:0%
distinction how do you make that
 
02:03:11.099 --> 02:03:14.930 align:start position:0%
distinction how do you make that
distinction

02:03:14.930 --> 02:03:14.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:18.530 --> 02:03:18.540 align:start position:0%
is it clear what I'm I'm messy is that
 
02:03:20.930 --> 02:03:20.940 align:start position:0%
appropriate Mr chairman
 
02:03:20.940 --> 02:03:22.490 align:start position:0%
appropriate Mr chairman
um

02:03:22.490 --> 02:03:22.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:23.990 --> 02:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
I'll allow the question if you'd like
 
02:03:26.149 --> 02:03:26.159 align:start position:0%
the answer representative I'm happy to
 
02:03:27.890 --> 02:03:27.900 align:start position:0%
answer it
 
02:03:29.870 --> 02:03:29.880 align:start position:0%
this bill is not addressing the other
 
02:03:32.390 --> 02:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
the other drugs that are prescribed by
 
02:03:35.930 --> 02:03:35.940 align:start position:0%
doctors and this bill is not restricting
 
02:03:38.030 --> 02:03:38.040 align:start position:0%
employers from making a decision based
 
02:03:40.010 --> 02:03:40.020 align:start position:0%
on those other drugs
 
02:03:41.390 --> 02:03:41.400 align:start position:0%
and for that reason I have a problem
 
02:03:42.950 --> 02:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
with the fact that it is pulling out
 
02:03:46.370 --> 02:03:46.380 align:start position:0%
this one drug to be a protected drug in
 
02:03:48.370 --> 02:03:48.380 align:start position:0%
the hiring process
 
02:03:50.990 --> 02:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
so for that reason
 
02:03:53.330 --> 02:03:53.340 align:start position:0%
I I find an issue with it and I don't
 
02:03:55.070 --> 02:03:55.080 align:start position:0%
feel that we're giving the employers the
 
02:03:58.070 --> 02:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
latitude to make the decisions
 
02:04:00.109 --> 02:04:00.119 align:start position:0%
representative sellers followed by
 
02:04:01.550 --> 02:04:01.560 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan thank you Mr
 
02:04:01.560 --> 02:04:02.629 align:start position:0%

chair
 
02:04:04.550 --> 02:04:04.560 align:start position:0%
you know one time I did own a small
 
02:04:07.250 --> 02:04:07.260 align:start position:0%
business and in any case here
 
02:04:10.310 --> 02:04:10.320 align:start position:0%
if this line on line six it says no
 
02:04:10.320 --> 02:04:11.990 align:start position:0%
if this line on line six it says no
employer

02:04:11.990 --> 02:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
employer
 
02:04:16.609 --> 02:04:16.619 align:start position:0%
shell deny employment all right I mean
 
02:04:18.290 --> 02:04:18.300 align:start position:0%
we're affecting thousands of businesses
 
02:04:19.609 --> 02:04:19.619 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire
 
02:04:21.530 --> 02:04:21.540 align:start position:0%
I mean and you're telling them that they
 
02:04:23.570 --> 02:04:23.580 align:start position:0%
can't deny somebody because they're on
 
02:04:27.169 --> 02:04:27.179 align:start position:0%
this therapeutic drug or what happens if
 
02:04:28.430 --> 02:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
they do say you know what I'm going to
 
02:04:29.750 --> 02:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
take a chance from this person I'm going
 
02:04:30.770 --> 02:04:30.780 align:start position:0%
to hire them
 
02:04:32.810 --> 02:04:32.820 align:start position:0%
now the next part of that sentence says
 
02:04:32.820 --> 02:04:34.250 align:start position:0%
now the next part of that sentence says
uh

02:04:34.250 --> 02:04:34.260 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:04:36.649 --> 02:04:36.659 align:start position:0%
they could terminate the employment off
 
02:04:38.510 --> 02:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
so they can't terminate the person even
 
02:04:40.550 --> 02:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
if they after they hire them so now
 
02:04:43.070 --> 02:04:43.080 align:start position:0%
they're stuck you know at this point I
 
02:04:44.750 --> 02:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
mean if you want to change the word
 
02:04:46.669 --> 02:04:46.679 align:start position:0%
shout out to me maybe you got something
 
02:04:48.770 --> 02:04:48.780 align:start position:0%
going for you
 
02:04:50.390 --> 02:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
it was up Sullivan followed by
 
02:04:52.550 --> 02:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
representative infantine
 
02:04:55.250 --> 02:04:55.260 align:start position:0%
um I think it's important to note that
 
02:04:55.260 --> 02:04:55.850 align:start position:0%
um I think it's important to note that
um

02:04:55.850 --> 02:04:55.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:58.669 --> 02:04:58.679 align:start position:0%
the uh following that no no employer
 
02:05:03.109 --> 02:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
statement it says solely because and and
 
02:05:05.870 --> 02:05:05.880 align:start position:0%
that's the the important piece so can
 
02:05:08.830 --> 02:05:08.840 align:start position:0%
you fire the um someone who's got a
 
02:05:11.870 --> 02:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis card absolutely
 
02:05:13.850 --> 02:05:13.860 align:start position:0%
just not solely because they've got the
 
02:05:13.860 --> 02:05:15.530 align:start position:0%
just not solely because they've got the
card

02:05:15.530 --> 02:05:15.540 align:start position:0%
card
 
02:05:18.290 --> 02:05:18.300 align:start position:0%
um if if they're a bad employee fire
 
02:05:18.300 --> 02:05:19.790 align:start position:0%
um if if they're a bad employee fire
them

02:05:19.790 --> 02:05:19.800 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:05:22.609 --> 02:05:22.619 align:start position:0%
um you just have to um you may have in
 
02:05:24.950 --> 02:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
some setting have to um so show some
 
02:05:26.390 --> 02:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
proof that they actually are a bad
 
02:05:29.629 --> 02:05:29.639 align:start position:0%
employee but the bottom line is
 
02:05:32.330 --> 02:05:32.340 align:start position:0%
um this only protects people
 
02:05:35.930 --> 02:05:35.940 align:start position:0%
solely because they are test positive or
 
02:05:38.390 --> 02:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
solely because they hold a card that's
 
02:05:38.400 --> 02:05:39.649 align:start position:0%
solely because they hold a card that's
it

02:05:39.649 --> 02:05:39.659 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:05:42.169 --> 02:05:42.179 align:start position:0%
um so um and the other thing I wanted to
 
02:05:44.209 --> 02:05:44.219 align:start position:0%
re-emphasize I said it way back in the
 
02:05:46.790 --> 02:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
beginning and it's been a long hearing
 
02:05:46.800 --> 02:05:47.470 align:start position:0%
beginning and it's been a long hearing
um

02:05:47.470 --> 02:05:47.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:49.850 --> 02:05:49.860 align:start position:0%
Scott Payne versus right-of-way
 
02:05:49.860 --> 02:05:51.169 align:start position:0%
Scott Payne versus right-of-way
Incorporated

02:05:51.169 --> 02:05:51.179 align:start position:0%
Incorporated
 
02:05:55.010 --> 02:05:55.020 align:start position:0%
argued October 14th opinion issued in
 
02:05:59.510 --> 02:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
January January 14 2022 that is the New
 
02:06:01.669 --> 02:06:01.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court case that
 
02:06:04.250 --> 02:06:04.260 align:start position:0%
provides that some was someone is
 
02:06:07.609 --> 02:06:07.619 align:start position:0%
entitled to accommodation for their use
 
02:06:10.729 --> 02:06:10.739 align:start position:0%
of cannabis under the therapeutic
 
02:06:13.550 --> 02:06:13.560 align:start position:0%
cannabis program so
 
02:06:17.990 --> 02:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
we need to we need to remember that the
 
02:06:19.850 --> 02:06:19.860 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court has already decided on
 
02:06:19.860 --> 02:06:21.050 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court has already decided on
this

02:06:21.050 --> 02:06:21.060 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:06:24.290 --> 02:06:24.300 align:start position:0%
this statute simply helps someone from
 
02:06:25.790 --> 02:06:25.800 align:start position:0%
not having to go back to the court
 
02:06:28.729 --> 02:06:28.739 align:start position:0%
system to enforce their rights to
 
02:06:31.010 --> 02:06:31.020 align:start position:0%
accommodation under the therapeutic
 
02:06:32.330 --> 02:06:32.340 align:start position:0%
cannabis program
 
02:06:34.490 --> 02:06:34.500 align:start position:0%
there's the rights they already have
 
02:06:36.770 --> 02:06:36.780 align:start position:0%
we're not giving them anything that they
 
02:06:40.850 --> 02:06:40.860 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:42.830 --> 02:06:42.840 align:start position:0%
I want to move this along we have an
 
02:06:44.270 --> 02:06:44.280 align:start position:0%
amendment I'd like to vote of the
 
02:06:46.669 --> 02:06:46.679 align:start position:0%
amendment uh it may surprise some of you
 
02:06:51.430 --> 02:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:55.669 --> 02:06:55.679 align:start position:0%
and sometimes we agree and we we agree
 
02:06:57.830 --> 02:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
more than we disagree and sometimes we
 
02:07:00.530 --> 02:07:00.540 align:start position:0%
make agreements to do things
 
02:07:02.570 --> 02:07:02.580 align:start position:0%
because it's the best for either a piece
 
02:07:04.129 --> 02:07:04.139 align:start position:0%
of legislation or something moving
 
02:07:07.310 --> 02:07:07.320 align:start position:0%
forward to get something done
 
02:07:11.390 --> 02:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
and I have
 
02:07:13.189 --> 02:07:13.199 align:start position:0%
told representative Sullivan I will
 
02:07:16.250 --> 02:07:16.260 align:start position:0%
support his Amendment
 
02:07:19.209 --> 02:07:19.219 align:start position:0%
today I have issues with the bill
 
02:07:22.010 --> 02:07:22.020 align:start position:0%
overall which I'll speak about if this
 
02:07:24.070 --> 02:07:24.080 align:start position:0%
amendment passes
 
02:07:27.290 --> 02:07:27.300 align:start position:0%
but this takes
 
02:07:27.300 --> 02:07:30.050 align:start position:0%
but this takes
um

02:07:30.050 --> 02:07:30.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:32.570 --> 02:07:32.580 align:start position:0%
some of the issues with
 
02:07:35.990 --> 02:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
um with the original bill that's not
 
02:07:37.550 --> 02:07:37.560 align:start position:0%
perfect but it takes a lot of those
 
02:07:40.310 --> 02:07:40.320 align:start position:0%
things and makes them better
 
02:07:43.189 --> 02:07:43.199 align:start position:0%
so I will be supporting
 
02:07:44.629 --> 02:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
the amendment and I'll come back
 
02:07:48.830 --> 02:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:52.430 --> 02:07:52.440 align:start position:0%
follows to discuss some of the other
 
02:07:55.430 --> 02:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
parts of the bill but um I just wanted
 
02:07:57.770 --> 02:07:57.780 align:start position:0%
people to know that we actually do
 
02:08:01.129 --> 02:08:01.139 align:start position:0%
come to agreement when we can on things
 
02:08:03.609 --> 02:08:03.619 align:start position:0%
agreed to make things
 
02:08:06.410 --> 02:08:06.420 align:start position:0%
move because ultimately
 
02:08:06.420 --> 02:08:07.310 align:start position:0%
move because ultimately
um

02:08:07.310 --> 02:08:07.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:08.629 --> 02:08:08.639 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of times we will
 
02:08:10.129 --> 02:08:10.139 align:start position:0%
disagree but ultimately want to get a
 
02:08:12.290 --> 02:08:12.300 align:start position:0%
bill passed so that being said if
 
02:08:13.790 --> 02:08:13.800 align:start position:0%
there's not a lot more discussion I'd
 
02:08:16.129 --> 02:08:16.139 align:start position:0%
like the clerk to to consider calling
 
02:08:18.290 --> 02:08:18.300 align:start position:0%
the role the motion on the floor has
 
02:08:20.510 --> 02:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
been moved and seconded there's been
 
02:08:22.189 --> 02:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
some discussion unless I see any other
 
02:08:24.530 --> 02:08:24.540 align:start position:0%
last minute comments I'd like the clerk
 
02:08:26.390 --> 02:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
to call the role if you're in favor of
 
02:08:27.830 --> 02:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
the amendment you'll be voting yes if
 
02:08:31.010 --> 02:08:31.020 align:start position:0%

it would have been made and seconded uh
 
02:10:04.020 --> 02:10:04.850 align:start position:0%
it would have been made and seconded uh

02:10:04.860 --> 02:10:05.450 align:start position:0%
your
um

02:10:05.450 --> 02:10:05.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:08.149 --> 02:10:08.159 align:start position:0%
recognize the speaker motion
 
02:10:11.270 --> 02:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
um I'll keep it brief we've beaten this
 
02:10:13.070 --> 02:10:13.080 align:start position:0%
one nearly to death
 
02:10:15.350 --> 02:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
um the um
 
02:10:17.810 --> 02:10:17.820 align:start position:0%
as I said a little while ago the
 
02:10:20.330 --> 02:10:20.340 align:start position:0%
amendment replaces the entire bill with
 
02:10:22.550 --> 02:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
the exception of the effective date so
 
02:10:24.709 --> 02:10:24.719 align:start position:0%
and when we have been discussing
 
02:10:26.330 --> 02:10:26.340 align:start position:0%
um the bill
 
02:10:28.129 --> 02:10:28.139 align:start position:0%
um I believe it's a good bill
 
02:10:32.510 --> 02:10:32.520 align:start position:0%
um I think as I said a minute ago it
 
02:10:34.970 --> 02:10:34.980 align:start position:0%
simply puts in statute rights that
 
02:10:37.189 --> 02:10:37.199 align:start position:0%

pass I will be voting against this
 
02:10:58.920 --> 02:11:00.350 align:start position:0%
pass I will be voting against this
um

02:11:00.350 --> 02:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:04.010 --> 02:11:04.020 align:start position:0%
cannabis is still a not legal at the
 
02:11:06.770 --> 02:11:06.780 align:start position:0%
federal level and we should not be tying
 
02:11:09.649 --> 02:11:09.659 align:start position:0%
our employers hands with a job offer to
 
02:11:13.550 --> 02:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
force them to hire somebody that may be
 
02:11:15.950 --> 02:11:15.960 align:start position:0%
a risk to their employment or to their
 
02:11:19.370 --> 02:11:19.380 align:start position:0%
their business and um
 
02:11:26.089 --> 02:11:26.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:29.570 --> 02:11:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:29.580 --> 02:11:30.790 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:11:30.790 --> 02:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:33.830 --> 02:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
I am a supporter of therapeutic cannabis
 
02:11:33.840 --> 02:11:35.330 align:start position:0%
I am a supporter of therapeutic cannabis
use

02:11:35.330 --> 02:11:35.340 align:start position:0%
use
 
02:11:35.340 --> 02:11:36.410 align:start position:0%
use
um

02:11:36.410 --> 02:11:36.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:39.050 --> 02:11:39.060 align:start position:0%
for a lot of reasons I know how it's
 
02:11:41.270 --> 02:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
helped individuals
 
02:11:43.010 --> 02:11:43.020 align:start position:0%
former state representative who's a
 
02:11:44.330 --> 02:11:44.340 align:start position:0%
friend of mine who was one of the
 
02:11:47.270 --> 02:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
individuals who was worked very hard on
 
02:11:49.070 --> 02:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:11:49.080 --> 02:11:50.750 align:start position:0%
this bill
um

02:11:50.750 --> 02:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:53.089 --> 02:11:53.099 align:start position:0%
I I sat down with him last Friday night
 
02:11:55.430 --> 02:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
it cost me a couple beers but it was
 
02:11:58.010 --> 02:11:58.020 align:start position:0%
worth the conversation
 
02:11:59.629 --> 02:11:59.639 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that disturbs me
 
02:12:02.510 --> 02:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
is you you when you get your
 
02:12:04.250 --> 02:12:04.260 align:start position:0%
allotment because we can't call it a
 
02:12:04.260 --> 02:12:05.149 align:start position:0%
allotment because we can't call it a
prescription

02:12:05.149 --> 02:12:05.159 align:start position:0%
prescription
 
02:12:07.729 --> 02:12:07.739 align:start position:0%
that's what it is for the month
 
02:12:09.830 --> 02:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
and you can use it as you kind of see
 
02:12:09.840 --> 02:12:10.790 align:start position:0%
and you can use it as you kind of see
fit

02:12:10.790 --> 02:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
fit
 
02:12:14.030 --> 02:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
and I asked him well were you under the
 
02:12:14.040 --> 02:12:15.589 align:start position:0%
and I asked him well were you under the
influence

02:12:15.589 --> 02:12:15.599 align:start position:0%
influence
 
02:12:17.270 --> 02:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
and when you would when you would go to
 
02:12:21.770 --> 02:12:21.780 align:start position:0%
work and it goes well of course I was
 
02:12:21.780 --> 02:12:22.810 align:start position:0%
work and it goes well of course I was
um

02:12:22.810 --> 02:12:22.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:25.910 --> 02:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
to what degree
 
02:12:27.530 --> 02:12:27.540 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
02:12:30.169 --> 02:12:30.179 align:start position:0%
uh so he wasn't sure
 
02:12:33.350 --> 02:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
uh I have had three deaths uh while I'm
 
02:12:36.169 --> 02:12:36.179 align:start position:0%
been an insurance agent and uh all of
 
02:12:37.550 --> 02:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
them were big workers compensation
 
02:12:39.229 --> 02:12:39.239 align:start position:0%
messes because all of them had marijuana
 
02:12:42.169 --> 02:12:42.179 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:44.030 --> 02:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
um what happens in the real world when
 
02:12:46.129 --> 02:12:46.139 align:start position:0%
when an accident happens
 
02:12:48.410 --> 02:12:48.420 align:start position:0%
is that blood tests are taken especially
 
02:12:50.149 --> 02:12:50.159 align:start position:0%
when someone's severely injured or
 
02:12:50.159 --> 02:12:51.290 align:start position:0%
when someone's severely injured or
killed

02:12:51.290 --> 02:12:51.300 align:start position:0%
killed
 
02:12:54.950 --> 02:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
and then it becomes a big liability
 
02:12:59.089 --> 02:12:59.099 align:start position:0%
problem for everybody all over the place
 
02:12:59.099 --> 02:12:59.870 align:start position:0%
problem for everybody all over the place
um

02:12:59.870 --> 02:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:02.569 --> 02:13:02.579 align:start position:0%
and that that really concerns me
 
02:13:04.490 --> 02:13:04.500 align:start position:0%
um the Supreme Court case
 
02:13:07.729 --> 02:13:07.739 align:start position:0%
really great read I I really hope a lot
 
02:13:09.530 --> 02:13:09.540 align:start position:0%
of you read that I really also hope a
 
02:13:10.750 --> 02:13:10.760 align:start position:0%
lot of you read
 
02:13:13.850 --> 02:13:13.860 align:start position:0%
126x3 and if you haven't
 
02:13:13.860 --> 02:13:14.569 align:start position:0%
126x3 and if you haven't
um

02:13:14.569 --> 02:13:14.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:16.010 --> 02:13:16.020 align:start position:0%
you're missing out on something it's
 
02:13:18.530 --> 02:13:18.540 align:start position:0%
it's really important and now
 
02:13:21.169 --> 02:13:21.179 align:start position:0%
information to have but since we have a
 
02:13:22.790 --> 02:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
resident Supreme Court Justice in our
 
02:13:25.430 --> 02:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
midst uh in the house session last week
 
02:13:27.109 --> 02:13:27.119 align:start position:0%
I asked him to read the bill
 
02:13:28.310 --> 02:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna ask them to give me his
 
02:13:28.320 --> 02:13:29.689 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna ask them to give me his
opinion

02:13:29.689 --> 02:13:29.699 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
02:13:32.209 --> 02:13:32.219 align:start position:0%
and he said yes it is a reasonable
 
02:13:32.219 --> 02:13:33.770 align:start position:0%
and he said yes it is a reasonable
accommodation

02:13:33.770 --> 02:13:33.780 align:start position:0%
accommodation
 
02:13:33.780 --> 02:13:35.089 align:start position:0%
accommodation
for

02:13:35.089 --> 02:13:35.099 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:13:35.099 --> 02:13:38.030 align:start position:0%
for
PTSD

02:13:38.030 --> 02:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
PTSD
 
02:13:39.770 --> 02:13:39.780 align:start position:0%
it didn't say
 
02:13:41.390 --> 02:13:41.400 align:start position:0%
that you're entitled to hire somebody
 
02:13:46.250 --> 02:13:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:47.569 --> 02:13:47.579 align:start position:0%
it said it was a reasonable
 
02:13:47.579 --> 02:13:49.910 align:start position:0%
it said it was a reasonable
accommodation

02:13:49.910 --> 02:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
accommodation
 
02:13:53.450 --> 02:13:53.460 align:start position:0%
okay for for to be able to use it okay
 
02:13:55.550 --> 02:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
we have two different issues here one is
 
02:13:57.770 --> 02:13:57.780 align:start position:0%
basically saying you you can't be the
 
02:13:59.629 --> 02:13:59.639 align:start position:0%
sole purpose that you deny the nothing
 
02:14:01.310 --> 02:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
that's silent it's not even discussed in
 
02:14:04.069 --> 02:14:04.079 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court ruling
 
02:14:04.079 --> 02:14:05.089 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court ruling
um

02:14:05.089 --> 02:14:05.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:05.099 --> 02:14:06.890 align:start position:0%
um
the

02:14:06.890 --> 02:14:06.900 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:14:06.900 --> 02:14:10.310 align:start position:0%
the
um

02:14:10.310 --> 02:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:12.729 --> 02:14:12.739 align:start position:0%
the fact that you're not allowing
 
02:14:16.089 --> 02:14:16.099 align:start position:0%
certain companies
 
02:14:19.189 --> 02:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
to say no
 
02:14:22.310 --> 02:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
we don't allow that here I have a
 
02:14:23.450 --> 02:14:23.460 align:start position:0%
problem with
 
02:14:25.790 --> 02:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
because the amendment which I just voted
 
02:14:25.800 --> 02:14:27.229 align:start position:0%
because the amendment which I just voted
for

02:14:27.229 --> 02:14:27.239 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:14:30.050 --> 02:14:30.060 align:start position:0%
if I'm going to be consistent
 
02:14:30.060 --> 02:14:32.270 align:start position:0%
if I'm going to be consistent
excludes

02:14:32.270 --> 02:14:32.280 align:start position:0%
excludes
 
02:14:34.250 --> 02:14:34.260 align:start position:0%
Emergency Medical Services law
 
02:14:37.550 --> 02:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
enforcement Public Safety firefighters
 
02:14:37.560 --> 02:14:40.609 align:start position:0%
enforcement Public Safety firefighters
why

02:14:40.609 --> 02:14:40.619 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:44.089 --> 02:14:44.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:46.129 --> 02:14:46.139 align:start position:0%
because their bosses wanted it hey I'm
 
02:14:47.689 --> 02:14:47.699 align:start position:0%
right there with you I agree
 
02:14:50.089 --> 02:14:50.099 align:start position:0%
okay I'm not saying I disagree
 
02:14:52.310 --> 02:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
but why can't I
 
02:14:55.069 --> 02:14:55.079 align:start position:0%
as a business owner but they can
 
02:14:57.410 --> 02:14:57.420 align:start position:0%
Federal contracts I agree has to be in
 
02:14:58.910 --> 02:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
there why it's against the law
 
02:15:02.030 --> 02:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
Federalist against the law
 
02:15:06.410 --> 02:15:06.420 align:start position:0%
so we've given certain carve outs for
 
02:15:08.810 --> 02:15:08.820 align:start position:0%
some but not all
 
02:15:11.689 --> 02:15:11.699 align:start position:0%
we're using a Supreme Court
 
02:15:15.229 --> 02:15:15.239 align:start position:0%
ruling that says this
 
02:15:17.450 --> 02:15:17.460 align:start position:0%
and it's right
 
02:15:20.450 --> 02:15:20.460 align:start position:0%
that Supreme Court ruling by our law
 
02:15:24.830 --> 02:15:24.840 align:start position:0%
section 126 X3 is right
 
02:15:27.350 --> 02:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
they got it right
 
02:15:30.890 --> 02:15:30.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:34.850 --> 02:15:34.860 align:start position:0%
you can get solely
 
02:15:37.310 --> 02:15:37.320 align:start position:0%
hire someone because they're have that
 
02:15:37.320 --> 02:15:38.569 align:start position:0%
hire someone because they're have that
card

02:15:38.569 --> 02:15:38.579 align:start position:0%
card
 
02:15:42.229 --> 02:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
I wanted I advocated I lobbied to get
 
02:15:43.490 --> 02:15:43.500 align:start position:0%
this retained
 
02:15:46.069 --> 02:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
not because I'm trying to waste time
 
02:15:48.709 --> 02:15:48.719 align:start position:0%
but as we've seen today some things are
 
02:15:51.410 --> 02:15:51.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:56.870 --> 02:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:59.510 --> 02:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
but there's but you can't give it to
 
02:16:01.310 --> 02:16:01.320 align:start position:0%
some and not the others
 
02:16:03.350 --> 02:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
and as soon as you added the exclusions
 
02:16:06.169 --> 02:16:06.179 align:start position:0%
for other people
 
02:16:10.250 --> 02:16:10.260 align:start position:0%
and not the others what have you done
 
02:16:11.990 --> 02:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
so I
 
02:16:15.229 --> 02:16:15.239 align:start position:0%
with a heavy heart I will not support
 
02:16:18.350 --> 02:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:21.410 --> 02:16:21.420 align:start position:0%
something close to it is the right thing
 
02:16:22.430 --> 02:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
to do
 
02:16:24.050 --> 02:16:24.060 align:start position:0%
but I don't feel this is the right one
 
02:16:24.060 --> 02:16:28.970 align:start position:0%
but I don't feel this is the right one
yet

02:16:28.970 --> 02:16:28.980 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:31.609 --> 02:16:31.619 align:start position:0%
any other hands up
 
02:16:33.610 --> 02:16:33.620 align:start position:0%
representative kale
 
02:16:37.009 --> 02:16:37.019 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I I understand your
 
02:16:39.349 --> 02:16:39.359 align:start position:0%
concerns and I also understand the
 
02:16:41.089 --> 02:16:41.099 align:start position:0%
concerns of people who would want to
 
02:16:45.190 --> 02:16:45.200 align:start position:0%
exclude those people who are excluded
 
02:16:48.530 --> 02:16:48.540 align:start position:0%
but I wonder if this is something that a
 
02:16:50.870 --> 02:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
situation where we would let uh
 
02:16:53.629 --> 02:16:53.639 align:start position:0%
we would let this the other body try to
 
02:16:56.570 --> 02:16:56.580 align:start position:0%
work that out because it is so close in
 
02:16:58.490 --> 02:16:58.500 align:start position:0%
in your mind that something that we
 
02:17:07.969 --> 02:17:07.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:12.110 --> 02:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
if that if that had been afforded to me
 
02:17:14.570 --> 02:17:14.580 align:start position:0%
um on other things I would have done
 
02:17:17.209 --> 02:17:17.219 align:start position:0%
that but we we have a job here to do it
 
02:17:19.969 --> 02:17:19.979 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to do it and and um
 
02:17:23.030 --> 02:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
and uh my opinion this is what I think
 
02:17:25.490 --> 02:17:25.500 align:start position:0%
could happen you know just let's not
 
02:17:27.110 --> 02:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
talk about policy let's talk about
 
02:17:27.120 --> 02:17:28.370 align:start position:0%
talk about policy let's talk about
politics

02:17:28.370 --> 02:17:28.380 align:start position:0%
politics
 
02:17:29.389 --> 02:17:29.399 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:17:31.070 --> 02:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
this is going to come out here 10 to 10
 
02:17:31.080 --> 02:17:32.690 align:start position:0%
this is going to come out here 10 to 10
probably

02:17:32.690 --> 02:17:32.700 align:start position:0%
probably
 
02:17:35.690 --> 02:17:35.700 align:start position:0%
so they go to the house floor
 
02:17:37.669 --> 02:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
who knows
 
02:17:39.230 --> 02:17:39.240 align:start position:0%
the house overwhelmingly passed
 
02:17:39.240 --> 02:17:40.370 align:start position:0%
the house overwhelmingly passed
marijuana

02:17:40.370 --> 02:17:40.380 align:start position:0%
marijuana
 
02:17:42.469 --> 02:17:42.479 align:start position:0%
a couple weeks ago they may be right
 
02:17:45.349 --> 02:17:45.359 align:start position:0%
along with this one don't know
 
02:17:48.709 --> 02:17:48.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:52.070 --> 02:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
I how divided the house is how divided
 
02:17:53.929 --> 02:17:53.939 align:start position:0%
the committee is how it goes to the
 
02:17:55.549 --> 02:17:55.559 align:start position:0%
Senate versus coming out of the house
 
02:17:57.770 --> 02:17:57.780 align:start position:0%
unanimous on the consent
 
02:17:59.270 --> 02:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
I don't know what's going to happen over
 
02:18:01.310 --> 02:18:01.320 align:start position:0%
there we all know what happens with the
 
02:18:02.990 --> 02:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
Senate at the end of the term
 
02:18:04.669 --> 02:18:04.679 align:start position:0%
we're going to yank a budget out we're
 
02:18:05.870 --> 02:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
going to send it over to them are they
 
02:18:07.070 --> 02:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
going to have time to want to deal with
 
02:18:09.349 --> 02:18:09.359 align:start position:0%
it I don't know
 
02:18:11.570 --> 02:18:11.580 align:start position:0%
that's the that's the
 
02:18:14.690 --> 02:18:14.700 align:start position:0%
that's the political realization of a
 
02:18:17.209 --> 02:18:17.219 align:start position:0%
situation we're in
 
02:18:19.610 --> 02:18:19.620 align:start position:0%
I would rather we get it done right
 
02:18:21.469 --> 02:18:21.479 align:start position:0%
and I'm not trying to kick this can down
 
02:18:23.230 --> 02:18:23.240 align:start position:0%
the road
 
02:18:26.870 --> 02:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
we have made agreements at OSHA I'm not
 
02:18:28.129 --> 02:18:28.139 align:start position:0%
saying we made agreement on this but
 
02:18:29.509 --> 02:18:29.519 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan and I have
 
02:18:29.519 --> 02:18:31.549 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan and I have
agreed

02:18:31.549 --> 02:18:31.559 align:start position:0%
agreed
 
02:18:34.730 --> 02:18:34.740 align:start position:0%
um that OSHA is very close
 
02:18:36.410 --> 02:18:36.420 align:start position:0%
um he hasn't agreement on this one but I
 
02:18:39.709 --> 02:18:39.719 align:start position:0%
feel the same way on that on this
 
02:18:41.030 --> 02:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
um you got to take a couple things out
 
02:18:42.650 --> 02:18:42.660 align:start position:0%
and you gotta
 
02:18:45.650 --> 02:18:45.660 align:start position:0%
um put a few things in
 
02:18:45.660 --> 02:18:47.209 align:start position:0%
um put a few things in
um

02:18:47.209 --> 02:18:47.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:47.219 --> 02:18:48.950 align:start position:0%
um
so

02:18:48.950 --> 02:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:18:48.960 --> 02:18:51.589 align:start position:0%
so
um

02:18:51.589 --> 02:18:51.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:53.209 --> 02:18:53.219 align:start position:0%
you know as far as I'm concerned
 
02:18:55.009 --> 02:18:55.019 align:start position:0%
whatever the committee wants to do the
 
02:18:56.509 --> 02:18:56.519 align:start position:0%
committee is going to but my vote today
 
02:18:58.370 --> 02:18:58.380 align:start position:0%
unfortunately is going to be no
 
02:19:00.049 --> 02:19:00.059 align:start position:0%
representative Susie
 
02:19:02.509 --> 02:19:02.519 align:start position:0%
just clarification so we'll get the odd
 
02:19:04.730 --> 02:19:04.740 align:start position:0%
to pass as amended if that doesn't
 
02:19:04.740 --> 02:19:06.469 align:start position:0%
to pass as amended if that doesn't
succeed

02:19:06.469 --> 02:19:06.479 align:start position:0%
succeed
 
02:19:09.169 --> 02:19:09.179 align:start position:0%
can we still make the motion to retain
 
02:19:11.270 --> 02:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
I will okay I'm not going to go with the
 
02:19:11.280 --> 02:19:13.730 align:start position:0%
I will okay I'm not going to go with the
Ito

02:19:13.730 --> 02:19:13.740 align:start position:0%
Ito
 
02:19:13.740 --> 02:19:15.049 align:start position:0%
Ito
Representatives

02:19:15.049 --> 02:19:15.059 align:start position:0%
Representatives
 
02:19:15.059 --> 02:19:16.009 align:start position:0%
Representatives
um

02:19:16.009 --> 02:19:16.019 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:16.019 --> 02:19:18.469 align:start position:0%
um
love

02:19:18.469 --> 02:19:18.479 align:start position:0%
love
 
02:19:21.650 --> 02:19:21.660 align:start position:0%
just a clarification uh Mr chair you uh
 
02:19:23.450 --> 02:19:23.460 align:start position:0%
you mentioned about a a monthly
 
02:19:26.030 --> 02:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
allotment and we just passed a bill
 
02:19:27.830 --> 02:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
that's going to allow eight uh eight
 
02:19:29.270 --> 02:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
ounces of marijuana to be in your
 
02:19:31.549 --> 02:19:31.559 align:start position:0%
possession uh that fire exceeds any
 
02:19:35.030 --> 02:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
monthly allotment is I'm just guessing
 
02:19:36.770 --> 02:19:36.780 align:start position:0%
that that would
 
02:19:39.049 --> 02:19:39.059 align:start position:0%
um and also we've heard testimony about
 
02:19:41.389 --> 02:19:41.399 align:start position:0%
um you know that marijuana can be uh it
 
02:19:43.610 --> 02:19:43.620 align:start position:0%
can be engineered to to work on one
 
02:19:45.950 --> 02:19:45.960 align:start position:0%
disease and not get you high and of that
 
02:19:48.710 --> 02:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
high or whatever and uh because we
 
02:19:50.570 --> 02:19:50.580 align:start position:0%
passed this bill and it's going to be
 
02:19:53.450 --> 02:19:53.460 align:start position:0%
allow allowed for homegrown uh so the
 
02:19:56.510 --> 02:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
the engineering of uh of the Cannabis is
 
02:19:59.210 --> 02:19:59.220 align:start position:0%
not going to take place uh once again
 
02:20:01.250 --> 02:20:01.260 align:start position:0%
this can of worms that we're opening up
 
02:20:04.610 --> 02:20:04.620 align:start position:0%
uh I I can't I can't vote for it
 
02:20:04.620 --> 02:20:08.690 align:start position:0%
uh I I can't I can't vote for it
manager

02:20:08.690 --> 02:20:08.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:11.270 --> 02:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
okay Mr chairman I would disagree with
 
02:20:13.910 --> 02:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
the idea that the bill is very close I
 
02:20:16.130 --> 02:20:16.140 align:start position:0%
happen to believe that it's there
 
02:20:16.140 --> 02:20:17.770 align:start position:0%
happen to believe that it's there
um

02:20:17.770 --> 02:20:17.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:21.110 --> 02:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
like I referenced earlier it has the
 
02:20:23.990 --> 02:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
same language that pertains to all other
 
02:20:28.130 --> 02:20:28.140 align:start position:0%
uh non-discrimination bills
 
02:20:31.270 --> 02:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
um the a lot of our civil rights
 
02:20:34.190 --> 02:20:34.200 align:start position:0%
legislation in the United States doesn't
 
02:20:37.610 --> 02:20:37.620 align:start position:0%
say you have to hire ex-member of a
 
02:20:40.610 --> 02:20:40.620 align:start position:0%
protected class it says you can that
 
02:20:42.530 --> 02:20:42.540 align:start position:0%
member being a protected class is not
 
02:20:44.870 --> 02:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
the reason why you can't hire them if
 
02:20:46.190 --> 02:20:46.200 align:start position:0%
there are other factors then you're not
 
02:20:48.230 --> 02:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
allowed to hire them we've had the
 
02:20:50.630 --> 02:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
discussion about Job performance you
 
02:20:52.730 --> 02:20:52.740 align:start position:0%
know if somebody drives a forklift into
 
02:20:54.290 --> 02:20:54.300 align:start position:0%
a wall
 
02:20:58.309 --> 02:20:58.319 align:start position:0%
um or performs uh their job not well
 
02:21:01.309 --> 02:21:01.319 align:start position:0%
that is subject for termination it just
 
02:21:04.010 --> 02:21:04.020 align:start position:0%
can't be the sole reason is that they're
 
02:21:06.290 --> 02:21:06.300 align:start position:0%
a card carrier or they have a positive
 
02:21:09.050 --> 02:21:09.060 align:start position:0%
drug test for cannabis
 
02:21:12.590 --> 02:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
this bill we've had for two months the
 
02:21:14.090 --> 02:21:14.100 align:start position:0%
bill went to a subcommittee I think the
 
02:21:18.590 --> 02:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
subcommittee had a good look at it this
 
02:21:20.630 --> 02:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
amendment was produced
 
02:21:24.650 --> 02:21:24.660 align:start position:0%
um so I would hope that we could uh send
 
02:21:27.889 --> 02:21:27.899 align:start position:0%
it ought to pass in lieu of a retained
 
02:21:27.899 --> 02:21:35.570 align:start position:0%
it ought to pass in lieu of a retained
motion

02:21:35.570 --> 02:21:35.580 align:start position:0%

02:21:44.330 --> 02:21:44.340 align:start position:0%
uh there's a motion on the floor
 
02:21:46.190 --> 02:21:46.200 align:start position:0%
ought to pass with Amendment
 
02:21:48.130 --> 02:21:48.140 align:start position:0%
has been made by representative Sullivan
 
02:21:51.230 --> 02:21:51.240 align:start position:0%

02:23:32.450 --> 02:23:32.460 align:start position:0%
I would agree that I think this bill is
 
02:23:33.770 --> 02:23:33.780 align:start position:0%
very close and I'm going to say this
 
02:23:33.780 --> 02:23:35.389 align:start position:0%
very close and I'm going to say this
because

02:23:35.389 --> 02:23:35.399 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:23:35.399 --> 02:23:36.889 align:start position:0%
because
um

02:23:36.889 --> 02:23:36.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:38.389 --> 02:23:38.399 align:start position:0%
but not that I think we should do other
 
02:23:40.070 --> 02:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
things or do this because other places
 
02:23:42.290 --> 02:23:42.300 align:start position:0%
do it but there's 25 States
 
02:23:45.050 --> 02:23:45.060 align:start position:0%
that currently do this
 
02:23:47.630 --> 02:23:47.640 align:start position:0%
um so I think somewhere along the line
 
02:23:49.910 --> 02:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
I think we can find a solution to help
 
02:23:51.170 --> 02:23:51.180 align:start position:0%
the people that are on therapeutic
 
02:23:53.090 --> 02:23:53.100 align:start position:0%
cannabis um
 
02:23:56.510 --> 02:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
program and I look at it and some of the
 
02:23:59.150 --> 02:23:59.160 align:start position:0%
conversations that we had during the
 
02:23:59.160 --> 02:24:01.210 align:start position:0%
conversations that we had during the
subcommittee

02:24:01.210 --> 02:24:01.220 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
02:24:04.190 --> 02:24:04.200 align:start position:0%
and I kept re-emphasizing the fact that
 
02:24:06.170 --> 02:24:06.180 align:start position:0%
I understand everybody's opinion and I
 
02:24:08.450 --> 02:24:08.460 align:start position:0%
respect everybody's opinion but I don't
 
02:24:10.250 --> 02:24:10.260 align:start position:0%
really think that the people in the
 
02:24:13.270 --> 02:24:13.280 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program
 
02:24:16.490 --> 02:24:16.500 align:start position:0%
and not all there may be some but I
 
02:24:18.230 --> 02:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
don't believe it's people that are
 
02:24:20.570 --> 02:24:20.580 align:start position:0%
trying to abuse marijuana because I can
 
02:24:22.429 --> 02:24:22.439 align:start position:0%
tell you in New Hampshire
 
02:24:25.010 --> 02:24:25.020 align:start position:0%
if you want marijuana you can go to the
 
02:24:26.510 --> 02:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
three states surrounding us
 
02:24:28.550 --> 02:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
you don't have to get a therapeutic
 
02:24:31.730 --> 02:24:31.740 align:start position:0%
cannabis card so it is everywhere
 
02:24:34.309 --> 02:24:34.319 align:start position:0%
um do I think the bill that you know the
 
02:24:35.990 --> 02:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
legalization is going to happen here who
 
02:24:38.690 --> 02:24:38.700 align:start position:0%
knows but at the end of the day I truly
 
02:24:40.130 --> 02:24:40.140 align:start position:0%
believe that therapeutic cannabis
 
02:24:42.290 --> 02:24:42.300 align:start position:0%
program is to alleviate some of the
 
02:24:45.110 --> 02:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
anxiety of people that may have
 
02:24:47.690 --> 02:24:47.700 align:start position:0%
um may use opioids and are trying to get
 
02:24:47.700 --> 02:24:48.710 align:start position:0%
um may use opioids and are trying to get
off

02:24:48.710 --> 02:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
off
 
02:24:51.050 --> 02:24:51.060 align:start position:0%
using those opioids and this may be a
 
02:24:53.270 --> 02:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
better way for them to do it and I you
 
02:24:55.610 --> 02:24:55.620 align:start position:0%
know I understand people's feelings and
 
02:24:57.830 --> 02:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
anxieties toward you know what happens
 
02:25:00.230 --> 02:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
at work 29 years in a fire service seen
 
02:25:04.250 --> 02:25:04.260 align:start position:0%
many many accidents DWIs uh accidents
 
02:25:06.349 --> 02:25:06.359 align:start position:0%
that were caused by alcohol accidents
 
02:25:08.150 --> 02:25:08.160 align:start position:0%
caused by drugs
 
02:25:08.160 --> 02:25:08.750 align:start position:0%
caused by drugs
um

02:25:08.750 --> 02:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:10.730 --> 02:25:10.740 align:start position:0%
if anybody in here thinks for one second
 
02:25:13.190 --> 02:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
that this is not happening right now
 
02:25:15.590 --> 02:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
um I have news for you it's happening in
 
02:25:17.690 --> 02:25:17.700 align:start position:0%
almost every industry
 
02:25:19.429 --> 02:25:19.439 align:start position:0%
um out there
 
02:25:22.550 --> 02:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
so retaining the bill I think is a good
 
02:25:24.590 --> 02:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
idea I think it needs some tweaks I
 
02:25:26.750 --> 02:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
think we can work on it like I said if
 
02:25:28.790 --> 02:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
25 other states across the country can
 
02:25:30.650 --> 02:25:30.660 align:start position:0%
do this I think New Hampshire can find
 
02:25:33.290 --> 02:25:33.300 align:start position:0%
some uh Common Ground between all of us
 
02:25:35.150 --> 02:25:35.160 align:start position:0%
to uh try to get a good bill passed
 
02:25:39.550 --> 02:25:39.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:42.349 --> 02:25:42.359 align:start position:0%
foreign thank you Mr chairman I'm going
 
02:25:44.809 --> 02:25:44.819 align:start position:0%
to oppose retaining I just want patience
 
02:25:46.429 --> 02:25:46.439 align:start position:0%
of the therapeutic cannabis program to
 
02:25:48.469 --> 02:25:48.479 align:start position:0%
be able to go to work uh and support
 
02:25:50.210 --> 02:25:50.220 align:start position:0%
themselves because the alternative is
 
02:25:51.650 --> 02:25:51.660 align:start position:0%
they're going to end up on the state
 
02:25:53.809 --> 02:25:53.819 align:start position:0%
unemployment system and
 
02:25:56.030 --> 02:25:56.040 align:start position:0%
um I
 
02:26:03.410 --> 02:26:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:06.830 --> 02:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
uh Madam Clerk thank you Mr chair
 
02:26:09.530 --> 02:26:09.540 align:start position:0%
um I'm gonna join him in that vote uh no
 
02:26:12.230 --> 02:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
because I think that it should go to the
 
02:26:13.250 --> 02:26:13.260 align:start position:0%
house floor
 
02:26:20.990 --> 02:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:23.330 --> 02:26:23.340 align:start position:0%
I agree with um there was a
 
02:26:25.070 --> 02:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
representative Susie
 
02:26:29.450 --> 02:26:29.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:34.150 --> 02:26:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:36.290 --> 02:26:36.300 align:start position:0%
they are in pain
 
02:26:39.410 --> 02:26:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:39.420 --> 02:26:40.670 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:26:40.670 --> 02:26:40.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:43.550 --> 02:26:43.560 align:start position:0%
I wish my dad had it as he died of a
 
02:26:46.370 --> 02:26:46.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:49.490 --> 02:26:49.500 align:start position:0%
so I'm in favor of it
 
02:26:51.290 --> 02:26:51.300 align:start position:0%
but we do need to tweak it and I will
 
02:26:51.300 --> 02:26:52.910 align:start position:0%
but we do need to tweak it and I will
support

02:26:52.910 --> 02:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
support
 
02:26:56.510 --> 02:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
but you make a valid very valid point
 
02:26:58.969 --> 02:26:58.979 align:start position:0%
we want these people to be able to work
 
02:27:00.610 --> 02:27:00.620 align:start position:0%
and right now by the Supreme Court
 
02:27:03.349 --> 02:27:03.359 align:start position:0%
ruling they can work
 
02:27:06.349 --> 02:27:06.359 align:start position:0%
they can get a reasonable accommodation
 
02:27:08.750 --> 02:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
it would be great to put it in law
 
02:27:10.790 --> 02:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
to help them out even more
 
02:27:13.730 --> 02:27:13.740 align:start position:0%
I hope we can do that in
 
02:27:19.969 --> 02:27:19.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:22.309 --> 02:27:22.319 align:start position:0%
