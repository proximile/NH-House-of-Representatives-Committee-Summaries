00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 align:start position:0%
good afternoon everybody welcome back to
 
00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 align:start position:0%
our retirement Commission
 
00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.810 align:start position:0%
all right
um

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 align:start position:0%
we'll try and be efficient so you don't
 
00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 align:start position:0%
lose too much of this beautiful day and
 
00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 align:start position:0%
I'm glad to see that you're engaged in
 
00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 align:start position:0%
the other important part of this
 
00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:40.979 align:start position:0%
commission that is talking to each other
 
00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 align:start position:0%
uh but first we have the minutes of the
 
00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 align:start position:0%
two previous meetings which have been
 
00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 align:start position:0%
posted on our website
 
00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to have someone who has
 
00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 align:start position:0%
small group yes all right well someone
 
00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 align:start position:0%
who who would be willing to approve the
 
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.370 align:start position:0%
who who would be willing to approve the
matter

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 align:start position:0%
okay moved by Senator gray seconded by
 
00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:11.759 align:start position:0%
Mr Martinez
 
00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
any discussion Corrections
 
00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 align:start position:0%
all right those in favor
 
00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.220 align:start position:0%
aye aye those opposed
 
00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much the next
 
00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
item we have is a
 
00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 align:start position:0%
chart that from the retirement system
 
00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:34.139 align:start position:0%
that is a summary of a number of
 
00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 align:start position:0%
cost estimates that were prepared
 
00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:38.820 align:start position:0%
earlier this year for bills under
 
00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
Mr Carlin if you would start to
 
00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340 align:start position:0%
introduce us to it and this is for our
 
00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 align:start position:0%
information we don't
 
00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 align:start position:0%
to understand some of the intricacies of
 
00:05:57.529 --> 00:05:57.539 align:start position:0%
the way the retirement system works and
 
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
the way the costs vary
 
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:03.780 align:start position:0%
and so please do ask questions
 
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair for the record
 
00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:07.199 align:start position:0%
Marty Carlin with the New Hampshire
 
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:09.180 align:start position:0%
retirement system there are some extra
 
00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:11.100 align:start position:0%
copies on the table or maybe everybody's
 
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:12.660 align:start position:0%
grabbed one already
 
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:14.940 align:start position:0%
um but we did we did provide an
 
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
electronic copy so that will probably
 
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:18.780 align:start position:0%
show up on the website
 
00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:22.139 align:start position:0%
um what what this is is a a summary of
 
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:26.220 align:start position:0%
various bills and amendments that move
 
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
forward through the legislature
 
00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:31.199 align:start position:0%
um you know this spring primarily
 
00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:32.639 align:start position:0%
related to group two but there's some
 
00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
group one benefit changes as well so
 
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
this is it this is a very
 
00:06:40.309 --> 00:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
intense distillation of
 
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:42.600 align:start position:0%
some complicated legislation it's sort
 
00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:44.940 align:start position:0%
of the the summary is is in shorthand so
 
00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:46.740 align:start position:0%
there are some details missed but I've
 
00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:48.360 align:start position:0%
got the the bill and the amendment
 
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:51.660 align:start position:0%
numbers if somebody wanted to dig deeper
 
00:06:54.969 --> 00:06:54.979 align:start position:0%
um the second column is
 
00:06:58.309 --> 00:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
u-a-l-u-a-a-l-m-pac that's the amount of
 
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
these changes that the actuary estimates
 
00:07:03.409 --> 00:07:03.419 align:start position:0%
estimates would add to the unfunded
 
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:06.120 align:start position:0%
liability in terms of previously accrued
 
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
benefits that weren't funded you know
 
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
because they were being changed
 
00:07:12.469 --> 00:07:12.479 align:start position:0%
um you know at this point
 
00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:15.240 align:start position:0%
um the third column A projected employer
 
00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:17.100 align:start position:0%
rate increase for police fire as a
 
00:07:19.969 --> 00:07:19.979 align:start position:0%
percentage of covered payroll so
 
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
this is the
 
00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:24.300 align:start position:0%
um you know what you know based uh what
 
00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:25.919 align:start position:0%
the percentage increase would be for
 
00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:27.660 align:start position:0%
future employer contribution rates
 
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
beginning in fiscal 26 which is the next
 
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:32.280 align:start position:0%
rate setting valuation if any of this
 
00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:33.960 align:start position:0%
was passed
 
00:07:37.249 --> 00:07:37.259 align:start position:0%
um you know this spring and then the
 
00:07:40.249 --> 00:07:40.259 align:start position:0%
that those amounts in dollars you know
 
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
based on the current payroll data that
 
00:07:44.689 --> 00:07:44.699 align:start position:0%
we have multiplied by those percentages
 
00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:46.620 align:start position:0%
of pay
 
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
um finally members impacted is
 
00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:51.060 align:start position:0%
um which group
 
00:07:53.689 --> 00:07:53.699 align:start position:0%
um the benefit proposals would affect
 
00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:55.380 align:start position:0%
we're using I'm in for this chart
 
00:07:58.129 --> 00:07:58.139 align:start position:0%
because we have them now I'm using a 630
 
00:08:00.529 --> 00:08:00.539 align:start position:0%
of 22 head counts
 
00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
um the uh 1800 in trb that was um 630 of
 
00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
21 head count so so there has been some
 
00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:09.240 align:start position:0%
uh diminishment in that active
 
00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.850 align:start position:0%
uh diminishment in that active
population

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:10.860 align:start position:0%
population
 
00:08:12.589 --> 00:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
um you know you know in in that prior
 
00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal year a couple of things to sort
 
00:08:19.309 --> 00:08:19.319 align:start position:0%
of uh explain to the committee there are
 
00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
some old hands who I apologize for kind
 
00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:24.360 align:start position:0%
of stepping back but
 
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:25.800 align:start position:0%
um when we talk about employer
 
00:08:27.589 --> 00:08:27.599 align:start position:0%
contribution rates there are two pieces
 
00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:29.400 align:start position:0%
that go into that
 
00:08:32.029 --> 00:08:32.039 align:start position:0%
um for the pension rate and that's the
 
00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:34.919 align:start position:0%
unfunded cost and the normal cost and
 
00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:37.260 align:start position:0%
the unfunded is the
 
00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
um the liability
 
00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:43.140 align:start position:0%
um piece that's that's paying for past
 
00:08:45.889 --> 00:08:45.899 align:start position:0%
benefits earned but not yet fully funded
 
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
and then the normal cost is the actual
 
00:08:50.389 --> 00:08:50.399 align:start position:0%
estimate of what it costs to fund these
 
00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
benefits for these members going forward
 
00:08:54.889 --> 00:08:54.899 align:start position:0%
so you know the normal cost is basically
 
00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
a pre-funding between what the member
 
00:08:58.250 --> 00:08:58.260 align:start position:0%
puts in and what the employer puts in
 
00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:00.360 align:start position:0%
toward the normal cost
 
00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:02.580 align:start position:0%
um if all assumptions are met that's
 
00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:04.860 align:start position:0%
going to fund the benefit for that
 
00:09:06.889 --> 00:09:06.899 align:start position:0%
person you know
 
00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
um when they retire
 
00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:12.060 align:start position:0%
um so there are
 
00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:15.240 align:start position:0%
uh and I think the handout we uh dropped
 
00:09:17.449 --> 00:09:17.459 align:start position:0%
off last week had showed what the normal
 
00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
cost and the unfunded were and the
 
00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:21.420 align:start position:0%
breakdown and most of what employers are
 
00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:23.820 align:start position:0%
paying now is the unfunded piece
 
00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:27.480 align:start position:0%
so the numbers in this chart are
 
00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:29.100 align:start position:0%
um some of some of these proposals had
 
00:09:30.949 --> 00:09:30.959 align:start position:0%
additional funding sources attached to
 
00:09:33.769 --> 00:09:33.779 align:start position:0%
them so we we tease those out so these
 
00:09:35.389 --> 00:09:35.399 align:start position:0%
are the raw unfunded if it was just
 
00:09:36.769 --> 00:09:36.779 align:start position:0%
going to be paid for through future
 
00:09:38.329 --> 00:09:38.339 align:start position:0%
employer rates with no additional
 
00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:41.100 align:start position:0%
Appropriations or dedicated funding and
 
00:09:44.269 --> 00:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
these are what the increases are in the
 
00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:46.380 align:start position:0%
um employer rates associated with it
 
00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:49.800 align:start position:0%
just to make it more apples to apples
 
00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:50.449 align:start position:0%
just to make it more apples to apples
um

00:09:50.449 --> 00:09:50.459 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
so that's that's sort of the outline of
 
00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
the the chart and again as the chair
 
00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
said this is an intended you know uh to
 
00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
you know pick an outcome uh but this is
 
00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:02.820 align:start position:0%
just to kind of show the the the breadth
 
00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:05.519 align:start position:0%
and the order of magnitude on what some
 
00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:07.620 align:start position:0%
of the changes proposed in the spring
 
00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:10.260 align:start position:0%
would cost so whatever this commission
 
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
mayor may not settle on recommending
 
00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:15.300 align:start position:0%
you know this may help you without
 
00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
waiting for the Actuarial assessment of
 
00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:19.740 align:start position:0%
the proposals introduced by Senator
 
00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:22.380 align:start position:0%
Bradley last week
 
00:10:24.889 --> 00:10:24.899 align:start position:0%
um this this may give sort of a ballpark
 
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
or just just help you triangulate wrap
 
00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:29.700 align:start position:0%
your head around uh the scope of some of
 
00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
these changes
 
00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:34.260 align:start position:0%
I I can go through each one if you want
 
00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
or I can take questions whatever the the
 
00:10:39.829 --> 00:10:39.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:41.580 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters
 
00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:43.980 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:45.110 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
um

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:47.820 align:start position:0%
could you point on this chart to the
 
00:10:50.389 --> 00:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
ones that seem to be most relevant to
 
00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:52.500 align:start position:0%
what Senator Bradley presented last week
 
00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:53.990 align:start position:0%
what Senator Bradley presented last week
yes

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:10:56.569 --> 00:10:56.579 align:start position:0%
um probably the the
 
00:10:59.449 --> 00:10:59.459 align:start position:0%
closest one and it isn't exactly that
 
00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:01.740 align:start position:0%
close was um at the bottom of the front
 
00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
page first page HB 449 this was a
 
00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:08.420 align:start position:0%
proposal that was retained by housie DNA
 
00:11:12.949 --> 00:11:12.959 align:start position:0%
and it increased the the multiplier for
 
00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:14.940 align:start position:0%
service retirement for all members of
 
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:18.240 align:start position:0%
group two tier B and TRC going forward
 
00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
on their for their first 20 years of
 
00:11:23.269 --> 00:11:23.279 align:start position:0%
group two service so
 
00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
um the Bradley amendments from last week
 
00:11:29.449 --> 00:11:29.459 align:start position:0%
were based on a floor Amendment Senator
 
00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:31.500 align:start position:0%
Susie had put together that we had no
 
00:11:33.769 --> 00:11:33.779 align:start position:0%
time to analyze uh in time for the
 
00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
Senate to vote on hb2 so we didn't look
 
00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:38.220 align:start position:0%
at that's the closest one but we don't
 
00:11:39.769 --> 00:11:39.779 align:start position:0%
have any numbers associated with that
 
00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:41.480 align:start position:0%
one but this is the next closest one
 
00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:45.060 align:start position:0%
this cost again this is all of tier B
 
00:11:47.509 --> 00:11:47.519 align:start position:0%
which is what those bills contemplate at
 
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
a two and a half percent multiplier plus
 
00:11:52.449 --> 00:11:52.459 align:start position:0%
tier C which are the current and future
 
00:11:54.829 --> 00:11:54.839 align:start position:0%
group two members hired on or after
 
00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:56.940 align:start position:0%
seven one of eleven plus future group to
 
00:11:59.509 --> 00:11:59.519 align:start position:0%
hire so that this this is more expensive
 
00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
than either of the Amendments uh Senator
 
00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:04.500 align:start position:0%
Bradley put in and it would also be
 
00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
harder to
 
00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:08.100 align:start position:0%
terminally fund up front because there's
 
00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
it's a in perpetuity there's you know
 
00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:11.700 align:start position:0%
future members who aren't even in the
 
00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:13.740 align:start position:0%
system we'd have to be trying to track
 
00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:16.970 align:start position:0%
system we'd have to be trying to track
please

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:16.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:18.949 --> 00:12:18.959 align:start position:0%
so I guess I'm hearing two things that
 
00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:20.820 align:start position:0%
yes indeed I mean just looking at what's
 
00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:23.519 align:start position:0%
here in that one you pointed to and
 
00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley said
 
00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
um certainly the cost
 
00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:29.100 align:start position:0%
would be lower because of the numbers
 
00:12:31.009 --> 00:12:31.019 align:start position:0%
that he used for the autoplier and the
 
00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
number of people including it but could
 
00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:34.680 align:start position:0%
you expand a little bit more on the
 
00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:41.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
is having trouble hearing you could you
 
00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:45.980 align:start position:0%
bring your microphone closer
 
00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:49.740 align:start position:0%
sure yeah um what I was trying to get at
 
00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:51.720 align:start position:0%
is you know if if the change were only
 
00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:54.060 align:start position:0%
for the trb group two people that's a
 
00:12:56.329 --> 00:12:56.339 align:start position:0%
there's a finite pool of members in that
 
00:12:58.850 --> 00:12:58.860 align:start position:0%
group so you it's easier to Value
 
00:13:00.889 --> 00:13:00.899 align:start position:0%
because you know you you would apply the
 
00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:03.180 align:start position:0%
assumptions applicable to that to that
 
00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:05.820 align:start position:0%
group to come out with a cost but House
 
00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
Bill 449 is introduced made that
 
00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:10.740 align:start position:0%
multiplier two and a half percent for
 
00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
the first 20 years for everyone so
 
00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
somebody hired in 2030 2040 you know in
 
00:13:17.509 --> 00:13:17.519 align:start position:0%
in the farther away you get it's it's
 
00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:19.560 align:start position:0%
harder for an actuary to calculate
 
00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:21.660 align:start position:0%
there's no liabilities associated with
 
00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:23.160 align:start position:0%
those future hires but what the normal
 
00:13:24.769 --> 00:13:24.779 align:start position:0%
cost is going to look like is harder to
 
00:13:24.779 --> 00:13:25.850 align:start position:0%
cost is going to look like is harder to
Peg

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:25.860 align:start position:0%
Peg
 
00:13:28.009 --> 00:13:28.019 align:start position:0%
but if I just McFarlane I mean that's
 
00:13:29.329 --> 00:13:29.339 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to get at is that I mean
 
00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:30.660 align:start position:0%
we're going to talk about this more
 
00:13:32.449 --> 00:13:32.459 align:start position:0%
later obviously but just to kind of have
 
00:13:34.129 --> 00:13:34.139 align:start position:0%
a sense of it
 
00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:35.700 align:start position:0%
um the terminal funding issue which is
 
00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:37.620 align:start position:0%
going to be important for us could you
 
00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:39.060 align:start position:0%
talk a bit more about the complications
 
00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:41.820 align:start position:0%
of that part of it yeah so so terminal
 
00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:45.060 align:start position:0%
funding the way it's used in retirement
 
00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
um is you know the the concept of of
 
00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:50.700 align:start position:0%
paying up front for
 
00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:52.860 align:start position:0%
um you know a change so that there's no
 
00:13:54.949 --> 00:13:54.959 align:start position:0%
rate you know there's no future increase
 
00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
you know future impact on rates or on
 
00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
funding so usually terminal funding when
 
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
I first got here was it was used in
 
00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
mainly in the context of funding colas
 
00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
if you know you know you're giving a one
 
00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:10.620 align:start position:0%
and a half percent call to everyone in
 
00:14:13.009 --> 00:14:13.019 align:start position:0%
2010 you know the actuary knows how many
 
00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:15.240 align:start position:0%
people there are knows on average how
 
00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:16.380 align:start position:0%
long they're going to live and what
 
00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
their benefits are now so they can come
 
00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
up with a number in today's dollars to
 
00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:23.700 align:start position:0%
say you know that Cola costs 40 million
 
00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:25.200 align:start position:0%
dollars or whatever
 
00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:27.300 align:start position:0%
um obviously you know if there are
 
00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
economic disruptions or other things you
 
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
know that it may not truly be terminally
 
00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
funded but basically it's like that's
 
00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
what it costs tomorrow to fund this for
 
00:14:38.509 --> 00:14:38.519 align:start position:0%
everybody give us a check and it's done
 
00:14:40.009 --> 00:14:40.019 align:start position:0%
you know so that that's how terminal
 
00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:43.380 align:start position:0%
funding works so it works best with you
 
00:14:45.769 --> 00:14:45.779 align:start position:0%
know in terms of getting truly accurate
 
00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:49.260 align:start position:0%
estimates when you have a closed pool so
 
00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:51.540 align:start position:0%
if there were changes just for trb and
 
00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:54.300 align:start position:0%
we actually asked GRS in analyzing the
 
00:14:56.509 --> 00:14:56.519 align:start position:0%
proposals from last week to come to
 
00:14:58.250 --> 00:14:58.260 align:start position:0%
include a terminal funding number so
 
00:14:59.810 --> 00:14:59.820 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't even have any rate impact
 
00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:02.100 align:start position:0%
going forward it's like you know here's
 
00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
the ual impact here's the rate impact if
 
00:15:06.889 --> 00:15:06.899 align:start position:0%
you don't you know with or without
 
00:15:08.629 --> 00:15:08.639 align:start position:0%
funding the unfunded piece up front
 
00:15:10.189 --> 00:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
here's a terminal funding number for
 
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
that so we usually don't do that with
 
00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
legislative analysis because when you
 
00:15:17.389 --> 00:15:17.399 align:start position:0%
make open-ended changes for you know
 
00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:20.940 align:start position:0%
current and future hires the the
 
00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:23.220 align:start position:0%
degree of certainty gets gets harder you
 
00:15:25.189 --> 00:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
know what I mean uh to to do so that's
 
00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:27.060 align:start position:0%
that's terminal funding I hope that
 
00:15:29.689 --> 00:15:29.699 align:start position:0%
answered the question the the other
 
00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:32.220 align:start position:0%
point is that
 
00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:34.740 align:start position:0%
if those changes are considered as an
 
00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
improved pension for the people that are
 
00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:41.220 align:start position:0%
currently in working and still to be
 
00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:44.220 align:start position:0%
hired that increases the normal cost of
 
00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
the pension and either the employer or
 
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
the employee will have to pay for it to
 
00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
because it's an increased benefit you uh
 
00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:54.360 align:start position:0%
you're correct Madam chair so yeah if
 
00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
there's a benefit increase you know that
 
00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:57.650 align:start position:0%
there's a benefit increase you know that
will

00:15:57.650 --> 00:15:57.660 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:00.540 align:start position:0%
you know increase the normal cost going
 
00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:01.670 align:start position:0%
you know increase the normal cost going
forward

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:03.180 align:start position:0%
um for people you know and then the
 
00:16:05.329 --> 00:16:05.339 align:start position:0%
member funds all all of the member
 
00:16:07.189 --> 00:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
contributions go towards the normal cost
 
00:16:08.449 --> 00:16:08.459 align:start position:0%
and I think
 
00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:10.500 align:start position:0%
you know two percent two and a half
 
00:16:12.889 --> 00:16:12.899 align:start position:0%
percent in group one and maybe seven
 
00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
percent or so in group two employer
 
00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
contributions fund that normal cost and
 
00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:20.220 align:start position:0%
you know we we'll say sometimes you know
 
00:16:22.069 --> 00:16:22.079 align:start position:0%
in the hypothetical perfect world we're
 
00:16:25.009 --> 00:16:25.019 align:start position:0%
100 funded the the rates aren't onerous
 
00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:27.240 align:start position:0%
for the member or the retiree to get a
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
decent benefit but we're not in that
 
00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
hypothetical world we have a liability
 
00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:33.480 align:start position:0%
that we're working towards
 
00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:36.360 align:start position:0%
um you know uh
 
00:16:38.629 --> 00:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
relieving uh you know over the next 20
 
00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
plus years or so so
 
00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:42.540 align:start position:0%
um you know so that that's that's how
 
00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:45.240 align:start position:0%
that works with a with a closed group if
 
00:16:47.389 --> 00:16:47.399 align:start position:0%
for the uh Bradley amendments from last
 
00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:49.980 align:start position:0%
week if if since it is a finite nobody
 
00:16:52.069 --> 00:16:52.079 align:start position:0%
nobody can be added to trb in the future
 
00:16:53.269 --> 00:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
because they would have had to have
 
00:16:56.689 --> 00:16:56.699 align:start position:0%
started between you know O2 and 2011.
 
00:16:59.389 --> 00:16:59.399 align:start position:0%
um you know it you they they will try to
 
00:17:01.069 --> 00:17:01.079 align:start position:0%
estimate a terminal funding for that
 
00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:03.240 align:start position:0%
normal cost because they know you know
 
00:17:04.669 --> 00:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
there's a beginning and an end point to
 
00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:10.370 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:10.380 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:17:12.850 --> 00:17:12.860 align:start position:0%
does anyone else have any questions or
 
00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:16.020 align:start position:0%
Mr real
 
00:17:17.689 --> 00:17:17.699 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Carlin
 
00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:19.140 align:start position:0%
um so what
 
00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
would it be safe to say that because
 
00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
that is a finite group it has a has a
 
00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:27.480 align:start position:0%
beginning and an end that this uh
 
00:17:30.289 --> 00:17:30.299 align:start position:0%
projected employer rate increase for any
 
00:17:31.549 --> 00:17:31.559 align:start position:0%
of those
 
00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
any of the listed bills would eventually
 
00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:37.620 align:start position:0%
decline or not be there
 
00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
yes yes it's it's not a it wouldn't drop
 
00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
off immediately the way that the normal
 
00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:44.220 align:start position:0%
cost is constructed it's an aggregate of
 
00:17:47.029 --> 00:17:47.039 align:start position:0%
all of the member tiers you know the the
 
00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
tra the older members in both group one
 
00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
and group two generally would have a
 
00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:53.100 align:start position:0%
higher normal cost
 
00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
um actually the newer hires in group one
 
00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
are slightly higher than the middle tier
 
00:17:58.310 --> 00:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
um just because of the demographics of
 
00:17:59.810 --> 00:17:59.820 align:start position:0%
the people who've been hired in the last
 
00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
10 years you know but over time because
 
00:18:06.049 --> 00:18:06.059 align:start position:0%
the benefits are are lower for the
 
00:18:07.789 --> 00:18:07.799 align:start position:0%
people hired after seven one of eleven
 
00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:09.780 align:start position:0%
as they become
 
00:18:12.049 --> 00:18:12.059 align:start position:0%
they're already the the primary amount
 
00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:13.500 align:start position:0%
of people who are active now but when
 
00:18:15.049 --> 00:18:15.059 align:start position:0%
they become the dominant and the full
 
00:18:16.549 --> 00:18:16.559 align:start position:0%
amount of people active the normal cost
 
00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:19.320 align:start position:0%
is going to keep going down to to fund
 
00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:27.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:32.580 align:start position:0%
Senator gray oh yes Senator thank you
 
00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
thank you uh since my name is on the top
 
00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
one on the system sheet
 
00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
I at least want to talk to that one
 
00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:44.700 align:start position:0%
it was a concept that that was discussed
 
00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
in the Republican caucus and that's why
 
00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:50.820 align:start position:0%
we asked for the estimates that you see
 
00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:52.430 align:start position:0%
we asked for the estimates that you see
there

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:52.440 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
um I went through the transition for the
 
00:18:57.950 --> 00:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
federal government in the 1980s and
 
00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
early 90s where they went from the Civil
 
00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
Service retirement system to the federal
 
00:19:05.289 --> 00:19:05.299 align:start position:0%
employees retirement system
 
00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:08.280 align:start position:0%
civil service retirement system was much
 
00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
like the system we have here where there
 
00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:14.820 align:start position:0%
was a defined contribution and the
 
00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:16.190 align:start position:0%
was a defined contribution and the
benefits

00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:16.200 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:17.640 align:start position:0%
or whatever
 
00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:20.820 align:start position:0%
they went to a three-tier system
 
00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:24.780 align:start position:0%
and part of that system was a smaller
 
00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:26.110 align:start position:0%
and part of that system was a smaller
retirement

00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:26.120 align:start position:0%
retirement
 
00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:31.160 align:start position:0%
social security and then a contribution
 
00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
to the Thrift Savings Program
 
00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:38.700 align:start position:0%
403 402 whichever you know term that you
 
00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:41.780 align:start position:0%
you want to use for your your retirement
 
00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
benefits up to five percent of your
 
00:19:46.909 --> 00:19:46.919 align:start position:0%
salary and
 
00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
so that this number that you see there
 
00:19:55.669 --> 00:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
uh the 15.7 million is not a retroactive
 
00:19:59.390 --> 00:19:59.400 align:start position:0%
number it would be something that would
 
00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
affect all the employees group uh two
 
00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:07.020 align:start position:0%
employees you know new ones old ones uh
 
00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:09.660 align:start position:0%
whatever based on the percentages that
 
00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:10.940 align:start position:0%
you see there
 
00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
recognizes that that percentage does not
 
00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:17.220 align:start position:0%
have to be the same uh throughout the
 
00:20:19.909 --> 00:20:19.919 align:start position:0%
whole active career of the individual
 
00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:23.640 align:start position:0%
that it can change one of the reasons
 
00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:24.890 align:start position:0%
that it can change one of the reasons
why

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:24.900 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:20:28.549 --> 00:20:28.559 align:start position:0%
we looked at this was from the various
 
00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
officers and stuff that came into my
 
00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
office and said that we have a retention
 
00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:35.940 align:start position:0%
problem that people now are looking at
 
00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
going to Massachusetts or other places
 
00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:42.780 align:start position:0%
to get to two and a half percent uh
 
00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
after they get to their 20 years
 
00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:45.850 align:start position:0%
after they get to their 20 years
investing

00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:45.860 align:start position:0%
investing
 
00:20:49.909 --> 00:20:49.919 align:start position:0%
and certainly that can be solved by
 
00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
changing the percentage and if that is
 
00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:57.240 align:start position:0%
the reason that we're doing it is to to
 
00:20:59.510 --> 00:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
do longevity and to keep the people
 
00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
there then you can't just do the people
 
00:21:06.289 --> 00:21:06.299 align:start position:0%
who are in that middle tier you've got
 
00:21:09.049 --> 00:21:09.059 align:start position:0%
to continue that throughout if that's
 
00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:11.880 align:start position:0%
what your intent is is to retain
 
00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:16.620 align:start position:0%
employees past that 20-year mark uh now
 
00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
that doesn't preclude uh the other thing
 
00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:22.500 align:start position:0%
that I talked briefly about last time
 
00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:24.900 align:start position:0%
and that is some kind of a matching
 
00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
program uh which would be outside of the
 
00:21:30.169 --> 00:21:30.179 align:start position:0%
retirement system uh and could be
 
00:21:33.409 --> 00:21:33.419 align:start position:0%
negotiated with the various contracts
 
00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
for uh the individuals so that if a
 
00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:40.559 align:start position:0%
group comes in and says Okay I want a
 
00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
five percent raise uh there may be a
 
00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:45.480 align:start position:0%
negotiation that uh one percent or two
 
00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
percent goes into match getting it up to
 
00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:51.200 align:start position:0%
maybe a five percent match or something
 
00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:54.900 align:start position:0%
uh you know maximum but that would be
 
00:21:57.470 --> 00:21:57.480 align:start position:0%
paid with current dollars uh would not
 
00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
have an impact on the the unfunded
 
00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:02.600 align:start position:0%
accrued liability
 
00:22:07.669 --> 00:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
it would be a impact on the local is
 
00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
that if they negotiate the contract and
 
00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
they negotiate that they will do this
 
00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
match uh it will not have any impact on
 
00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:17.700 align:start position:0%
the state and it won't be us
 
00:22:20.029 --> 00:22:20.039 align:start position:0%
transferring anything cost to them
 
00:22:21.529 --> 00:22:21.539 align:start position:0%
because they will have been The
 
00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:24.380 align:start position:0%
Negotiator of that contract
 
00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:28.380 align:start position:0%
and that on the state level certainly as
 
00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:32.280 align:start position:0%
contracts get negotiated and that Clause
 
00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:35.220 align:start position:0%
were in effect then the state would pick
 
00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:40.220 align:start position:0%
those up as a regular cost of employment
 
00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:42.900 align:start position:0%
and it would be outside the retirement
 
00:22:46.669 --> 00:22:46.679 align:start position:0%
system so it it does a couple of things
 
00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
you know it takes care of the people who
 
00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:53.780 align:start position:0%
say I'm leaving because I'm not getting
 
00:22:57.409 --> 00:22:57.419 align:start position:0%
the percentage I want now the percentage
 
00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:01.140 align:start position:0%
that I put in there was 0.25 percent at
 
00:23:05.810 --> 00:23:05.820 align:start position:0%
20 years and 0.25 more at 30 years those
 
00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:06.980 align:start position:0%
were just
 
00:23:10.549 --> 00:23:10.559 align:start position:0%
you know Place Keepers to start with
 
00:23:10.559 --> 00:23:11.330 align:start position:0%
you know Place Keepers to start with
um

00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:11.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:14.600 align:start position:0%
but you can see that that cost
 
00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
is much reduced from some of the others
 
00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:22.280 align:start position:0%
that you you see that are retroactive
 
00:23:26.029 --> 00:23:26.039 align:start position:0%
and for this to be affordable and
 
00:23:26.039 --> 00:23:27.070 align:start position:0%
and for this to be affordable and
sustainable

00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:27.080 align:start position:0%
sustainable
 
00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
we need to look at that cost and make
 
00:23:32.649 --> 00:23:32.659 align:start position:0%
sure that it is something that we can do
 
00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
right now I've said it last time I'll
 
00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:39.240 align:start position:0%
say it again uh I just don't see how
 
00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:41.340 align:start position:0%
you've you fund
 
00:23:44.029 --> 00:23:44.039 align:start position:0%
a cola that is Meaningful
 
00:23:44.039 --> 00:23:45.789 align:start position:0%
a cola that is Meaningful
okay

00:23:45.789 --> 00:23:45.799 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
you know I'll sit here and listen to all
 
00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:51.240 align:start position:0%
of you speak whoever wants to speak on
 
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
it but when you actually look at that
 
00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:56.460 align:start position:0%
and the impact uh not in the first year
 
00:23:59.149 --> 00:23:59.159 align:start position:0%
not in the fifth year in the tenth year
 
00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:02.280 align:start position:0%
in the 20th year and whatever uh going
 
00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
out because people are retiring and
 
00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
living for many many many years
 
00:24:10.789 --> 00:24:10.799 align:start position:0%
I mean who would think that I you know
 
00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
would have been retired for 14 years
 
00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:13.730 align:start position:0%
would have been retired for 14 years
already

00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:13.740 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
um but again you know some of those
 
00:24:19.789 --> 00:24:19.799 align:start position:0%
things you know
 
00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:22.980 align:start position:0%
if if the reason that we're doing this
 
00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
is to retain are are qualified and you
 
00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
know good individuals uh I don't see how
 
00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:33.720 align:start position:0%
you just do that middle tier I don't you
 
00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:35.460 align:start position:0%
know because you're going to run into
 
00:24:39.529 --> 00:24:39.539 align:start position:0%
that same situation when you get further
 
00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:43.320 align:start position:0%
out so again I just wanted to tell you
 
00:24:46.549 --> 00:24:46.559 align:start position:0%
why this was done uh the reasons it was
 
00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:50.940 align:start position:0%
done and the the thinking behind what we
 
00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:52.200 align:start position:0%
were trying to do
 
00:24:54.409 --> 00:24:54.419 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:56.820 align:start position:0%
Mr real
 
00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
I was wondering if Mr Carlin might be
 
00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:05.000 align:start position:0%
able to provide a little commentary on
 
00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh the historical perspective of the
 
00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
group one versus group two
 
00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:11.630 align:start position:0%
group one versus group two
classifications

00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
classifications
 
00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:14.280 align:start position:0%
um and I asked because it's it's my
 
00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:15.780 align:start position:0%
understanding that those classifications
 
00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:19.020 align:start position:0%
are in place due to the Hazardous nature
 
00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
of group two jobs and whether or not
 
00:25:25.789 --> 00:25:25.799 align:start position:0%
um as a short follow-up if you're seeing
 
00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:28.200 align:start position:0%
many firefighters police officers and
 
00:25:30.529 --> 00:25:30.539 align:start position:0%
Correctional Personnel working careers
 
00:25:33.169 --> 00:25:33.179 align:start position:0%
uh in excess of 30 years if that's
 
00:25:34.789 --> 00:25:34.799 align:start position:0%
common practice
 
00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh one of the uh one of the
 
00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:40.140 align:start position:0%
handouts that
 
00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
um was provided in advance of the
 
00:25:43.549 --> 00:25:43.559 align:start position:0%
commission meeting I don't have it right
 
00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:45.900 align:start position:0%
in front of me right now just so show
 
00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:48.360 align:start position:0%
the average years of service
 
00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:50.340 align:start position:0%
um for all four member groups when they
 
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
for people who go out on service
 
00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:53.700 align:start position:0%
retirement which is the traditional path
 
00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
to retirement you know not not a
 
00:25:57.649 --> 00:25:57.659 align:start position:0%
disability uh retirement or vested
 
00:26:00.649 --> 00:26:00.659 align:start position:0%
deferred and I if I recall correctly I
 
00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
think the you know the average over the
 
00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:07.320 align:start position:0%
last decade of police was 22 to 24 25
 
00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:10.380 align:start position:0%
years and the fire was slightly higher
 
00:26:12.529 --> 00:26:12.539 align:start position:0%
firefighters tend to work on average a
 
00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
couple more years we you know we do have
 
00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:17.100 align:start position:0%
I can I can get that from last year's
 
00:26:19.909 --> 00:26:19.919 align:start position:0%
annual report the number of retirees in
 
00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
each group who retired with more than 30
 
00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
years of service I mean they're not
 
00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:26.220 align:start position:0%
they're not
 
00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:29.220 align:start position:0%
I don't then there are those people do
 
00:26:31.549 --> 00:26:31.559 align:start position:0%
exist they're not in the majority
 
00:26:33.409 --> 00:26:33.419 align:start position:0%
um but most people tend to make it a
 
00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:37.620 align:start position:0%
career when when nhrs was created in uh
 
00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
in 67 it was a consolidation of four
 
00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
separate retirement plans for state
 
00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:44.279 align:start position:0%
employees that had the option for some
 
00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:46.980 align:start position:0%
towns to join police fire and teachers
 
00:26:48.529 --> 00:26:48.539 align:start position:0%
so they all had their own plan
 
00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
Provisions when they were drawn up they
 
00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:53.640 align:start position:0%
all all of these plans were created
 
00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the vicinity of you know
 
00:26:59.810 --> 00:26:59.820 align:start position:0%
1938 to 42 you know given a ballpark
 
00:27:01.549 --> 00:27:01.559 align:start position:0%
major Loomis is behind me he can correct
 
00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
me if I'm way off on that
 
00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
um but um you know so so they had
 
00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
different benefit Provisions uh they
 
00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:11.400 align:start position:0%
were they were put into nhrs as one plan
 
00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
with one Board of Trustees and one trust
 
00:27:15.289 --> 00:27:15.299 align:start position:0%
fund and you know there always were
 
00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
differences between the group one and
 
00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
group two benefits
 
00:27:21.529 --> 00:27:21.539 align:start position:0%
um you know I I you know and it there
 
00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:23.700 align:start position:0%
are probably two main reasons why is a
 
00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
you know sort of the hazard the physical
 
00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:28.500 align:start position:0%
toll and the hazard of the job in group
 
00:27:30.169 --> 00:27:30.179 align:start position:0%
two and also the fact that group two
 
00:27:32.029 --> 00:27:32.039 align:start position:0%
isn't in Social Security so you're not
 
00:27:33.529 --> 00:27:33.539 align:start position:0%
accruing an additional retirement
 
00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:35.460 align:start position:0%
benefit you know for your group two
 
00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:36.370 align:start position:0%
benefit you know for your group two
service

00:27:36.370 --> 00:27:36.380 align:start position:0%
service
 
00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:38.700 align:start position:0%
historically I think that those are some
 
00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:40.140 align:start position:0%
of the reasons of the you know the
 
00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
difference in some of the formulas and
 
00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:44.820 align:start position:0%
the retirement age eligibility issues
 
00:27:48.769 --> 00:27:48.779 align:start position:0%
yes and from other bills that we've seen
 
00:27:51.169 --> 00:27:51.179 align:start position:0%
over the last few years
 
00:27:54.409 --> 00:27:54.419 align:start position:0%
the the federal government is not
 
00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
letting anybody out that isn't already
 
00:27:59.289 --> 00:27:59.299 align:start position:0%
exempt from Social Security to become so
 
00:28:02.570 --> 00:28:02.580 align:start position:0%
so the teachers are going to keep paying
 
00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:04.620 align:start position:0%
into Social Security
 
00:28:07.789 --> 00:28:07.799 align:start position:0%
and the state employees are and if
 
00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
you're smart the firemen and and police
 
00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:12.230 align:start position:0%
you're smart the firemen and and police
won't

00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
won't
 
00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
yeah Social Security was was it opt-in
 
00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
for public employees uh it was uh I
 
00:28:19.549 --> 00:28:19.559 align:start position:0%
think 1950 is when that enabling
 
00:28:21.529 --> 00:28:21.539 align:start position:0%
legislation was passed by Congress so
 
00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:23.940 align:start position:0%
States had the choice to opt in for
 
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
different Members New Hampshire for
 
00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:28.500 align:start position:0%
whatever reason in the 50s chose not to
 
00:28:30.529 --> 00:28:30.539 align:start position:0%
include Public Safety I think teachers
 
00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:33.240 align:start position:0%
were added in 57 and employees right in
 
00:28:36.289 --> 00:28:36.299 align:start position:0%
50 when it when it passed
 
00:28:36.299 --> 00:28:37.970 align:start position:0%
50 when it when it passed
okay

00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:37.980 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
Mr real
 
00:28:42.769 --> 00:28:42.779 align:start position:0%
Mr Carlin do you know uh once the
 
00:28:45.049 --> 00:28:45.059 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability is paid off which
 
00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
it's due to in 2039 if I'm not mistaken
 
00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh what the actual costs to fund the
 
00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:53.100 align:start position:0%
benefit would be
 
00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
um if if um the the rate and in the in
 
00:28:59.029 --> 00:28:59.039 align:start position:0%
the tail end of that side by side that
 
00:29:01.789 --> 00:29:01.799 align:start position:0%
we dropped off last week it shows the
 
00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:04.260 align:start position:0%
normal costs and unfunded liability so
 
00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
basically what if there was no unfunded
 
00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:08.100 align:start position:0%
liability and it was only the normal
 
00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
cost then what what's left of a medical
 
00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:11.880 align:start position:0%
subsidy amount at that point you would
 
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
just add those two numbers together and
 
00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
just take the liability out of the
 
00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
bottom line on the employer rates
 
00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
um most of the liability is statutorily
 
00:29:25.149 --> 00:29:25.159 align:start position:0%
required to be paid off by 2039
 
00:29:28.210 --> 00:29:28.220 align:start position:0%
literally five billion of the current
 
00:29:32.029 --> 00:29:32.039 align:start position:0%
5.69 billion there that would the uh
 
00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
after the decennial commission met in 17
 
00:29:37.789 --> 00:29:37.799 align:start position:0%
the legislature adopted a proposal the
 
00:29:39.529 --> 00:29:39.539 align:start position:0%
commissioned recommended called layered
 
00:29:40.269 --> 00:29:40.279 align:start position:0%
air and
 
00:29:43.370 --> 00:29:43.380 align:start position:0%
so that's future gains and losses since
 
00:29:46.669 --> 00:29:46.679 align:start position:0%
July 1 of 17 are paid off in 20-year
 
00:29:50.149 --> 00:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
layers going forward so that creates
 
00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:52.200 align:start position:0%
stability in the future like with with
 
00:29:53.810 --> 00:29:53.820 align:start position:0%
layered amortization it would be very
 
00:29:56.090 --> 00:29:56.100 align:start position:0%
hard if not impossible to get into the
 
00:29:57.710 --> 00:29:57.720 align:start position:0%
whole New Hampshire gut in to win the
 
00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
90s and early 2000s so the rates should
 
00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:03.480 align:start position:0%
be stable for you know the foreseeable
 
00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:05.580 align:start position:0%
future you know with with some
 
00:30:07.789 --> 00:30:07.799 align:start position:0%
variations you know based on you know
 
00:30:09.769 --> 00:30:09.779 align:start position:0%
economic Trends and things like that so
 
00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:11.700 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a much less expensive
 
00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:14.820 align:start position:0%
plan beginning you know in the 2040 2041
 
00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:17.580 align:start position:0%
employer rates there still will be some
 
00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:19.740 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability in those layers that
 
00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:21.240 align:start position:0%
employers will be paying but it's not
 
00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
nearly what they're paying now which is
 
00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
75 to 85 percent of the total
 
00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:28.549 align:start position:0%
75 to 85 percent of the total
contribution

00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559 align:start position:0%
contribution
 
00:30:30.049 --> 00:30:30.059 align:start position:0%
um I just want to mention one other
 
00:30:32.269 --> 00:30:32.279 align:start position:0%
thing about that and I'm losing losing
 
00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:34.380 align:start position:0%
the thread unfortunately
 
00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:35.510 align:start position:0%
the thread unfortunately
um

00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:37.980 align:start position:0%
one thing I'd like to mention is that I
 
00:30:39.769 --> 00:30:39.779 align:start position:0%
believe there is a statutory provision
 
00:30:42.649 --> 00:30:42.659 align:start position:0%
that if the employer rate drops below
 
00:30:45.769 --> 00:30:45.779 align:start position:0%
the employee rate the employee rate is
 
00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:47.460 align:start position:0%
adjusted down so that they're equal
 
00:30:49.029 --> 00:30:49.039 align:start position:0%
that's what I was trying to remember
 
00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
yeah because right now the employees are
 
00:30:55.370 --> 00:30:55.380 align:start position:0%
paying the bulk of their re of their
 
00:30:57.409 --> 00:30:57.419 align:start position:0%
retirement efforts and the towns are
 
00:30:58.730 --> 00:30:58.740 align:start position:0%
paying off
 
00:31:01.850 --> 00:31:01.860 align:start position:0%
the underfunding they imposed for 20
 
00:31:04.669 --> 00:31:04.679 align:start position:0%
years yeah so currently the group one
 
00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
rate is seven percent of pay for
 
00:31:08.049 --> 00:31:08.059 align:start position:0%
employees and teachers group two it's
 
00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:11.880 align:start position:0%
11.55 for police and 11.8 percent for
 
00:31:14.389 --> 00:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
fire so if employer rates ever get in
 
00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:16.740 align:start position:0%
each of the groups get below that number
 
00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:19.320 align:start position:0%
the cost will go down for the you know
 
00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:22.440 align:start position:0%
purport you know together in lockstep
 
00:31:24.409 --> 00:31:24.419 align:start position:0%
for the member class
 
00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:28.500 align:start position:0%
oops okay Senator gray uh should be
 
00:31:30.769 --> 00:31:30.779 align:start position:0%
noted I believe in the percentages that
 
00:31:32.930 --> 00:31:32.940 align:start position:0%
you gave for group one it does not
 
00:31:34.789 --> 00:31:34.799 align:start position:0%
include their contribution towards
 
00:31:37.549 --> 00:31:37.559 align:start position:0%
Social Security so yeah we we don't it
 
00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:40.200 align:start position:0%
would be yeah they're actually paying 14
 
00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:43.380 align:start position:0%
whatever uh compared to the group two
 
00:31:48.529 --> 00:31:48.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:50.460 align:start position:0%
I haven't looked at my Pace though in a
 
00:31:52.789 --> 00:31:52.799 align:start position:0%
while but I think it's 6.25 that the
 
00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:54.360 align:start position:0%
employer and the employee pay into
 
00:31:56.450 --> 00:31:56.460 align:start position:0%
Social Security
 
00:31:58.250 --> 00:31:58.260 align:start position:0%
and then there's the Medicaid as well
 
00:32:00.409 --> 00:32:00.419 align:start position:0%
and I think I think both groups in New
 
00:32:02.269 --> 00:32:02.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire do contribute towards Medicare
 
00:32:07.610 --> 00:32:07.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
uh one one thing I I thought to mention
 
00:32:12.169 --> 00:32:12.179 align:start position:0%
I wanted to mention earlier is when
 
00:32:13.669 --> 00:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
you're looking at this chart or even
 
00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
some of the proposals that that may or
 
00:32:18.889 --> 00:32:18.899 align:start position:0%
may not be sent out to the actuary be
 
00:32:20.810 --> 00:32:20.820 align:start position:0%
careful you can't really sort of rack
 
00:32:23.330 --> 00:32:23.340 align:start position:0%
and stack different proposals you know
 
00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:25.620 align:start position:0%
oh if we take out this one piece you
 
00:32:27.529 --> 00:32:27.539 align:start position:0%
know it's going to be cost this because
 
00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:29.100 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of interplay between
 
00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:31.380 align:start position:0%
average final compensation earnable
 
00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:33.720 align:start position:0%
compensation multipliers you know it's
 
00:32:36.409 --> 00:32:36.419 align:start position:0%
it's they're very hard to isolate on
 
00:32:37.549 --> 00:32:37.559 align:start position:0%
their own because they're going to have
 
00:32:40.549 --> 00:32:40.559 align:start position:0%
a cost effect on on things you know
 
00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:43.500 align:start position:0%
outside of their immediate area so it is
 
00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
a little more amorphous when you're
 
00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
looking at costs would it be uh fair to
 
00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:50.700 align:start position:0%
say that the difference between House
 
00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
Bill 436 and and House Bill 2 which is
 
00:32:57.529 --> 00:32:57.539 align:start position:0%
simply the inflation escalator implies
 
00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:00.360 align:start position:0%
the inflation escalator was like 63
 
00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:04.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
which is a lot more than we thought it
 
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
was when we added it in yeah and I I
 
00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:10.500 align:start position:0%
think I think the slight difference too
 
00:33:12.009 --> 00:33:12.019 align:start position:0%
was that the
 
00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
hb2 maybe it did but it like it also it
 
00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
was the current law is 85 of your
 
00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
average final compensation or 120k
 
00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:23.880 align:start position:0%
whichever is lower and I didn't go into
 
00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:26.700 align:start position:0%
100 fatigue so that had that added into
 
00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:28.740 align:start position:0%
the 30 million but I couldn't tell you
 
00:33:30.529 --> 00:33:30.539 align:start position:0%
how much but there was another another
 
00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
you know sometimes sometimes things that
 
00:33:37.789 --> 00:33:37.799 align:start position:0%
seem slight in normal discourse end up
 
00:33:39.049 --> 00:33:39.059 align:start position:0%
being expensive you know when the
 
00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:40.440 align:start position:0%
actuary gets their hands on them and
 
00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:42.360 align:start position:0%
project it out as a monthly benefit
 
00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:43.620 align:start position:0%
increase for somebody who's going to
 
00:33:45.889 --> 00:33:45.899 align:start position:0%
live 30 or 40 more years hopefully you
 
00:33:48.409 --> 00:33:48.419 align:start position:0%
know that you know
 
00:33:49.970 --> 00:33:49.980 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
00:33:51.409 --> 00:33:51.419 align:start position:0%
it was from senator
 
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
Mr Carl and that uh 120 000 that you
 
00:33:58.490 --> 00:33:58.500 align:start position:0%
mentioned or the the 100 or 85 depending
 
00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
on what group you're in
 
00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:02.820 align:start position:0%
um what understanding that there's no
 
00:34:07.009 --> 00:34:07.019 align:start position:0%
definition for spiking with that uh be
 
00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:10.200 align:start position:0%
considered in your opinion a spiking uh
 
00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:13.800 align:start position:0%
preventer or an anti-spiking provision
 
00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
I I wouldn't or nhrs wouldn't take a
 
00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:19.919 align:start position:0%
position on you know whether you know
 
00:34:21.649 --> 00:34:21.659 align:start position:0%
are not that spiky because there are a
 
00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
lot of definitions but my understanding
 
00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
is sort of the intent behind it when it
 
00:34:27.649 --> 00:34:27.659 align:start position:0%
was originally put in in 2009 and then
 
00:34:31.010 --> 00:34:31.020 align:start position:0%
modified in 11 was related to that you
 
00:34:33.889 --> 00:34:33.899 align:start position:0%
know to that terminology thank you
 
00:34:33.899 --> 00:34:36.230 align:start position:0%
know to that terminology thank you
Senator

00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
Senator
 
00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:40.020 align:start position:0%
um nhma testified that some of the costs
 
00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
that were projected the last time uh
 
00:34:45.829 --> 00:34:45.839 align:start position:0%
would actually be increased because that
 
00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:47.700 align:start position:0%
the projections that you gave did not
 
00:34:50.629 --> 00:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
include the cost that the local
 
00:34:52.909 --> 00:34:52.919 align:start position:0%
governments would
 
00:34:52.919 --> 00:34:53.690 align:start position:0%
governments would
um

00:34:53.690 --> 00:34:53.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:56.629 --> 00:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
have to bear based on those could could
 
00:34:58.609 --> 00:34:58.619 align:start position:0%
you expand on that just a little bit so
 
00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
that the people will understand what
 
00:35:03.349 --> 00:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
they're talking about yeah when when you
 
00:35:05.089 --> 00:35:05.099 align:start position:0%
talk about you know cost of all
 
00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
employers including local government as
 
00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:09.660 align:start position:0%
well as the state when when the employer
 
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
contribution rates increase you know
 
00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's a percent of pay that the
 
00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:16.500 align:start position:0%
employee the the employers are paying on
 
00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:17.690 align:start position:0%
employee the the employers are paying on
so

00:35:17.690 --> 00:35:17.700 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
um you know if you're paying somebody a
 
00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:20.460 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars and the rate was 20
 
00:35:22.490 --> 00:35:22.500 align:start position:0%
percent you know and so you're putting
 
00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:24.540 align:start position:0%
20 to sending twenty dollars to nhrs if
 
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
it went up to 22 percent you'd be paying
 
00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
sending them 22 bucks and you know and
 
00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:31.980 align:start position:0%
so on and so forth so the employer rates
 
00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:34.500 align:start position:0%
the the with layer to amortization
 
00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
changes like this to benefits are both
 
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
both in the the unfunded liability is
 
00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:43.020 align:start position:0%
amortized over in one of those 20-year
 
00:35:45.650 --> 00:35:45.660 align:start position:0%
layers so the rate increase is shown in
 
00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:48.060 align:start position:0%
the chart include both the normal cost
 
00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:50.700 align:start position:0%
and the unfunded piece for the for the
 
00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
um for the
 
00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:53.880 align:start position:0%
um you know for that benefit those
 
00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
benefit changes after 20 years the
 
00:35:58.310 --> 00:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
unfunded piece is going to be
 
00:36:00.109 --> 00:36:00.119 align:start position:0%
um you know paid down so there's only
 
00:36:01.849 --> 00:36:01.859 align:start position:0%
the future normal cost going forward
 
00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:04.020 align:start position:0%
associated with it but
 
00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:06.300 align:start position:0%
um you know and it's you know an actuary
 
00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't take those rate increases and
 
00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
and roll them out 20 years based on
 
00:36:12.050 --> 00:36:12.060 align:start position:0%
today's payroll because there are too
 
00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
many variables to have a degree of
 
00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:16.500 align:start position:0%
Actuarial certainty as a sort of an
 
00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:18.540 align:start position:0%
exercise it's an illustration of what
 
00:36:20.930 --> 00:36:20.940 align:start position:0%
the future cost could be you know but it
 
00:36:22.490 --> 00:36:22.500 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:24.540 align:start position:0%
what the future cost will be it's just
 
00:36:27.589 --> 00:36:27.599 align:start position:0%
one possible outcome I I you know if you
 
00:36:29.210 --> 00:36:29.220 align:start position:0%
if you look at what the rates are now
 
00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:30.660 align:start position:0%
and you're trying to project them out in
 
00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
terms of dollars to Future employers
 
00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:34.980 align:start position:0%
think of it as sort of a cone like you
 
00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
know you're pretty sure what it's going
 
00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:38.280 align:start position:0%
to cost next year and a little less sure
 
00:36:39.770 --> 00:36:39.780 align:start position:0%
the year after that and the farther you
 
00:36:42.290 --> 00:36:42.300 align:start position:0%
will outre get you know the the range of
 
00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
outcomes gets larger with each year
 
00:36:46.490 --> 00:36:46.500 align:start position:0%
because of all the other factors that we
 
00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:50.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:52.440 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:36:55.250 --> 00:36:55.260 align:start position:0%
um but there is
 
00:36:57.849 --> 00:36:57.859 align:start position:0%
um according to nhma a significant
 
00:37:00.410 --> 00:37:00.420 align:start position:0%
amount that they would have to pay in
 
00:37:04.089 --> 00:37:04.099 align:start position:0%
addition to the unfunded liability for
 
00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
the proposal in house bill 2. uh from
 
00:37:11.930 --> 00:37:11.940 align:start position:0%
the house yeah even with that 25 million
 
00:37:14.810 --> 00:37:14.820 align:start position:0%
appropriation over 10 years
 
00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:15.960 align:start position:0%
um you know there was still some
 
00:37:18.589 --> 00:37:18.599 align:start position:0%
liability associated with that um with
 
00:37:20.210 --> 00:37:20.220 align:start position:0%
that proposal plus the future normal
 
00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
cost for those members so
 
00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:24.540 align:start position:0%
um I think I think if I recall what Amy
 
00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:27.420 align:start position:0%
and HMA did is took the rate projections
 
00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
um you know from the fiscal note we
 
00:37:31.790 --> 00:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
provided based on grs's analysis and and
 
00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:35.000 align:start position:0%
rolled them forward 20 years and again I
 
00:37:37.609 --> 00:37:37.619 align:start position:0%
it you can't say it's wrong or it's
 
00:37:39.829 --> 00:37:39.839 align:start position:0%
right I did confirm GRS wouldn't be
 
00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
comfortable telling somebody what it's
 
00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
going to cost in 2038
 
00:37:45.410 --> 00:37:45.420 align:start position:0%
um you know just just because of their
 
00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
standards of practice but it's not you
 
00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
know it's it's a it's a reasonable
 
00:37:51.829 --> 00:37:51.839 align:start position:0%
exercise but it isn't
 
00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
the be all and end all you know but but
 
00:37:55.849 --> 00:37:55.859 align:start position:0%
it's fair to say that you know there
 
00:37:58.010 --> 00:37:58.020 align:start position:0%
would be employers would be paying more
 
00:38:00.109 --> 00:38:00.119 align:start position:0%
every year going forward under that
 
00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
proposal the exact amount you know that
 
00:38:04.730 --> 00:38:04.740 align:start position:0%
is is open to
 
00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
you know interpretation or open to
 
00:38:09.290 --> 00:38:09.300 align:start position:0%
whatever happens
 
00:38:11.930 --> 00:38:11.940 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
Mr real
 
00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
Mr Carlin in those projections that you
 
00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:18.720 align:start position:0%
you're speaking about
 
00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:19.430 align:start position:0%
you're speaking about
um

00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:23.400 align:start position:0%
unless I'm mistaken the overall rates
 
00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
were still scheduled to decline as the
 
00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability was paid down
 
00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:30.950 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability was paid down
um

00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:34.069 --> 00:38:34.079 align:start position:0%
we we ex well I mean the actuary I mean
 
00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:35.940 align:start position:0%
in in the in the perfect world that
 
00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist in a vacuum if all the
 
00:38:39.770 --> 00:38:39.780 align:start position:0%
assumptions were
 
00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:41.880 align:start position:0%
um the same uh were met you know over
 
00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
the next 20 years that unfunded
 
00:38:46.730 --> 00:38:46.740 align:start position:0%
percentage amount of the employer rate
 
00:38:48.829 --> 00:38:48.839 align:start position:0%
should stay flat you will see some
 
00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
decline decline in the normal cost as
 
00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:53.160 align:start position:0%
you would referenced earlier so you know
 
00:38:55.790 --> 00:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
and if investment performance is better
 
00:38:57.890 --> 00:38:57.900 align:start position:0%
plan experiences favorable things like
 
00:38:59.750 --> 00:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
that the unfunded percentage could go
 
00:39:01.370 --> 00:39:01.380 align:start position:0%
down as well over the next 20 it's going
 
00:39:04.430 --> 00:39:04.440 align:start position:0%
to go up or go down but you know we did
 
00:39:06.290 --> 00:39:06.300 align:start position:0%
see a rate decrease
 
00:39:11.569 --> 00:39:11.579 align:start position:0%
um 20 FY 24 25 versus 22-23 part of that
 
00:39:13.490 --> 00:39:13.500 align:start position:0%
was the five years of investment
 
00:39:15.170 --> 00:39:15.180 align:start position:0%
performance is leading into that rate
 
00:39:17.870 --> 00:39:17.880 align:start position:0%
setting valuation you know exceeded our
 
00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
assumed rate of return so if we
 
00:39:22.010 --> 00:39:22.020 align:start position:0%
if we make more money than we expect
 
00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
everybody wins essentially
 
00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:25.800 align:start position:0%
um you know and if we don't you know
 
00:39:27.530 --> 00:39:27.540 align:start position:0%
then then it would affect it so that
 
00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
that's why they went down but it's not
 
00:39:30.650 --> 00:39:30.660 align:start position:0%
like they went from
 
00:39:34.370 --> 00:39:34.380 align:start position:0%
21 for teachers to 19 and a half from
 
00:39:36.050 --> 00:39:36.060 align:start position:0%
ballparking here they're not going to go
 
00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
down a you know 18 and a half 17 and a
 
00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:40.200 align:start position:0%
half I mean they're going to you know go
 
00:39:42.410 --> 00:39:42.420 align:start position:0%
down much in a much smaller Pace from
 
00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
the normal cost but they you know they
 
00:39:46.310 --> 00:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
they're not expected to go up
 
00:39:48.589 --> 00:39:48.599 align:start position:0%
uh should again you know if our
 
00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
assumptions are reasonable and uh they
 
00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
should go down somewhat over time you
 
00:39:56.569 --> 00:39:56.579 align:start position:0%
know maybe 20 38 when the big slug is
 
00:39:58.609 --> 00:39:58.619 align:start position:0%
paid off there should be a noticeable
 
00:40:01.310 --> 00:40:01.320 align:start position:0%
decrease provided the legislature
 
00:40:03.349 --> 00:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't go berserk and start adding in
 
00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
more benefits yeah there's a rate Cliff
 
00:40:08.810 --> 00:40:08.820 align:start position:0%
like 20 39 to 40 that most of that
 
00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
unfunded is gonna go that they're paying
 
00:40:12.109 --> 00:40:12.119 align:start position:0%
now is going to go away they're going to
 
00:40:13.849 --> 00:40:13.859 align:start position:0%
see a huge
 
00:40:16.730 --> 00:40:16.740 align:start position:0%
um drop presumably at that point based
 
00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
on the projections Mr Garland thank you
 
00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:22.680 align:start position:0%
again uh the as the New Hampshire
 
00:40:25.370 --> 00:40:25.380 align:start position:0%
retirement system met its assumptions
 
00:40:28.130 --> 00:40:28.140 align:start position:0%
over the five-year 10-year 25-year
 
00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:31.250 align:start position:0%
over the five-year 10-year 25-year
averages

00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:31.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:33.240 align:start position:0%
um over the
 
00:40:36.050 --> 00:40:36.060 align:start position:0%
you know it I I want I don't want to say
 
00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
yes or no not because I don't know but
 
00:40:40.310 --> 00:40:40.320 align:start position:0%
because the assumptions do change over
 
00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:41.640 align:start position:0%
time we do what what are called
 
00:40:43.849 --> 00:40:43.859 align:start position:0%
experiences study experience studies
 
00:40:45.589 --> 00:40:45.599 align:start position:0%
every four to five years and things like
 
00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
mortality tables
 
00:40:49.490 --> 00:40:49.500 align:start position:0%
um the investment return assumption
 
00:40:52.250 --> 00:40:52.260 align:start position:0%
changes so you know basically our
 
00:40:53.690 --> 00:40:53.700 align:start position:0%
current under our current assumptions
 
00:40:55.970 --> 00:40:55.980 align:start position:0%
it's a six and three quarter
 
00:40:57.829 --> 00:40:57.839 align:start position:0%
um investment return for the year that's
 
00:40:59.690 --> 00:40:59.700 align:start position:0%
probably the biggest factor in all the
 
00:41:01.550 --> 00:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
assumptions is how much how do we do in
 
00:41:03.589 --> 00:41:03.599 align:start position:0%
the markets and we have exceeded that
 
00:41:05.690 --> 00:41:05.700 align:start position:0%
over the three five and ten year periods
 
00:41:08.569 --> 00:41:08.579 align:start position:0%
and I think over the 20 or 25 one of
 
00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
those two as well so you know
 
00:41:14.210 --> 00:41:14.220 align:start position:0%
you know we when we had an eight eight
 
00:41:16.069 --> 00:41:16.079 align:start position:0%
and a half percent investment assumption
 
00:41:18.349 --> 00:41:18.359 align:start position:0%
back in the early 2000s for for a number
 
00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
of reasons you know I'm not sure if we
 
00:41:22.130 --> 00:41:22.140 align:start position:0%
were all performing that you know
 
00:41:24.349 --> 00:41:24.359 align:start position:0%
historically but we're outperforming the
 
00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:30.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:33.770 --> 00:41:33.780 align:start position:0%
Mr Fuller oh thank you I just wanted to
 
00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:34.680 align:start position:0%
go back to actually something that
 
00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:36.660 align:start position:0%
Senator gray had mentioned before about
 
00:41:38.810 --> 00:41:38.820 align:start position:0%
um colas I know it's not really on this
 
00:41:40.069 --> 00:41:40.079 align:start position:0%
um sheet if you will but I was wondering
 
00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:42.660 align:start position:0%
if the retirement sister is has actually
 
00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
costed out what a reestablishment of a
 
00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:46.680 align:start position:0%
cola would be because uh well I agree
 
00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:48.060 align:start position:0%
with them that I'm sure it would be a
 
00:41:49.609 --> 00:41:49.619 align:start position:0%
fair amount of money but I think it
 
00:41:51.109 --> 00:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
would be maybe useful and if you've
 
00:41:52.310 --> 00:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
already done it that'd be useful to have
 
00:41:53.690 --> 00:41:53.700 align:start position:0%
that information sure
 
00:41:56.089 --> 00:41:56.099 align:start position:0%
um it's it's dated information but the
 
00:41:58.790 --> 00:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
decennial commission uh did they they
 
00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
had an appropriation for their work in
 
00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
2017 and they asked the um askgrs to uh
 
00:42:09.410 --> 00:42:09.420 align:start position:0%
cost out a a permanent ongoing caller of
 
00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:11.640 align:start position:0%
I forget the percentage
 
00:42:13.490 --> 00:42:13.500 align:start position:0%
um you know going forward and you know
 
00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:15.900 align:start position:0%
because it's a permanent compounded
 
00:42:18.290 --> 00:42:18.300 align:start position:0%
benefit increase every year I do recall
 
00:42:20.089 --> 00:42:20.099 align:start position:0%
it was in excess of a billion on the
 
00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:21.900 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability I can pull those
 
00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
pages out and send them to to be
 
00:42:26.450 --> 00:42:26.460 align:start position:0%
distributed to the commission that's
 
00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:28.440 align:start position:0%
based on the assumptions we had in 2017
 
00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
so there may be some variation
 
00:42:33.109 --> 00:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
um more recently the only actual
 
00:42:36.349 --> 00:42:36.359 align:start position:0%
permanent Cola that the legislature
 
00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
passed was in 2018 effective in fiscal
 
00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:41.940 align:start position:0%
20. that was a one and a half percent
 
00:42:45.170 --> 00:42:45.180 align:start position:0%
for all members on their retired more
 
00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:47.160 align:start position:0%
than five years on their first fifty
 
00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:49.260 align:start position:0%
thousand of retirement income so so
 
00:42:51.530 --> 00:42:51.540 align:start position:0%
there was some exclusions on that one
 
00:42:55.069 --> 00:42:55.079 align:start position:0%
and that in in for to terminally fund
 
00:42:58.010 --> 00:42:58.020 align:start position:0%
that amount that Cola in in that
 
00:42:59.930 --> 00:42:59.940 align:start position:0%
legislative session the actuary
 
00:43:02.809 --> 00:43:02.819 align:start position:0%
estimated about 70 71 million dollars
 
00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:05.160 align:start position:0%
you know to pay that increase for life
 
00:43:07.490 --> 00:43:07.500 align:start position:0%
to everyone who'd be getting it
 
00:43:09.710 --> 00:43:09.720 align:start position:0%
um that Cola the actually the
 
00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:11.700 align:start position:0%
legislature chose not to terminally fund
 
00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
it they passed that on in employer
 
00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:15.960 align:start position:0%
contribution rate increases I think they
 
00:43:17.329 --> 00:43:17.339 align:start position:0%
were like somewhere in the you know
 
00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
point two zero zero point two percent
 
00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
increase or what it wasn't you know it's
 
00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
all relative but in terms of the
 
00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:26.220 align:start position:0%
percentage increase on the current rates
 
00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:28.260 align:start position:0%
it wasn't a huge percentage increase but
 
00:43:29.809 --> 00:43:29.819 align:start position:0%
it was passed along
 
00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:31.980 align:start position:0%
to the state and local employers so
 
00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:33.540 align:start position:0%
there are different ways to fund that
 
00:43:34.849 --> 00:43:34.859 align:start position:0%
and that was I think pretty sure that
 
00:43:36.109 --> 00:43:36.119 align:start position:0%
was too
 
00:43:38.569 --> 00:43:38.579 align:start position:0%
2018 and then effective
 
00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:41.160 align:start position:0%
seven one of 20.
 
00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:42.780 align:start position:0%
Mr real
 
00:43:46.370 --> 00:43:46.380 align:start position:0%
Mr Carlin are you familiar with uh
 
00:43:48.829 --> 00:43:48.839 align:start position:0%
whether or not there are other New
 
00:43:51.530 --> 00:43:51.540 align:start position:0%
England states that have Cola formulas
 
00:43:53.450 --> 00:43:53.460 align:start position:0%
in place and if not is that information
 
00:43:55.790 --> 00:43:55.800 align:start position:0%
we might be able to get
 
00:43:57.349 --> 00:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
I I
 
00:43:59.870 --> 00:43:59.880 align:start position:0%
think some do I believe Maine does for
 
00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
instance I don't have numbers on that
 
00:44:04.069 --> 00:44:04.079 align:start position:0%
but it's accessible information there's
 
00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
a a group The National Association of
 
00:44:10.010 --> 00:44:10.020 align:start position:0%
retirement system administrators
 
00:44:13.970 --> 00:44:13.980 align:start position:0%
um Nazareth that does a lot of uh data
 
00:44:16.370 --> 00:44:16.380 align:start position:0%
compilation they they partner with a few
 
00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:17.640 align:start position:0%
other people on the public pension
 
00:44:20.690 --> 00:44:20.700 align:start position:0%
database and they have a grid multi-page
 
00:44:22.430 --> 00:44:22.440 align:start position:0%
grid of colas
 
00:44:25.250 --> 00:44:25.260 align:start position:0%
um you know that I can I can obtain and
 
00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
provide for the commission or if you
 
00:44:29.050 --> 00:44:29.060 align:start position:0%
just want New England states like
 
00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Mr Greenland will also be
 
00:44:34.250 --> 00:44:34.260 align:start position:0%
working on that with you so if you'd get
 
00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
together sure
 
00:44:39.650 --> 00:44:39.660 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that'll be of interest all
 
00:44:42.109 --> 00:44:42.119 align:start position:0%
right so it sounds like no one has any
 
00:44:45.050 --> 00:44:45.060 align:start position:0%
specific questions about these these
 
00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
proposals is that true
 
00:44:49.930 --> 00:44:49.940 align:start position:0%
so where did we're drifting off into
 
00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:51.960 align:start position:0%
brainstorming on what else we can do
 
00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
with the with the commission so
 
00:44:58.309 --> 00:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Carlin thank you
 
00:45:02.569 --> 00:45:02.579 align:start position:0%
all right so the obvious issue is
 
00:45:05.329 --> 00:45:05.339 align:start position:0%
cost of living increases
 
00:45:09.050 --> 00:45:09.060 align:start position:0%
which is something that keeps coming up
 
00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:10.490 align:start position:0%
which is something that keeps coming up
and

00:45:10.490 --> 00:45:10.500 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
it's as you've noticed we've been
 
00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
talking about it and I'd like to comment
 
00:45:18.890 --> 00:45:18.900 align:start position:0%
that that a cost of living increase is
 
00:45:22.190 --> 00:45:22.200 align:start position:0%
not a feature of a defined benefit plan
 
00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
a defined benefit plan guarantees you a
 
00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:26.329 align:start position:0%
a defined benefit plan guarantees you a
benefit

00:45:26.329 --> 00:45:26.339 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
and doesn't include any increases
 
00:45:34.430 --> 00:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
so we're talking about trying to
 
00:45:37.970 --> 00:45:37.980 align:start position:0%
add on to the basic plan a feature
 
00:45:39.589 --> 00:45:39.599 align:start position:0%
another feature that's not really
 
00:45:41.450 --> 00:45:41.460 align:start position:0%
compatible with it
 
00:45:46.250 --> 00:45:46.260 align:start position:0%
so anyone else Mr Martinez
 
00:45:48.290 --> 00:45:48.300 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:45:50.750 --> 00:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
uh could you tell us where you got that
 
00:45:53.930 --> 00:45:53.940 align:start position:0%
from that a caller is not part of
 
00:45:56.930 --> 00:45:56.940 align:start position:0%
defined benefits plan it's the def it's
 
00:45:59.390 --> 00:45:59.400 align:start position:0%
the definition of a defined benefit it's
 
00:46:03.290 --> 00:46:03.300 align:start position:0%
defined when you retire you're given so
 
00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
much percentage times your years of
 
00:46:08.450 --> 00:46:08.460 align:start position:0%
service times your final pay and I
 
00:46:10.450 --> 00:46:10.460 align:start position:0%
happen to have two defined benefit
 
00:46:14.990 --> 00:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
pensions myself and I am
 
00:46:17.450 --> 00:46:17.460 align:start position:0%
will confidently bet real money that I'm
 
00:46:19.010 --> 00:46:19.020 align:start position:0%
never going to get any increase in
 
00:46:20.450 --> 00:46:20.460 align:start position:0%
either of them
 
00:46:23.870 --> 00:46:23.880 align:start position:0%
if I may follow up is that that some
 
00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
patients their defined benefit don't
 
00:46:28.670 --> 00:46:28.680 align:start position:0%
have a caller or you're saying that this
 
00:46:30.950 --> 00:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
specific definition doesn't allow for a
 
00:46:33.170 --> 00:46:33.180 align:start position:0%
caller because that sounds new to me I
 
00:46:35.930 --> 00:46:35.940 align:start position:0%
never considered that
 
00:46:38.750 --> 00:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
is it normal to find benefit
 
00:46:42.349 --> 00:46:42.359 align:start position:0%
plan is as I said designed to provide a
 
00:46:44.329 --> 00:46:44.339 align:start position:0%
defined benefit so you know for sure how
 
00:46:46.130 --> 00:46:46.140 align:start position:0%
much you're going to get you don't have
 
00:46:48.290 --> 00:46:48.300 align:start position:0%
to worry about it going down
 
00:46:51.829 --> 00:46:51.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:53.690 --> 00:46:53.700 align:start position:0%
don't have to worry about it going up
 
00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:54.650 align:start position:0%
don't have to worry about it going up
either

00:46:54.650 --> 00:46:54.660 align:start position:0%
either
 
00:46:57.470 --> 00:46:57.480 align:start position:0%
that's that's an extra
 
00:47:00.290 --> 00:47:00.300 align:start position:0%
thank you I believe that when the
 
00:47:04.430 --> 00:47:04.440 align:start position:0%
legislature created outpatient in 1967
 
00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
there is a abundant evidence that they
 
00:47:12.589 --> 00:47:12.599 align:start position:0%
always intended that Cola was part of it
 
00:47:16.970 --> 00:47:16.980 align:start position:0%
it provided Cola from 1967
 
00:47:21.050 --> 00:47:21.060 align:start position:0%
on forward paid by the general fund
 
00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
in 1983 the legislature created the
 
00:47:28.849 --> 00:47:28.859 align:start position:0%
special accounts that paid callers for a
 
00:47:31.730 --> 00:47:31.740 align:start position:0%
period of an entire almost three decades
 
00:47:34.910 --> 00:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
28 years of performance
 
00:47:37.790 --> 00:47:37.800 align:start position:0%
work has taken the job performing in
 
00:47:39.829 --> 00:47:39.839 align:start position:0%
their you know position at work
 
00:47:41.630 --> 00:47:41.640 align:start position:0%
expecting the call and being paid the
 
00:47:45.309 --> 00:47:45.319 align:start position:0%
caller that was drastically stopped in
 
00:47:50.450 --> 00:47:50.460 align:start position:0%
2011 without any provision to uh
 
00:47:53.930 --> 00:47:53.940 align:start position:0%
continue that so it is a fact that the
 
00:47:59.210 --> 00:47:59.220 align:start position:0%
legislature has not made a law I Define
 
00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
definition or contribution of a cola in
 
00:48:04.910 --> 00:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
the system because none was needed
 
00:48:08.329 --> 00:48:08.339 align:start position:0%
we provided the colon now we know that
 
00:48:10.370 --> 00:48:10.380 align:start position:0%
this special account was not a perfect
 
00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
vehicle it had its problems but like any
 
00:48:15.109 --> 00:48:15.119 align:start position:0%
other vehicle that's not perfect you
 
00:48:17.150 --> 00:48:17.160 align:start position:0%
either fix it or replace it you don't
 
00:48:19.730 --> 00:48:19.740 align:start position:0%
stop driving which apparently is what we
 
00:48:22.550 --> 00:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
did we stopped providing the cola
 
00:48:25.730 --> 00:48:25.740 align:start position:0%
altogether which became a real problem
 
00:48:28.490 --> 00:48:28.500 align:start position:0%
for workers that live in a very short
 
00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
budget say for instance the average
 
00:48:34.430 --> 00:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
retirement for group one is in the 22
 
00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
000 something like that
 
00:48:39.050 --> 00:48:39.060 align:start position:0%
and that became very difficult so a
 
00:48:41.990 --> 00:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
caller it's not so much a luxury like
 
00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
going in a cruise that you only go if
 
00:48:46.730 --> 00:48:46.740 align:start position:0%
you can afford but it's more like a
 
00:48:50.050 --> 00:48:50.060 align:start position:0%
necessity of life whether you buy food
 
00:48:53.630 --> 00:48:53.640 align:start position:0%
medication pay your oil Bill and that's
 
00:48:56.990 --> 00:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
the category that we look at the cola so
 
00:48:59.390 --> 00:48:59.400 align:start position:0%
I think that I asked this commission to
 
00:49:02.930 --> 00:49:02.940 align:start position:0%
take a good look at ways to return to
 
00:49:06.050 --> 00:49:06.060 align:start position:0%
what the patient was intended to be and
 
00:49:08.329 --> 00:49:08.339 align:start position:0%
provide a cold benefit to both group one
 
00:49:09.589 --> 00:49:09.599 align:start position:0%
and two
 
00:49:14.270 --> 00:49:14.280 align:start position:0%
and uh and return to what we meant
 
00:49:18.770 --> 00:49:18.780 align:start position:0%
you know you thank you okay Mr real
 
00:49:20.270 --> 00:49:20.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
um while I don't necessarily disagree
 
00:49:24.650 --> 00:49:24.660 align:start position:0%
with your
 
00:49:24.660 --> 00:49:25.490 align:start position:0%
with your
um

00:49:25.490 --> 00:49:25.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:27.710 --> 00:49:27.720 align:start position:0%
your your definition of a defined
 
00:49:29.270 --> 00:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
benefit plan I think
 
00:49:31.130 --> 00:49:31.140 align:start position:0%
with all due respect to where we're all
 
00:49:35.150 --> 00:49:35.160 align:start position:0%
sitting here because many of us that had
 
00:49:37.010 --> 00:49:37.020 align:start position:0%
a defined benefit
 
00:49:39.829 --> 00:49:39.839 align:start position:0%
um wasn't didn't in fact end up being
 
00:49:43.130 --> 00:49:43.140 align:start position:0%
defined it was changed and I think if
 
00:49:45.230 --> 00:49:45.240 align:start position:0%
that benefit was changed in in one
 
00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:46.670 align:start position:0%
that benefit was changed in in one
regard

00:49:46.670 --> 00:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
regard
 
00:49:48.589 --> 00:49:48.599 align:start position:0%
um then it could potentially be changed
 
00:49:50.270 --> 00:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
the other way so I I would like to not
 
00:49:53.329 --> 00:49:53.339 align:start position:0%
dismiss any of these ideas on their
 
00:49:56.089 --> 00:49:56.099 align:start position:0%
surface and continue to discuss uh the
 
00:49:58.370 --> 00:49:58.380 align:start position:0%
potential for for all benefit changes
 
00:50:00.829 --> 00:50:00.839 align:start position:0%
that are going to be positive that's
 
00:50:04.430 --> 00:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
true exactly for Senator Gray
 
00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:05.390 align:start position:0%
true exactly for Senator Gray
um

00:50:05.390 --> 00:50:05.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:07.730 --> 00:50:07.740 align:start position:0%
trying to think outside the box when it
 
00:50:09.250 --> 00:50:09.260 align:start position:0%
comes to Kohl's
 
00:50:12.530 --> 00:50:12.540 align:start position:0%
one of the options though when I retired
 
00:50:15.530 --> 00:50:15.540 align:start position:0%
from the federal government is to take
 
00:50:17.329 --> 00:50:17.339 align:start position:0%
the money that was
 
00:50:19.309 --> 00:50:19.319 align:start position:0%
deposited in my Thrift Savings Account
 
00:50:21.650 --> 00:50:21.660 align:start position:0%
and buying an annuity and one of the
 
00:50:24.309 --> 00:50:24.319 align:start position:0%
options in that annuity could be
 
00:50:27.109 --> 00:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
that it be
 
00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
A reduced annuity but have a cola built
 
00:50:33.550 --> 00:50:33.560 align:start position:0%
into it from the insurance company
 
00:50:37.250 --> 00:50:37.260 align:start position:0%
certainly people who don't get to
 
00:50:40.490 --> 00:50:40.500 align:start position:0%
retirement age can withdraw money and
 
00:50:43.130 --> 00:50:43.140 align:start position:0%
again I don't know you know how that
 
00:50:46.550 --> 00:50:46.560 align:start position:0%
could fit or if it would ever fit but it
 
00:50:48.890 --> 00:50:48.900 align:start position:0%
is that kind of thinking that we need to
 
00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
do if you're trying to come up with a
 
00:50:55.370 --> 00:50:55.380 align:start position:0%
way to fund some kind of a cola it might
 
00:50:58.549 --> 00:50:58.559 align:start position:0%
be through an insurance policy where
 
00:51:01.849 --> 00:51:01.859 align:start position:0%
instead of getting X you get x minus
 
00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:04.680 align:start position:0%
something to start with and then the
 
00:51:07.130 --> 00:51:07.140 align:start position:0%
insurance company you know does the the
 
00:51:09.530 --> 00:51:09.540 align:start position:0%
call afterward again not throwing that
 
00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
out as a proposal but throwing it out
 
00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
you know so that you guys can start
 
00:51:16.069 --> 00:51:16.079 align:start position:0%
thinking about it to see if if there's
 
00:51:18.410 --> 00:51:18.420 align:start position:0%
anything in there that that could be
 
00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
done uh certainly
 
00:51:24.230 --> 00:51:24.240 align:start position:0%
you know I I understand that you know
 
00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
especially in periods of high inflation
 
00:51:28.370 --> 00:51:28.380 align:start position:0%
as we've had for the last couple of
 
00:51:31.250 --> 00:51:31.260 align:start position:0%
years that it becomes very very
 
00:51:34.370 --> 00:51:34.380 align:start position:0%
difficult uh to live on my hundred
 
00:51:36.049 --> 00:51:36.059 align:start position:0%
dollar a year you know legislative
 
00:51:39.710 --> 00:51:39.720 align:start position:0%
salary but uh but I I may make it work
 
00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:41.109 align:start position:0%
salary but uh but I I may make it work
so

00:51:41.109 --> 00:51:41.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:51:44.930 --> 00:51:44.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:46.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so we're kind of
 
00:51:47.690 --> 00:51:47.700 align:start position:0%
related to
 
00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
Senator Gray's remarks just now did you
 
00:51:51.650 --> 00:51:51.660 align:start position:0%
turn your mic on please sorry it's kind
 
00:51:53.329 --> 00:51:53.339 align:start position:0%
of related to Senator Gray's remarks
 
00:51:55.670 --> 00:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
right now and then to remarks he made a
 
00:51:57.290 --> 00:51:57.300 align:start position:0%
little bit earlier
 
00:52:00.049 --> 00:52:00.059 align:start position:0%
um I wanted us to kind of revisit as I
 
00:52:02.809 --> 00:52:02.819 align:start position:0%
mentioned last time what we discussed in
 
00:52:05.870 --> 00:52:05.880 align:start position:0%
the 2018 sorry
 
00:52:07.849 --> 00:52:07.859 align:start position:0%
um final report and so what I did is I
 
00:52:11.829 --> 00:52:11.839 align:start position:0%
had the uh discussion of the um
 
00:52:14.270 --> 00:52:14.280 align:start position:0%
public and employee Deferred
 
00:52:18.290 --> 00:52:18.300 align:start position:0%
Compensation Plan the 457b
 
00:52:21.410 --> 00:52:21.420 align:start position:0%
that we undertook during the San Diego
 
00:52:25.010 --> 00:52:25.020 align:start position:0%
retirement commission and a motion that
 
00:52:26.990 --> 00:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
was brought forward by representative
 
00:52:28.609 --> 00:52:28.619 align:start position:0%
McGuire and myself
 
00:52:31.970 --> 00:52:31.980 align:start position:0%
at that time to move to an opt out
 
00:52:34.190 --> 00:52:34.200 align:start position:0%
rather than opt-in program
 
00:52:36.170 --> 00:52:36.180 align:start position:0%
and part of our thinking of that time
 
00:52:40.910 --> 00:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
was that this this came upon the
 
00:52:42.589 --> 00:52:42.599 align:start position:0%
um you know after as part of the
 
00:52:44.210 --> 00:52:44.220 align:start position:0%
discussion about the colas and
 
00:52:45.530 --> 00:52:45.540 align:start position:0%
recognizing at that point in time
 
00:52:47.569 --> 00:52:47.579 align:start position:0%
because of the billion dollars that
 
00:52:49.970 --> 00:52:49.980 align:start position:0%
those figures that we had that would
 
00:52:52.309 --> 00:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
there be another way to
 
00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:55.140 align:start position:0%
help people in the future ensure against
 
00:52:55.140 --> 00:52:56.089 align:start position:0%
help people in the future ensure against
um

00:52:56.089 --> 00:52:56.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:58.190 --> 00:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
you know the difficulties of uh
 
00:53:00.770 --> 00:53:00.780 align:start position:0%
inflation and in a sense I looked at
 
00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
that time as the of the 457b is in a
 
00:53:06.530 --> 00:53:06.540 align:start position:0%
sense of vehicle for people to fund
 
00:53:09.589 --> 00:53:09.599 align:start position:0%
their own colas and um so we broadcast
 
00:53:12.250 --> 00:53:12.260 align:start position:0%
this proposal that failed in the 7-7
 
00:53:17.210 --> 00:53:17.220 align:start position:0%
motion but it said that there would be
 
00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
um an an opt out rather than opt in on
 
00:53:23.390 --> 00:53:23.400 align:start position:0%
the 457b and that there would be an
 
00:53:26.390 --> 00:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
escalation over time of the amount as
 
00:53:28.130 --> 00:53:28.140 align:start position:0%
the salary went up that went into that
 
00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:29.329 align:start position:0%
the salary went up that went into that
program

00:53:29.329 --> 00:53:29.339 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:53:31.609 --> 00:53:31.619 align:start position:0%
and that that would that would be a way
 
00:53:34.430 --> 00:53:34.440 align:start position:0%
of essentially supplementing by
 
00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
providing something that could in a
 
00:53:39.170 --> 00:53:39.180 align:start position:0%
sense provide a you know deal respond to
 
00:53:41.390 --> 00:53:41.400 align:start position:0%
the inflationary pressures over a period
 
00:53:42.890 --> 00:53:42.900 align:start position:0%
of time
 
00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:43.730 align:start position:0%
of time
um

00:53:43.730 --> 00:53:43.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:45.770 --> 00:53:45.780 align:start position:0%
and at that point in time there were a
 
00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
few place a few states that were
 
00:53:50.750 --> 00:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
starting to move towards uh opt out
 
00:53:53.809 --> 00:53:53.819 align:start position:0%
and um since that time uh this has been
 
00:53:55.190 --> 00:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
done more and more I think most
 
00:53:57.049 --> 00:53:57.059 align:start position:0%
comprehensively in California but of
 
00:53:59.630 --> 00:53:59.640 align:start position:0%
course the state is funding that part of
 
00:54:01.790 --> 00:54:01.800 align:start position:0%
that um which we're probably or may not
 
00:54:04.309 --> 00:54:04.319 align:start position:0%
do but I think that the um you know the
 
00:54:05.870 --> 00:54:05.880 align:start position:0%
opt out and even some of the statistics
 
00:54:09.170 --> 00:54:09.180 align:start position:0%
here that we got back in 2018 about the
 
00:54:11.690 --> 00:54:11.700 align:start position:0%
retention of people who had opt out
 
00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
instead of opt-in meant that most you
 
00:54:16.910 --> 00:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
know most employees really saw this as a
 
00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
as a good hedge against the the future
 
00:54:21.230 --> 00:54:21.240 align:start position:0%
so I just thought I I want us to bring
 
00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
it back back in and um Madam chair since
 
00:54:26.270 --> 00:54:26.280 align:start position:0%
you spearheaded this I thought maybe
 
00:54:28.490 --> 00:54:28.500 align:start position:0%
there's some things to say about it but
 
00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
it does provide us with another option
 
00:54:32.210 --> 00:54:32.220 align:start position:0%
if we can't get to
 
00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
um the cola I had a build in 2021
 
00:54:42.890 --> 00:54:42.900 align:start position:0%
that house bill 1563 that implemented
 
00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:44.210 align:start position:0%
that house bill 1563 that implemented
um

00:54:44.210 --> 00:54:44.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:45.950 --> 00:54:45.960 align:start position:0%
this plan
 
00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:47.329 align:start position:0%
this plan
and

00:54:47.329 --> 00:54:47.339 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:54:50.750 --> 00:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
it died in committee because there was
 
00:54:54.410 --> 00:54:54.420 align:start position:0%
no enthusiasm from anybody except myself
 
00:54:58.849 --> 00:54:58.859 align:start position:0%
in the 457 plan and we and I couldn't
 
00:54:58.859 --> 00:55:00.589 align:start position:0%
in the 457 plan and we and I couldn't
see

00:55:00.589 --> 00:55:00.599 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:55:04.069 --> 00:55:04.079 align:start position:0%
mandating that people join into it
 
00:55:06.230 --> 00:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
if they didn't appear to be interested
 
00:55:09.170 --> 00:55:09.180 align:start position:0%
and their the employer wasn't interested
 
00:55:11.089 --> 00:55:11.099 align:start position:0%
the unions weren't interested and no
 
00:55:15.410 --> 00:55:15.420 align:start position:0%
employees seemed to to be interested so
 
00:55:18.170 --> 00:55:18.180 align:start position:0%
uh I gave up at that point
 
00:55:20.569 --> 00:55:20.579 align:start position:0%
but if you're interested that's that's
 
00:55:22.549 --> 00:55:22.559 align:start position:0%
the description of the plan that's House
 
00:55:32.510 --> 00:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:35.390 --> 00:55:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:37.010 --> 00:55:37.020 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you Senator
 
00:55:39.710 --> 00:55:39.720 align:start position:0%
waters for this proposal
 
00:55:41.930 --> 00:55:41.940 align:start position:0%
um I I guess I do have some reservations
 
00:55:44.510 --> 00:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
with it I know that public employees
 
00:55:48.170 --> 00:55:48.180 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to participate in
 
00:55:48.180 --> 00:55:49.849 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to participate in
uh

00:55:49.849 --> 00:55:49.859 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:55:52.930 --> 00:55:52.940 align:start position:0%
deferred compensation plans currently
 
00:55:56.089 --> 00:55:56.099 align:start position:0%
and I think that when we we look at two
 
00:55:58.670 --> 00:55:58.680 align:start position:0%
things first we look at public employees
 
00:56:02.270 --> 00:56:02.280 align:start position:0%
now coming on to the job uh don't do not
 
00:56:03.890 --> 00:56:03.900 align:start position:0%
receive a medical subsidy will not
 
00:56:06.710 --> 00:56:06.720 align:start position:0%
receive a medical subsidy in retirement
 
00:56:09.770 --> 00:56:09.780 align:start position:0%
um so many are utilizing their current
 
00:56:12.349 --> 00:56:12.359 align:start position:0%
457 simply to fund their health
 
00:56:14.270 --> 00:56:14.280 align:start position:0%
insurance at retirement
 
00:56:16.849 --> 00:56:16.859 align:start position:0%
um I I can speak for many of the folks
 
00:56:18.530 --> 00:56:18.540 align:start position:0%
that I work with if that's what they're
 
00:56:21.109 --> 00:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
using that for currently and that's not
 
00:56:23.569 --> 00:56:23.579 align:start position:0%
accounting for inflation and the cost of
 
00:56:27.470 --> 00:56:27.480 align:start position:0%
of just simply living in retirement so
 
00:56:30.589 --> 00:56:30.599 align:start position:0%
I'm while I appreciate uh the Senate
 
00:56:33.230 --> 00:56:33.240 align:start position:0%
behind this I'm not sure that that would
 
00:56:35.290 --> 00:56:35.300 align:start position:0%
cover what we're looking to accomplish
 
00:56:37.370 --> 00:56:37.380 align:start position:0%
the other thing that I think is worth
 
00:56:41.450 --> 00:56:41.460 align:start position:0%
looking at is in the 2007 decennial
 
00:56:43.910 --> 00:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
report they recommended a two percent
 
00:56:47.150 --> 00:56:47.160 align:start position:0%
increase on employee rates to fund
 
00:56:50.270 --> 00:56:50.280 align:start position:0%
self-fund a cola those rates were in in
 
00:56:53.150 --> 00:56:53.160 align:start position:0%
fact increased by about two percent but
 
00:56:55.730 --> 00:56:55.740 align:start position:0%
those colas were never funded so I think
 
00:56:57.950 --> 00:56:57.960 align:start position:0%
it might be worthwhile looking at
 
00:57:01.150 --> 00:57:01.160 align:start position:0%
why that that money was redirected or
 
00:57:03.410 --> 00:57:03.420 align:start position:0%
for lack of a better term I should say
 
00:57:09.069 --> 00:57:09.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:10.970 --> 00:57:10.980 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:57:14.270 --> 00:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
um for for those points and uh
 
00:57:17.030 --> 00:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
I guess my kind of question
 
00:57:19.430 --> 00:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
for you Mr rule in a way was that given
 
00:57:22.490 --> 00:57:22.500 align:start position:0%
the earlier comments by Senator gray
 
00:57:24.829 --> 00:57:24.839 align:start position:0%
that if we had
 
00:57:27.710 --> 00:57:27.720 align:start position:0%
some more you know
 
00:57:30.890 --> 00:57:30.900 align:start position:0%
if we look more to the 457b at one and
 
00:57:33.290 --> 00:57:33.300 align:start position:0%
what it can do or could do I mean you
 
00:57:35.030 --> 00:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned the health benefits and that's
 
00:57:36.890 --> 00:57:36.900 align:start position:0%
important thing but you know over time
 
00:57:39.710 --> 00:57:39.720 align:start position:0%
if these are invested in the market that
 
00:57:39.720 --> 00:57:40.430 align:start position:0%
if these are invested in the market that
you

00:57:40.430 --> 00:57:40.440 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:57:42.710 --> 00:57:42.720 align:start position:0%
you know over time might if let's just
 
00:57:45.049 --> 00:57:45.059 align:start position:0%
say it's the the rate that we're making
 
00:57:47.150 --> 00:57:47.160 align:start position:0%
assumptions there that that is going to
 
00:57:49.730 --> 00:57:49.740 align:start position:0%
over 20 years mean something maybe even
 
00:57:51.230 --> 00:57:51.240 align:start position:0%
beyond the health insurance but I think
 
00:57:52.730 --> 00:57:52.740 align:start position:0%
that the other possibility as you
 
00:57:55.730 --> 00:57:55.740 align:start position:0%
mentioned you know would there be a
 
00:58:00.589 --> 00:58:00.599 align:start position:0%
possible employer match and then you
 
00:58:02.510 --> 00:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
know Senator gray raised the issue about
 
00:58:04.549 --> 00:58:04.559 align:start position:0%
maybe it would be part of a vocal
 
00:58:06.770 --> 00:58:06.780 align:start position:0%
contract negotiation now when I was in
 
00:58:09.370 --> 00:58:09.380 align:start position:0%
the Union at UNH my employment there
 
00:58:12.049 --> 00:58:12.059 align:start position:0%
these kinds of issues were part of our
 
00:58:14.510 --> 00:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
you know collective bargaining whereby
 
00:58:17.690 --> 00:58:17.700 align:start position:0%
we decided you know with their the
 
00:58:19.730 --> 00:58:19.740 align:start position:0%
report to take you know do something
 
00:58:21.470 --> 00:58:21.480 align:start position:0%
different with raises because of health
 
00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:23.210 align:start position:0%
different with raises because of health
benefit

00:58:23.210 --> 00:58:23.220 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
00:58:25.549 --> 00:58:25.559 align:start position:0%
um contributions and retirement benefits
 
00:58:27.349 --> 00:58:27.359 align:start position:0%
contributions so I mean I think that
 
00:58:29.569 --> 00:58:29.579 align:start position:0%
some things can come into play
 
00:58:32.569 --> 00:58:32.579 align:start position:0%
through a focus on a force 57b I mean I
 
00:58:34.549 --> 00:58:34.559 align:start position:0%
hear you and I hear the the chairs
 
00:58:36.349 --> 00:58:36.359 align:start position:0%
saying you know Box come at us into
 
00:58:39.190 --> 00:58:39.200 align:start position:0%
there at all you you shout it out nobody
 
00:58:41.510 --> 00:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
nobody responds I guess is the message
 
00:58:44.630 --> 00:58:44.640 align:start position:0%
in that but um I I seen what other
 
00:58:46.190 --> 00:58:46.200 align:start position:0%
states are doing with this
 
00:58:50.750 --> 00:58:50.760 align:start position:0%
and the success and that the opt-in you
 
00:58:52.730 --> 00:58:52.740 align:start position:0%
know may be a whole lot of maybe a
 
00:58:55.069 --> 00:58:55.079 align:start position:0%
formula for later regrets that's all
 
00:58:57.950 --> 00:58:57.960 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah and
 
00:59:01.010 --> 00:59:01.020 align:start position:0%
I I've yes Miss Campo
 
00:59:04.609 --> 00:59:04.619 align:start position:0%
let's see Kathy Stacy so I I do
 
00:59:08.630 --> 00:59:08.640 align:start position:0%
appreciate the uh 457 I think that it's
 
00:59:10.010 --> 00:59:10.020 align:start position:0%
been very useful I know that I have a
 
00:59:11.870 --> 00:59:11.880 align:start position:0%
lot of Staff who work for me who will
 
00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:13.089 align:start position:0%
lot of Staff who work for me who will
participate

00:59:13.089 --> 00:59:13.099 align:start position:0%
participate
 
00:59:15.950 --> 00:59:15.960 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly in this and I think it we
 
00:59:17.690 --> 00:59:17.700 align:start position:0%
don't want to foreclose tools in the
 
00:59:19.849 --> 00:59:19.859 align:start position:0%
toolbox and I think something like this
 
00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:22.140 align:start position:0%
is a is is a good tool and we should
 
00:59:25.430 --> 00:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
really think about it thank you
 
00:59:29.089 --> 00:59:29.099 align:start position:0%
nope one the the other method of
 
00:59:31.970 --> 00:59:31.980 align:start position:0%
providing a cola is what we've been
 
00:59:35.210 --> 00:59:35.220 align:start position:0%
doing for at least the last 15 years is
 
00:59:37.309 --> 00:59:37.319 align:start position:0%
somebody comes in brings in a bill and
 
00:59:39.470 --> 00:59:39.480 align:start position:0%
asks the legislature to approve it and
 
00:59:41.390 --> 00:59:41.400 align:start position:0%
we fund as much as we think we can
 
00:59:44.510 --> 00:59:44.520 align:start position:0%
afford from the budget that year which
 
00:59:47.450 --> 00:59:47.460 align:start position:0%
which was actually what was done in the
 
00:59:50.690 --> 00:59:50.700 align:start position:0%
60s and 70s we took what we
 
00:59:54.049 --> 00:59:54.059 align:start position:0%
the the retirees asked for an increase
 
00:59:56.150 --> 00:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
in the legislature said well we can
 
00:59:56.160 --> 00:59:57.170 align:start position:0%
in the legislature said well we can
afford

00:59:57.170 --> 00:59:57.180 align:start position:0%
afford
 
01:00:00.470 --> 01:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
this much and we'll give it to you which
 
01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:01.609 align:start position:0%
this much and we'll give it to you which
is

01:00:01.609 --> 01:00:01.619 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:00:04.910 --> 01:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
which has been known to work Mr Martinez
 
01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:08.940 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I believe that uh
 
01:00:12.490 --> 01:00:12.500 align:start position:0%
in my mind and I think a lot of workers
 
01:00:16.490 --> 01:00:16.500 align:start position:0%
that we think a good Cola benefits would
 
01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
be one that is aligned with the Social
 
01:00:22.549 --> 01:00:22.559 align:start position:0%
Security Administration coales so say
 
01:00:25.010 --> 01:00:25.020 align:start position:0%
for instance the Social Security gives a
 
01:00:27.289 --> 01:00:27.299 align:start position:0%
one percent caller that's what we do
 
01:00:29.809 --> 01:00:29.819 align:start position:0%
they give half percent that's what we do
 
01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:34.140 align:start position:0%
no then none three then three and that
 
01:00:36.650 --> 01:00:36.660 align:start position:0%
way it would save the legislature so
 
01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
much time that you can use for other
 
01:00:40.910 --> 01:00:40.920 align:start position:0%
things and other bills and all the other
 
01:00:43.309 --> 01:00:43.319 align:start position:0%
stuff that we have to do for the states
 
01:00:45.770 --> 01:00:45.780 align:start position:0%
and uh I think it'll be a win-win for
 
01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
everybody it would be good for workers
 
01:00:50.030 --> 01:00:50.040 align:start position:0%
good for employers it would be good for
 
01:00:52.370 --> 01:00:52.380 align:start position:0%
the state economy because that money is
 
01:00:54.109 --> 01:00:54.119 align:start position:0%
going to go right back into the economy
 
01:00:56.030 --> 01:00:56.040 align:start position:0%
trust me that not a thing is going to be
 
01:00:57.770 --> 01:00:57.780 align:start position:0%
saved and shipped away
 
01:00:59.930 --> 01:00:59.940 align:start position:0%
so that's something that I'd like us
 
01:01:01.910 --> 01:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
take a look at in other states that do
 
01:01:03.950 --> 01:01:03.960 align:start position:0%
that or if they don't we should be the
 
01:01:06.410 --> 01:01:06.420 align:start position:0%
first New Hampshire again to align our
 
01:01:08.270 --> 01:01:08.280 align:start position:0%
call a benefit with the Social Security
 
01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:10.130 align:start position:0%
call a benefit with the Social Security
benefits

01:01:10.130 --> 01:01:10.140 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
01:01:12.770 --> 01:01:12.780 align:start position:0%
and if we Define that on the RSA it will
 
01:01:16.010 --> 01:01:16.020 align:start position:0%
be unmistakably stated and won't have
 
01:01:19.670 --> 01:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
any problems okay thank you
 
01:01:23.809 --> 01:01:23.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:26.809 --> 01:01:26.819 align:start position:0%
representative leishman
 
01:01:28.370 --> 01:01:28.380 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and maybe you
 
01:01:30.650 --> 01:01:30.660 align:start position:0%
discussed this before I arrived so I
 
01:01:33.289 --> 01:01:33.299 align:start position:0%
apologize for perhaps asking the
 
01:01:35.329 --> 01:01:35.339 align:start position:0%
question but one of the things that
 
01:01:37.730 --> 01:01:37.740 align:start position:0%
brought us here was the Senate's
 
01:01:42.710 --> 01:01:42.720 align:start position:0%
rejection of House Bill 436 that as you
 
01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
worked very hard on in your committee
 
01:01:46.910 --> 01:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
and finance division one in particular
 
01:01:49.549 --> 01:01:49.559 align:start position:0%
worked very hard on and came up to a
 
01:01:52.970 --> 01:01:52.980 align:start position:0%
bipartisan solution which was rejected
 
01:01:56.450 --> 01:01:56.460 align:start position:0%
by the senate in House Bill 2 is it your
 
01:01:59.329 --> 01:01:59.339 align:start position:0%
intention to look at say 436 is you know
 
01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
Finance retained that bill
 
01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:04.130 align:start position:0%
Finance retained that bill
um the

01:02:04.130 --> 01:02:04.140 align:start position:0%
um the
 
01:02:08.410 --> 01:02:08.420 align:start position:0%
that's one way to implement something
 
01:02:12.530 --> 01:02:12.540 align:start position:0%
early next year would be to modify 436
 
01:02:14.809 --> 01:02:14.819 align:start position:0%
and send it in from Finance
 
01:02:17.510 --> 01:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
but the
 
01:02:20.450 --> 01:02:20.460 align:start position:0%
um we are currently costing out two
 
01:02:25.430 --> 01:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
options for The Gap people and we're not
 
01:02:27.829 --> 01:02:27.839 align:start position:0%
we're currently sort of brainstorming
 
01:02:31.250 --> 01:02:31.260 align:start position:0%
what longer term or what more widespread
 
01:02:33.950 --> 01:02:33.960 align:start position:0%
changes we might want to consider
 
01:02:36.109 --> 01:02:36.119 align:start position:0%
for the retirement system because
 
01:02:36.119 --> 01:02:38.569 align:start position:0%
for the retirement system because
there's

01:02:38.569 --> 01:02:38.579 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:02:42.829 --> 01:02:42.839 align:start position:0%
the the Gap group is a current problem
 
01:02:46.010 --> 01:02:46.020 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to solve but our chart
 
01:02:48.289 --> 01:02:48.299 align:start position:0%
the charge of this commission is broader
 
01:02:50.930 --> 01:02:50.940 align:start position:0%
than that we should look at overall do
 
01:02:52.309 --> 01:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
we want to make changes to the
 
01:02:54.950 --> 01:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
retirement system and if so what what
 
01:02:57.109 --> 01:02:57.119 align:start position:0%
are they and how would we decide if
 
01:02:59.390 --> 01:02:59.400 align:start position:0%
they're worthwhile
 
01:03:02.510 --> 01:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I read our charts I just recently
 
01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
looked at them again and I it
 
01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
letter b
 
01:03:10.970 --> 01:03:10.980 align:start position:0%
um I thought that this 436 would kind of
 
01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
fall into that charge that looking at
 
01:03:15.170 --> 01:03:15.180 align:start position:0%
you know not only the Gap but other
 
01:03:17.809 --> 01:03:17.819 align:start position:0%
issues but I think considerable progress
 
01:03:20.329 --> 01:03:20.339 align:start position:0%
was made last year during the budget
 
01:03:21.950 --> 01:03:21.960 align:start position:0%
process or this year during the budget
 
01:03:24.710 --> 01:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
process to address the Gap and I'd like
 
01:03:27.289 --> 01:03:27.299 align:start position:0%
to see that as a strong position of this
 
01:03:29.390 --> 01:03:29.400 align:start position:0%
commission to come out with a strong
 
01:03:31.910 --> 01:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
recommendation to deal with those nearly
 
01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:33.410 align:start position:0%
recommendation to deal with those nearly
800.

01:03:33.410 --> 01:03:33.420 align:start position:0%
800.
 
01:03:33.420 --> 01:03:34.789 align:start position:0%
800.
um

01:03:34.789 --> 01:03:34.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:38.329 --> 01:03:38.339 align:start position:0%
I'd like to present to the commission
 
01:03:40.730 --> 01:03:40.740 align:start position:0%
that we have more than one option to
 
01:03:44.630 --> 01:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
change the law the first one is that the
 
01:03:47.329 --> 01:03:47.339 align:start position:0%
commission can make a recommendation we
 
01:03:49.910 --> 01:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
introduce a bill that would be
 
01:03:52.010 --> 01:03:52.020 align:start position:0%
in which would be introduced in January
 
01:03:55.609 --> 01:03:55.619 align:start position:0%
and sent to committee detail cost and
 
01:03:59.089 --> 01:03:59.099 align:start position:0%
if we're lucky passed in June
 
01:04:02.270 --> 01:04:02.280 align:start position:0%
we also have bills in
 
01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
fine house finance and house Edna that
 
01:04:09.950 --> 01:04:09.960 align:start position:0%
could be used to make changes if they
 
01:04:12.650 --> 01:04:12.660 align:start position:0%
are agreed by the commission the the
 
01:04:16.010 --> 01:04:16.020 align:start position:0%
each committee could recommend it out of
 
01:04:20.270 --> 01:04:20.280 align:start position:0%
the 436 out of Finance uh I forget what
 
01:04:22.430 --> 01:04:22.440 align:start position:0%
the number is that I've got
 
01:04:24.829 --> 01:04:24.839 align:start position:0%
uh 449
 
01:04:27.410 --> 01:04:27.420 align:start position:0%
we could amend that either of those
 
01:04:30.230 --> 01:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
bills to do whatever we thought was
 
01:04:32.750 --> 01:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate from the commission and send
 
01:04:35.089 --> 01:04:35.099 align:start position:0%
it to the house floor in January
 
01:04:37.730 --> 01:04:37.740 align:start position:0%
that would be the fastest way to do it
 
01:04:39.950 --> 01:04:39.960 align:start position:0%
or if we know exactly what we want we
 
01:04:42.829 --> 01:04:42.839 align:start position:0%
could submit it in September
 
01:04:46.130 --> 01:04:46.140 align:start position:0%
each legislature legislator can submit a
 
01:04:48.530 --> 01:04:48.540 align:start position:0%
bill in September but I think the
 
01:04:51.010 --> 01:04:51.020 align:start position:0%
commission itself will be
 
01:04:54.289 --> 01:04:54.299 align:start position:0%
would be better served by amending one
 
01:04:55.970 --> 01:04:55.980 align:start position:0%
of the retained bills those will be
 
01:04:55.980 --> 01:05:00.410 align:start position:0%
of the retained bills those will be
later

01:05:00.410 --> 01:05:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:00.420 --> 01:05:04.010 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:05:04.010 --> 01:05:04.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:07.309 --> 01:05:07.319 align:start position:0%
anyone else want to speak on oncolas or
 
01:05:11.569 --> 01:05:11.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:15.049 --> 01:05:15.059 align:start position:0%
are there any other concerns that
 
01:05:18.950 --> 01:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure are considered
 
01:05:21.589 --> 01:05:21.599 align:start position:0%
I'd like to mention that we
 
01:05:24.289 --> 01:05:24.299 align:start position:0%
ought to look very hard at how we're
 
01:05:27.470 --> 01:05:27.480 align:start position:0%
funding the retirement system because
 
01:05:29.530 --> 01:05:29.540 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:05:32.930 --> 01:05:32.940 align:start position:0%
most of the changes we make get flowed
 
01:05:36.109 --> 01:05:36.119 align:start position:0%
directly down to the property taxpayers
 
01:05:36.119 --> 01:05:37.970 align:start position:0%
directly down to the property taxpayers
and

01:05:37.970 --> 01:05:37.980 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:05:37.980 --> 01:05:40.250 align:start position:0%
and
that's

01:05:40.250 --> 01:05:40.260 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:05:42.289 --> 01:05:42.299 align:start position:0%
that's a concern of a lot of my
 
01:05:45.349 --> 01:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
constituents and I'm sure we all pay our
 
01:05:47.210 --> 01:05:47.220 align:start position:0%
own property taxes
 
01:05:48.770 --> 01:05:48.780 align:start position:0%
so I'd like
 
01:05:52.910 --> 01:05:52.920 align:start position:0%
I'd like to to if we make changes to
 
01:05:56.329 --> 01:05:56.339 align:start position:0%
seriously consider funding them
 
01:05:59.089 --> 01:05:59.099 align:start position:0%
from the state rather than slowing it
 
01:06:05.289 --> 01:06:05.299 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:09.410 --> 01:06:09.420 align:start position:0%
yes Mr Martinez thank you for bringing
 
01:06:11.089 --> 01:06:11.099 align:start position:0%
this subject up
 
01:06:13.789 --> 01:06:13.799 align:start position:0%
as a long time resident of the State of
 
01:06:16.130 --> 01:06:16.140 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I noticed that our
 
01:06:19.250 --> 01:06:19.260 align:start position:0%
property tax have been infected a lot by
 
01:06:23.529 --> 01:06:23.539 align:start position:0%
that and I'll say the most significant
 
01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:27.660 align:start position:0%
and effective way to reduce our tax
 
01:06:27.660 --> 01:06:28.549 align:start position:0%
and effective way to reduce our tax
rates

01:06:28.549 --> 01:06:28.559 align:start position:0%
rates
 
01:06:32.150 --> 01:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
would be if the state returned to pay a
 
01:06:34.630 --> 01:06:34.640 align:start position:0%
portion of the cost of the teachers
 
01:06:36.650 --> 01:06:36.660 align:start position:0%
firefighters and police officers
 
01:06:36.660 --> 01:06:38.510 align:start position:0%
firefighters and police officers
retirement

01:06:38.510 --> 01:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
retirement
 
01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:41.640 align:start position:0%
as you know in 1977
 
01:06:45.829 --> 01:06:45.839 align:start position:0%
we were paying 40 of the cost for the
 
01:06:48.289 --> 01:06:48.299 align:start position:0%
teachers and it was reduced to 35
 
01:06:52.190 --> 01:06:52.200 align:start position:0%
percent in 1977 when we also picked up
 
01:06:54.410 --> 01:06:54.420 align:start position:0%
the cost for police officers and
 
01:06:58.010 --> 01:06:58.020 align:start position:0%
firefighters at 35 percent so we're
 
01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
paying 35 percent for teachers police
 
01:07:03.829 --> 01:07:03.839 align:start position:0%
firefighters and police officers this
 
01:07:08.270 --> 01:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
was a good move because it allowed the
 
01:07:11.150 --> 01:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
tax rate to be less properties were
 
01:07:13.089 --> 01:07:13.099 align:start position:0%
lower in price
 
01:07:15.349 --> 01:07:15.359 align:start position:0%
rents were affordable
 
01:07:18.670 --> 01:07:18.680 align:start position:0%
and communities didn't have to
 
01:07:21.109 --> 01:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
really go through what we're going today
 
01:07:24.230 --> 01:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
to make all the payments and I'll make
 
01:07:26.870 --> 01:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
ends meets but I'll say this another
 
01:07:31.370 --> 01:07:31.380 align:start position:0%
reason is that this is a common good
 
01:07:34.130 --> 01:07:34.140 align:start position:0%
families are allowed to travel move from
 
01:07:36.349 --> 01:07:36.359 align:start position:0%
north south west to east so it can move
 
01:07:38.390 --> 01:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
from one part of the state another
 
01:07:41.029 --> 01:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
you could have an increase to your
 
01:07:43.549 --> 01:07:43.559 align:start position:0%
public schools unannounced and you have
 
01:07:45.890 --> 01:07:45.900 align:start position:0%
to provide that education same thing
 
01:07:48.770 --> 01:07:48.780 align:start position:0%
with the fire events all the towns come
 
01:07:50.569 --> 01:07:50.579 align:start position:0%
in to help same thing with the police
 
01:07:52.549 --> 01:07:52.559 align:start position:0%
event so it's a common good that can be
 
01:07:55.130 --> 01:07:55.140 align:start position:0%
shared with the state furthermore the
 
01:07:57.289 --> 01:07:57.299 align:start position:0%
state have other Pockets where to get
 
01:07:58.730 --> 01:07:58.740 align:start position:0%
that money from like the federal
 
01:08:01.549 --> 01:08:01.559 align:start position:0%
government grants and many other types
 
01:08:04.250 --> 01:08:04.260 align:start position:0%
of a system while citizen Town only have
 
01:08:07.069 --> 01:08:07.079 align:start position:0%
one main source of income and that is
 
01:08:10.849 --> 01:08:10.859 align:start position:0%
your wallet in mind and and that's how
 
01:08:14.270 --> 01:08:14.280 align:start position:0%
it is so I strongly encourage that and I
 
01:08:16.249 --> 01:08:16.259 align:start position:0%
think to start we should consider at
 
01:08:19.910 --> 01:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
minimum of 10 of that cost for uh all
 
01:08:23.150 --> 01:08:23.160 align:start position:0%
these groups to be paid by the state
 
01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:27.480 align:start position:0%
to decision balance employers thank you
 
01:08:29.630 --> 01:08:29.640 align:start position:0%
Senator Greg
 
01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:30.709 align:start position:0%
Senator Greg
um

01:08:30.709 --> 01:08:30.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:33.829 --> 01:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
a question on that suggestion are you
 
01:08:36.110 --> 01:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
suggesting that we actually go back to
 
01:08:38.990 --> 01:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
what we were paying way back when and
 
01:08:41.930 --> 01:08:41.940 align:start position:0%
reduce the amount that we're getting in
 
01:08:44.209 --> 01:08:44.219 align:start position:0%
Roman Mills tax that we have increased
 
01:08:46.490 --> 01:08:46.500 align:start position:0%
and reduced the amount that we're paying
 
01:08:49.030 --> 01:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
to the cities and towns in Rhoden Bridge
 
01:08:51.229 --> 01:08:51.239 align:start position:0%
there's a whole bunch of other things
 
01:08:53.150 --> 01:08:53.160 align:start position:0%
that we increased
 
01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:55.370 align:start position:0%
that we increased
okay

01:08:55.370 --> 01:08:55.380 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:08:57.650 --> 01:08:57.660 align:start position:0%
or we wouldn't you know are you
 
01:08:59.510 --> 01:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
suggesting that we decrease those so
 
01:09:02.030 --> 01:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
that we can go back and increase you
 
01:09:03.490 --> 01:09:03.500 align:start position:0%
know the thing that you're asking for
 
01:09:06.050 --> 01:09:06.060 align:start position:0%
again I'm looking for balance I'm
 
01:09:08.990 --> 01:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
looking for fairness okay thank you
 
01:09:11.650 --> 01:09:11.660 align:start position:0%
clarify what I'm suggesting
 
01:09:14.870 --> 01:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
yes please no we're not suggesting that
 
01:09:19.010 --> 01:09:19.020 align:start position:0%
uh there's no really no really need to
 
01:09:22.070 --> 01:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
pitch like rooms and meals against you
 
01:09:23.930 --> 01:09:23.940 align:start position:0%
know profit taxes or the towns and all
 
01:09:27.050 --> 01:09:27.060 align:start position:0%
this this is something that we should
 
01:09:29.269 --> 01:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
suggests they say that we should look
 
01:09:31.910 --> 01:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
seriously into that because I think it's
 
01:09:34.729 --> 01:09:34.739 align:start position:0%
accomplishable we did this before at a
 
01:09:37.249 --> 01:09:37.259 align:start position:0%
much higher rates when we had a lot less
 
01:09:40.130 --> 01:09:40.140 align:start position:0%
income the state has ways and means that
 
01:09:42.169 --> 01:09:42.179 align:start position:0%
you can get that cities and towns are
 
01:09:44.269 --> 01:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
not equipped for that tiny little towns
 
01:09:46.430 --> 01:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
all they have is a bill and a few
 
01:09:48.050 --> 01:09:48.060 align:start position:0%
taxpayers will make ends meet it's very
 
01:09:50.749 --> 01:09:50.759 align:start position:0%
difficult so I I say about my suggestion
 
01:09:52.910 --> 01:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair now
 
01:09:57.050 --> 01:09:57.060 align:start position:0%
anyone Mr real thank you madam chair and
 
01:09:58.310 --> 01:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
I appreciate
 
01:10:01.310 --> 01:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
um your thoughts behind uh how we
 
01:10:02.750 --> 01:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
continue to fund retirement in the
 
01:10:04.370 --> 01:10:04.380 align:start position:0%
future I think
 
01:10:05.810 --> 01:10:05.820 align:start position:0%
um you know going back to what
 
01:10:08.990 --> 01:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
representative leishman was speaking of
 
01:10:12.290 --> 01:10:12.300 align:start position:0%
um with House Bill 436 and the
 
01:10:15.590 --> 01:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
provisions of that that did come with a
 
01:10:17.330 --> 01:10:17.340 align:start position:0%
proposed funding mechanism and I think
 
01:10:21.169 --> 01:10:21.179 align:start position:0%
it'd be worthwhile as we look forward to
 
01:10:21.179 --> 01:10:21.910 align:start position:0%
it'd be worthwhile as we look forward to
um

01:10:21.910 --> 01:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:24.410 --> 01:10:24.420 align:start position:0%
improving some of these benefits within
 
01:10:26.030 --> 01:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
this commission to consider that as a
 
01:10:27.709 --> 01:10:27.719 align:start position:0%
funding source which was the
 
01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
communications tax okay
 
01:10:34.450 --> 01:10:34.460 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters
 
01:10:37.850 --> 01:10:37.860 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um
 
01:10:40.610 --> 01:10:40.620 align:start position:0%
an issue that I I we did talk about a
 
01:10:42.790 --> 01:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
little bit last time on the multiplier
 
01:10:45.290 --> 01:10:45.300 align:start position:0%
was looking at it
 
01:10:48.290 --> 01:10:48.300 align:start position:0%
um it beyond what was included
 
01:10:51.709 --> 01:10:51.719 align:start position:0%
in Bradley's amendments and we had some
 
01:10:51.719 --> 01:10:53.390 align:start position:0%
in Bradley's amendments and we had some
discussion

01:10:53.390 --> 01:10:53.400 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:10:55.370 --> 01:10:55.380 align:start position:0%
um at that time about whether or not
 
01:10:58.310 --> 01:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
this the speaker and the president
 
01:11:00.350 --> 01:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
in terms of what they're willing to fund
 
01:11:03.290 --> 01:11:03.300 align:start position:0%
for Equatorial studies would be able to
 
01:11:06.590 --> 01:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
look at the issue raised about
 
01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:07.430 align:start position:0%
look at the issue raised about
um

01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:11.870 --> 01:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
looking at the multiplier for beyond
 
01:11:14.570 --> 01:11:14.580 align:start position:0%
what we was being looked at in those um
 
01:11:16.430 --> 01:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
in the broadly amendments and I think
 
01:11:17.870 --> 01:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
that got kind of left hanging because we
 
01:11:20.510 --> 01:11:20.520 align:start position:0%
did vote as a commission to just fund
 
01:11:23.689 --> 01:11:23.699 align:start position:0%
the uh Actuarial on on the two Bradley
 
01:11:27.770 --> 01:11:27.780 align:start position:0%
amendments so I um I do think that if
 
01:11:30.050 --> 01:11:30.060 align:start position:0%
Senator Susie were here she'd certainly
 
01:11:32.030 --> 01:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
be raised in that issue about should we
 
01:11:35.149 --> 01:11:35.159 align:start position:0%
look at the multiplier more broadly and
 
01:11:38.030 --> 01:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
so I just didn't know where we were on
 
01:11:40.070 --> 01:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
that and how we might study it and you
 
01:11:41.990 --> 01:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
know whether
 
01:11:43.669 --> 01:11:43.679 align:start position:0%
um the speaker and the president were
 
01:11:44.750 --> 01:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
amenable I mean we had a little
 
01:11:46.189 --> 01:11:46.199 align:start position:0%
discussion about last time about if
 
01:11:48.770 --> 01:11:48.780 align:start position:0%
we're extending that the reason that we
 
01:11:51.229 --> 01:11:51.239 align:start position:0%
sent those
 
01:11:51.239 --> 01:11:54.050 align:start position:0%
sent those
um

01:11:54.050 --> 01:11:54.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:56.930 --> 01:11:56.940 align:start position:0%
plans from Senator Bradley to the
 
01:11:59.689 --> 01:11:59.699 align:start position:0%
actuaries is that we were considering
 
01:12:01.209 --> 01:12:01.219 align:start position:0%
adopting them
 
01:12:04.790 --> 01:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
very quickly if we were to make a change
 
01:12:07.550 --> 01:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
to the multiplier long term that would
 
01:12:11.390 --> 01:12:11.400 align:start position:0%
be presumably be in a bill and you could
 
01:12:15.169 --> 01:12:15.179 align:start position:0%
use some of these as you know
 
01:12:17.270 --> 01:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
suggestions on how much it would cost
 
01:12:19.310 --> 01:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
but we'd get the analysis as part of the
 
01:12:21.770 --> 01:12:21.780 align:start position:0%
bill thank you and that that thanks for
 
01:12:23.209 --> 01:12:23.219 align:start position:0%
reminding me that makes sense so I guess
 
01:12:23.219 --> 01:12:23.990 align:start position:0%
reminding me that makes sense so I guess
that

01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:12:26.090 --> 01:12:26.100 align:start position:0%
my point being this is that if we're
 
01:12:28.370 --> 01:12:28.380 align:start position:0%
looking at our in our conversation now
 
01:12:31.189 --> 01:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
uh things that might become part of our
 
01:12:32.930 --> 01:12:32.940 align:start position:0%
recommendations of the commission I
 
01:12:34.850 --> 01:12:34.860 align:start position:0%
guess that I would put that one out
 
01:12:38.090 --> 01:12:38.100 align:start position:0%
there that you know maybe looking at
 
01:12:40.370 --> 01:12:40.380 align:start position:0%
and potential legislation about the
 
01:12:42.050 --> 01:12:42.060 align:start position:0%
multiplier might be something we would
 
01:12:44.510 --> 01:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
discuss as a possible recommendation of
 
01:12:47.330 --> 01:12:47.340 align:start position:0%
the commission as we move forward
 
01:12:49.669 --> 01:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
okay so that would be multiplier for
 
01:12:55.250 --> 01:12:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:57.590 --> 01:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to recall a conversation from
 
01:12:58.970 --> 01:12:58.980 align:start position:0%
last time because I didn't see it in the
 
01:13:00.709 --> 01:13:00.719 align:start position:0%
minutes but I know that Senator Susie
 
01:13:02.390 --> 01:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
did bring it up but I think it was for
 
01:13:04.790 --> 01:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
the rest of uh group two as I as I
 
01:13:10.030 --> 01:13:10.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:12.950 --> 01:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
anyone else have a an issue they want to
 
01:13:15.890 --> 01:13:15.900 align:start position:0%
bring up is it Mr Earl thank you madam
 
01:13:15.900 --> 01:13:16.669 align:start position:0%
bring up is it Mr Earl thank you madam
chair

01:13:16.669 --> 01:13:16.679 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:13:19.790 --> 01:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
um are we still in the spirit of uh of
 
01:13:22.669 --> 01:13:22.679 align:start position:0%
brainstorming a long-term issues okay I
 
01:13:24.709 --> 01:13:24.719 align:start position:0%
don't want to muddy the waters here but
 
01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
um I think you know one of the things
 
01:13:29.149 --> 01:13:29.159 align:start position:0%
that that came up during discussions for
 
01:13:33.890 --> 01:13:33.900 align:start position:0%
House Bill 436 was the concern about the
 
01:13:37.310 --> 01:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
ability to spike one's pension in final
 
01:13:40.790 --> 01:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
years of service which I think
 
01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:41.390 align:start position:0%
years of service which I think
um

01:13:41.390 --> 01:13:41.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:45.350 --> 01:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
by and large uh most of us agree that
 
01:13:47.810 --> 01:13:47.820 align:start position:0%
for the for the health of the retirement
 
01:13:50.090 --> 01:13:50.100 align:start position:0%
system in the long term
 
01:13:52.970 --> 01:13:52.980 align:start position:0%
um sustainability of it that spiking is
 
01:13:54.830 --> 01:13:54.840 align:start position:0%
is not something that we want to see
 
01:13:57.110 --> 01:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
occur again but one of the things that I
 
01:13:58.490 --> 01:13:58.500 align:start position:0%
want to talk about
 
01:14:02.149 --> 01:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
is how uh
 
01:14:04.070 --> 01:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
around our Recruitment and Retention
 
01:14:08.090 --> 01:14:08.100 align:start position:0%
issue we're forcing many employees to
 
01:14:11.090 --> 01:14:11.100 align:start position:0%
have to work extra hours spend extra
 
01:14:11.100 --> 01:14:12.350 align:start position:0%
have to work extra hours spend extra
time

01:14:12.350 --> 01:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:14:14.570 --> 01:14:14.580 align:start position:0%
um you know on the job in order to fill
 
01:14:17.510 --> 01:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
vacancies that the municipalities are
 
01:14:20.510 --> 01:14:20.520 align:start position:0%
unable to fill with new recruits
 
01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
um and and in order to do that we're
 
01:14:27.070 --> 01:14:27.080 align:start position:0%
having to pay uh our current
 
01:14:30.229 --> 01:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
employees overtime to fill these shifts
 
01:14:32.450 --> 01:14:32.460 align:start position:0%
and in many cases they're being forced
 
01:14:34.790 --> 01:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
to work those shifts you you heard of
 
01:14:37.010 --> 01:14:37.020 align:start position:0%
the issues we're having in our state
 
01:14:39.410 --> 01:14:39.420 align:start position:0%
prisons and
 
01:14:41.030 --> 01:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
um having the National Guard having to
 
01:14:44.149 --> 01:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
staff those positions uh speaking with
 
01:14:47.570 --> 01:14:47.580 align:start position:0%
Mr Campo earlier he was talking about
 
01:14:51.290 --> 01:14:51.300 align:start position:0%
how the state troopers are uh
 
01:14:53.689 --> 01:14:53.699 align:start position:0%
inching closer and closer to about 75
 
01:14:57.050 --> 01:14:57.060 align:start position:0%
vacancies which is concerning so when we
 
01:14:59.450 --> 01:14:59.460 align:start position:0%
talk about trying to fill these
 
01:15:03.590 --> 01:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
these positions with current staff in in
 
01:15:05.750 --> 01:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
forcing our current employees to work
 
01:15:08.209 --> 01:15:08.219 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a significant level
 
01:15:09.490 --> 01:15:09.500 align:start position:0%
of burnout
 
01:15:13.610 --> 01:15:13.620 align:start position:0%
versus the uh what is the actual
 
01:15:15.950 --> 01:15:15.960 align:start position:0%
incentive to remain on the job and one
 
01:15:17.870 --> 01:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
of the things that we're currently doing
 
01:15:20.990 --> 01:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
that was changed in 2011
 
01:15:24.250 --> 01:15:24.260 align:start position:0%
is we're carving out the overtime
 
01:15:26.750 --> 01:15:26.760 align:start position:0%
compensation and we're calculating it
 
01:15:29.810 --> 01:15:29.820 align:start position:0%
differently than we did prior to 2011.
 
01:15:33.290 --> 01:15:33.300 align:start position:0%
now prior to 2011 uh one's overtime was
 
01:15:36.649 --> 01:15:36.659 align:start position:0%
calculated as base pay along with about
 
01:15:42.050 --> 01:15:42.060 align:start position:0%
15 other uh things uh and in 2011 that
 
01:15:44.149 --> 01:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
was pulled out and calculated as
 
01:15:46.090 --> 01:15:46.100 align:start position:0%
compensation over base
 
01:15:49.070 --> 01:15:49.080 align:start position:0%
now I understand the concerns of spiking
 
01:15:52.070 --> 01:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
but these are actual hours worked these
 
01:15:54.530 --> 01:15:54.540 align:start position:0%
are these are hours that employees are
 
01:15:57.350 --> 01:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
actually present and accounted for and
 
01:15:59.630 --> 01:15:59.640 align:start position:0%
working and in many cases as I mentioned
 
01:16:01.910 --> 01:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
forced to be there and I think we should
 
01:16:06.790 --> 01:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
take a deep look at those overtime hours
 
01:16:09.530 --> 01:16:09.540 align:start position:0%
as as being calculated as part of the
 
01:16:12.169 --> 01:16:12.179 align:start position:0%
base pay once again which
 
01:16:15.169 --> 01:16:15.179 align:start position:0%
I think is is reasonable when you look
 
01:16:17.830 --> 01:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
at all the provisions of House Bill 436
 
01:16:20.229 --> 01:16:20.239 align:start position:0%
to pull that one out
 
01:16:22.669 --> 01:16:22.679 align:start position:0%
it quite simply it passes the straight
 
01:16:25.189 --> 01:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
face test to take a look at that so
 
01:16:25.199 --> 01:16:27.229 align:start position:0%
face test to take a look at that so
okay

01:16:27.229 --> 01:16:27.239 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:16:30.110 --> 01:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that
 
01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:31.209 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that
um

01:16:31.209 --> 01:16:31.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:34.189 --> 01:16:34.199 align:start position:0%
restricting overtime beyond what one
 
01:16:36.229 --> 01:16:36.239 align:start position:0%
worked throughout your career
 
01:16:39.649 --> 01:16:39.659 align:start position:0%
was the intent of house bill of the
 
01:16:42.410 --> 01:16:42.420 align:start position:0%
changes in 2011 because there are people
 
01:16:44.030 --> 01:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
that work significant amounts of
 
01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:45.229 align:start position:0%
that work significant amounts of
overtime

01:16:45.229 --> 01:16:45.239 align:start position:0%
overtime
 
01:16:50.090 --> 01:16:50.100 align:start position:0%
from day one and and but it is possible
 
01:16:52.970 --> 01:16:52.980 align:start position:0%
to choose to work overtime in your final
 
01:16:55.850 --> 01:16:55.860 align:start position:0%
year just had your pension
 
01:17:00.169 --> 01:17:00.179 align:start position:0%
which that's the definition of spiking
 
01:17:02.870 --> 01:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
but if it's mandatory over time I think
 
01:17:04.729 --> 01:17:04.739 align:start position:0%
we ought to look very hard at like you
 
01:17:09.890 --> 01:17:09.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:11.270 --> 01:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:17:15.110 --> 01:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
um and I and I was certain that that uh
 
01:17:17.209 --> 01:17:17.219 align:start position:0%
this would be a part of the conversation
 
01:17:19.070 --> 01:17:19.080 align:start position:0%
and just as
 
01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
um to add a little bit more context
 
01:17:24.050 --> 01:17:24.060 align:start position:0%
there are other anti-spiking Provisions
 
01:17:27.950 --> 01:17:27.960 align:start position:0%
that exist that would uh currently
 
01:17:32.030 --> 01:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
limit that from happening for example in
 
01:17:33.890 --> 01:17:33.900 align:start position:0%
the final 12 months earnable
 
01:17:36.110 --> 01:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
compensation is limited to 150 percent
 
01:17:38.090 --> 01:17:38.100 align:start position:0%
of the previous 12 months
 
01:17:40.910 --> 01:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
uh unused sick and vacation time is not
 
01:17:43.270 --> 01:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
calculated as earnable comp
 
01:17:45.890 --> 01:17:45.900 align:start position:0%
the calculations are averaged over five
 
01:17:48.290 --> 01:17:48.300 align:start position:0%
years not three
 
01:17:51.770 --> 01:17:51.780 align:start position:0%
um in in many cases I would say most I'm
 
01:17:54.169 --> 01:17:54.179 align:start position:0%
not I'm unaware of a municipality uh
 
01:17:56.930 --> 01:17:56.940 align:start position:0%
that doesn't regulate spiking in one
 
01:18:01.030 --> 01:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
area or another for instance over time
 
01:18:05.090 --> 01:18:05.100 align:start position:0%
at least for for firefighters uh has to
 
01:18:07.850 --> 01:18:07.860 align:start position:0%
be at least offered in a fair and
 
01:18:09.310 --> 01:18:09.320 align:start position:0%
Equitable manner
 
01:18:13.430 --> 01:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
throughout its Personnel so it prevents
 
01:18:16.970 --> 01:18:16.980 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for one individual from
 
01:18:18.290 --> 01:18:18.300 align:start position:0%
spiking their pension and another
 
01:18:22.090 --> 01:18:22.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:24.290 --> 01:18:24.300 align:start position:0%
all right well we'll take to keep that
 
01:18:28.310 --> 01:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
as an item any other issues that need to
 
01:18:32.510 --> 01:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:34.850 --> 01:18:34.860 align:start position:0%
Mr Fuller yes
 
01:18:36.830 --> 01:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
yeah and if I can just add on to that
 
01:18:38.209 --> 01:18:38.219 align:start position:0%
because I think you definitely Mr rule
 
01:18:39.350 --> 01:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
makes some really good points with the
 
01:18:40.610 --> 01:18:40.620 align:start position:0%
overtime payment so it doesn't really
 
01:18:42.410 --> 01:18:42.420 align:start position:0%
affect our group
 
01:18:44.450 --> 01:18:44.460 align:start position:0%
um but I think look bringing back some
 
01:18:46.070 --> 01:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
of those end of career payments but
 
01:18:48.830 --> 01:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
again just also emphasizing wanting to
 
01:18:50.630 --> 01:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
manage this the whole spiking thing and
 
01:18:51.950 --> 01:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
not looking to obviously have someone
 
01:18:54.169 --> 01:18:54.179 align:start position:0%
obviously dramatically increase their
 
01:18:56.390 --> 01:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
pay is definitely uh I mean that's it's
 
01:18:58.970 --> 01:18:58.980 align:start position:0%
not it's not fair it's not right but
 
01:19:00.470 --> 01:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
um I know it was something that I know
 
01:19:02.270 --> 01:19:02.280 align:start position:0%
at the very least in group two our group
 
01:19:04.189 --> 01:19:04.199 align:start position:0%
for instance used to be able to have
 
01:19:05.990 --> 01:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
some end of career payments that I know
 
01:19:07.850 --> 01:19:07.860 align:start position:0%
they used to be credited I know they
 
01:19:12.169 --> 01:19:12.179 align:start position:0%
were ceased in 2011 so it would be good
 
01:19:13.550 --> 01:19:13.560 align:start position:0%
to see some of those come back but again
 
01:19:15.950 --> 01:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
in a reasonable form if you will so
 
01:19:17.810 --> 01:19:17.820 align:start position:0%
definitely with some
 
01:19:20.209 --> 01:19:20.219 align:start position:0%
safeguards if you will yeah the trouble
 
01:19:23.750 --> 01:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
the trouble with the spiking is that if
 
01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
you're working overtime throughout your
 
01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
career the
 
01:19:31.910 --> 01:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
that's built in if you're final year or
 
01:19:34.669 --> 01:19:34.679 align:start position:0%
years are a lot bigger than your
 
01:19:36.770 --> 01:19:36.780 align:start position:0%
previous years you haven't paid into the
 
01:19:40.550 --> 01:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
system because the estimates are
 
01:19:43.910 --> 01:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
are such that you'll you'll get a
 
01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:44.709 align:start position:0%
are such that you'll you'll get a
certain

01:19:44.709 --> 01:19:44.719 align:start position:0%
certain
 
01:19:48.350 --> 01:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
pay increase over your career and if you
 
01:19:50.689 --> 01:19:50.699 align:start position:0%
suddenly jerk up the last few years your
 
01:19:53.030 --> 01:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
pension is increased but the payments
 
01:19:55.729 --> 01:19:55.739 align:start position:0%
into the system aren't
 
01:19:58.910 --> 01:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
they they're
 
01:20:01.010 --> 01:20:01.020 align:start position:0%
nope nope they're definitely a fair
 
01:20:02.630 --> 01:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
point it just had some other thoughts
 
01:20:04.910 --> 01:20:04.920 align:start position:0%
too actually I had some uh
 
01:20:06.470 --> 01:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
some thoughts written down I'll pass
 
01:20:08.510 --> 01:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
them around so might be easier people
 
01:20:11.689 --> 01:20:11.699 align:start position:0%
want to okay take a look anyways
 
01:20:11.699 --> 01:20:12.830 align:start position:0%
want to okay take a look anyways
um

01:20:12.830 --> 01:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:15.830 --> 01:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
the colas I know we've already um talked
 
01:20:18.169 --> 01:20:18.179 align:start position:0%
about um actually if anybody I have some
 
01:20:20.270 --> 01:20:20.280 align:start position:0%
extra comparisons to other other states
 
01:20:21.830 --> 01:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
for for that and for some other things
 
01:20:23.209 --> 01:20:23.219 align:start position:0%
that people wanted I have those over
 
01:20:24.169 --> 01:20:24.179 align:start position:0%
here people wanted more information
 
01:20:26.090 --> 01:20:26.100 align:start position:0%
about that but again just some other
 
01:20:28.729 --> 01:20:28.739 align:start position:0%
just kind of brainstorming ideas if you
 
01:20:28.739 --> 01:20:30.050 align:start position:0%
just kind of brainstorming ideas if you
will

01:20:30.050 --> 01:20:30.060 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:20:31.910 --> 01:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
um you know just highlight here a couple
 
01:20:35.209 --> 01:20:35.219 align:start position:0%
of not just reading the page but um more
 
01:20:36.950 --> 01:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
for more for our group looking into
 
01:20:40.189 --> 01:20:40.199 align:start position:0%
we'll expand the uh eligibility for to
 
01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
um support staff and I see a real
 
01:20:44.030 --> 01:20:44.040 align:start position:0%
benefit in that because then that way
 
01:20:46.310 --> 01:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
there will be more employees actually
 
01:20:48.169 --> 01:20:48.179 align:start position:0%
paying into the system so kind of
 
01:20:50.510 --> 01:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
referring to your last comment about the
 
01:20:52.130 --> 01:20:52.140 align:start position:0%
concern about not paying into the system
 
01:20:54.290 --> 01:20:54.300 align:start position:0%
which is a fair point on your part so
 
01:20:55.970 --> 01:20:55.980 align:start position:0%
you'd actually increase the amount of
 
01:20:57.649 --> 01:20:57.659 align:start position:0%
people that are actually paying in the
 
01:20:59.930 --> 01:20:59.940 align:start position:0%
system so naturally there'll be more
 
01:21:01.250 --> 01:21:01.260 align:start position:0%
people that will be eligible for some
 
01:21:02.870 --> 01:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
kind of benefit as well I know but again
 
01:21:04.729 --> 01:21:04.739 align:start position:0%
I think the more people that actually
 
01:21:06.470 --> 01:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
pay into the system I think would make
 
01:21:08.450 --> 01:21:08.460 align:start position:0%
it a healthier system so just one
 
01:21:10.970 --> 01:21:10.980 align:start position:0%
thought one thought there
 
01:21:10.980 --> 01:21:11.570 align:start position:0%
thought one thought there
um

01:21:11.570 --> 01:21:11.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:13.910 --> 01:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
just looking at the benefit calculations
 
01:21:16.430 --> 01:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
again going referring back to 2011 I
 
01:21:18.850 --> 01:21:18.860 align:start position:0%
know that it was a change from the
 
01:21:21.530 --> 01:21:21.540 align:start position:0%
highest three to the highest some five
 
01:21:24.530 --> 01:21:24.540 align:start position:0%
for um for um both tiers so it would be
 
01:21:26.149 --> 01:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
nice to be able to again for attraction
 
01:21:27.649 --> 01:21:27.659 align:start position:0%
and retention it would be nice to be
 
01:21:29.750 --> 01:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
able to again bring that down to the
 
01:21:31.910 --> 01:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
highest um three
 
01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:32.510 align:start position:0%
highest um three
um

01:21:32.510 --> 01:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:34.310 --> 01:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
it would be something too that it would
 
01:21:36.050 --> 01:21:36.060 align:start position:0%
be you know it would not be an immediate
 
01:21:37.490 --> 01:21:37.500 align:start position:0%
Spike if you will but it'll be something
 
01:21:39.649 --> 01:21:39.659 align:start position:0%
that could be prepared for so you know
 
01:21:41.390 --> 01:21:41.400 align:start position:0%
kind of like you know factor in over uh
 
01:21:43.850 --> 01:21:43.860 align:start position:0%
several amount of years
 
01:21:46.729 --> 01:21:46.739 align:start position:0%
um potentially looking to change the uh
 
01:21:48.470 --> 01:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
that I know our vesting period right now
 
01:21:50.570 --> 01:21:50.580 align:start position:0%
is 10 years so
 
01:21:52.010 --> 01:21:52.020 align:start position:0%
um competing states like Vermont and
 
01:21:53.510 --> 01:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
Maine for instance and again I have that
 
01:21:56.090 --> 01:21:56.100 align:start position:0%
more in my other things over here they
 
01:21:58.850 --> 01:21:58.860 align:start position:0%
actually have um it being five years and
 
01:22:00.290 --> 01:22:00.300 align:start position:0%
I know it was mentioned by someone I
 
01:22:02.810 --> 01:22:02.820 align:start position:0%
pardon me I forget who but uh there's a
 
01:22:04.490 --> 01:22:04.500 align:start position:0%
real concern about losing our Public
 
01:22:04.500 --> 01:22:05.630 align:start position:0%
real concern about losing our Public
Service

01:22:05.630 --> 01:22:05.640 align:start position:0%
Service
 
01:22:08.330 --> 01:22:08.340 align:start position:0%
um folks to other states so I think
 
01:22:12.350 --> 01:22:12.360 align:start position:0%
bringing in line our system to more of
 
01:22:14.870 --> 01:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
the benefits offered by other states is
 
01:22:15.709 --> 01:22:15.719 align:start position:0%
something that we should definitely
 
01:22:17.209 --> 01:22:17.219 align:start position:0%
consider because uh we definitely don't
 
01:22:19.310 --> 01:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
want to lose our police flyer teachers
 
01:22:21.649 --> 01:22:21.659 align:start position:0%
whatever else to other um States because
 
01:22:23.030 --> 01:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
I mean you know they're not going out to
 
01:22:24.649 --> 01:22:24.659 align:start position:0%
California person but I mean you could
 
01:22:26.450 --> 01:22:26.460 align:start position:0%
definitely see someone moving to mass or
 
01:22:26.460 --> 01:22:27.950 align:start position:0%
definitely see someone moving to mass or
Vermont

01:22:27.950 --> 01:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
Vermont
 
01:22:29.390 --> 01:22:29.400 align:start position:0%
if you will if it's going to be that
 
01:22:30.890 --> 01:22:30.900 align:start position:0%
much of a difference
 
01:22:33.290 --> 01:22:33.300 align:start position:0%
and then the last thing I think I I
 
01:22:34.790 --> 01:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
think I already mentioned just like the
 
01:22:37.370 --> 01:22:37.380 align:start position:0%
additional longevity payments I think I
 
01:22:39.229 --> 01:22:39.239 align:start position:0%
already mentioned that you'll just again
 
01:22:41.330 --> 01:22:41.340 align:start position:0%
some some thoughts and one thing that's
 
01:22:42.770 --> 01:22:42.780 align:start position:0%
not on here that I'll just kind of throw
 
01:22:45.110 --> 01:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
in just sometimes thoughts kind of enter
 
01:22:46.610 --> 01:22:46.620 align:start position:0%
the head if you will
 
01:22:49.970 --> 01:22:49.980 align:start position:0%
um going back to the increase whereas I
 
01:22:52.550 --> 01:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
know uh Mr Carlin who was talking
 
01:22:54.890 --> 01:22:54.900 align:start position:0%
um mentioned how the payments going from
 
01:22:56.930 --> 01:22:56.940 align:start position:0%
um up two percent for everybody else I
 
01:22:56.940 --> 01:22:57.770 align:start position:0%
um up two percent for everybody else I
mean

01:22:57.770 --> 01:22:57.780 align:start position:0%
mean
 
01:22:59.990 --> 01:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
employees have been now paying that
 
01:23:02.030 --> 01:23:02.040 align:start position:0%
extra two percent now for the last 12
 
01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:03.169 align:start position:0%
extra two percent now for the last 12
years

01:23:03.169 --> 01:23:03.179 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:23:05.270 --> 01:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
so if you will so what are some things
 
01:23:06.590 --> 01:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
if you will whether it be like
 
01:23:09.110 --> 01:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
pre-funding a cola whether it be either
 
01:23:11.990 --> 01:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
in pre-funding a medical
 
01:23:13.850 --> 01:23:13.860 align:start position:0%
um payment I know a medical subsidy
 
01:23:16.070 --> 01:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
payment that we had several years ago so
 
01:23:17.570 --> 01:23:17.580 align:start position:0%
knowing that those things are kind of
 
01:23:19.729 --> 01:23:19.739 align:start position:0%
have already been pre-funded for quite
 
01:23:21.649 --> 01:23:21.659 align:start position:0%
some time so therefore the money would
 
01:23:24.169 --> 01:23:24.179 align:start position:0%
already be in there and at least that
 
01:23:26.090 --> 01:23:26.100 align:start position:0%
way to the employee would actually be
 
01:23:28.310 --> 01:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
getting something extra for that two
 
01:23:29.750 --> 01:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
percent that they've been paying in I
 
01:23:31.610 --> 01:23:31.620 align:start position:0%
think that would be a really nice way to
 
01:23:34.430 --> 01:23:34.440 align:start position:0%
look at um attraction and attention of
 
01:23:37.610 --> 01:23:37.620 align:start position:0%
um our valuable set employees that's all
 
01:23:40.790 --> 01:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
I had on that okay thank you
 
01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:42.229 align:start position:0%
I had on that okay thank you
senator

01:23:42.229 --> 01:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
senator
 
01:23:46.669 --> 01:23:46.679 align:start position:0%
if I could respond to that um
 
01:23:49.970 --> 01:23:49.980 align:start position:0%
in terms of the the first issue brought
 
01:23:52.850 --> 01:23:52.860 align:start position:0%
up about the the colas um
 
01:23:56.510 --> 01:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
and I I wondered um you know the this
 
01:23:58.669 --> 01:23:58.679 align:start position:0%
Prospect here of saying if we have a
 
01:24:00.229 --> 01:24:00.239 align:start position:0%
coal account
 
01:24:02.030 --> 01:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
and understanding the problem with the
 
01:24:04.850 --> 01:24:04.860 align:start position:0%
funding of colas that would we be able
 
01:24:07.610 --> 01:24:07.620 align:start position:0%
to look at in a sense a proposal that
 
01:24:10.130 --> 01:24:10.140 align:start position:0%
kind of holds at some point in the
 
01:24:12.290 --> 01:24:12.300 align:start position:0%
future time kind of level what the
 
01:24:13.669 --> 01:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
contributions are from the
 
01:24:15.950 --> 01:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities I suppose
 
01:24:18.709 --> 01:24:18.719 align:start position:0%
so that instead of the decline that
 
01:24:21.050 --> 01:24:21.060 align:start position:0%
funding might go into this account
 
01:24:23.390 --> 01:24:23.400 align:start position:0%
and I I didn't know if you know Mr
 
01:24:25.310 --> 01:24:25.320 align:start position:0%
Carlin might be able to comment as to
 
01:24:27.950 --> 01:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
given what you said about the slowness
 
01:24:30.530 --> 01:24:30.540 align:start position:0%
of any eventual decline if you have any
 
01:24:31.850 --> 01:24:31.860 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
01:24:33.470 --> 01:24:33.480 align:start position:0%
you know just off the cuff thoughts
 
01:24:46.610 --> 01:24:46.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:48.649 --> 01:24:48.659 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean if you see the proposal here
 
01:24:50.930 --> 01:24:50.940 align:start position:0%
in one one way I read it is to say that
 
01:24:53.870 --> 01:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
at a future point in time
 
01:24:56.870 --> 01:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
that if we set up a cola account
 
01:25:00.770 --> 01:25:00.780 align:start position:0%
that as the amount as the unfunded
 
01:25:03.410 --> 01:25:03.420 align:start position:0%
reliability starts to decline and
 
01:25:05.689 --> 01:25:05.699 align:start position:0%
therefore the
 
01:25:07.970 --> 01:25:07.980 align:start position:0%
employer contribution rate for that
 
01:25:11.590 --> 01:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
unfined liability starts to decline then
 
01:25:14.090 --> 01:25:14.100 align:start position:0%
would that
 
01:25:17.510 --> 01:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
employer contribution if it were held
 
01:25:19.910 --> 01:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
steady or a part of it was the decline
 
01:25:21.770 --> 01:25:21.780 align:start position:0%
were slowed so that that funding might
 
01:25:23.870 --> 01:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
go into this special account I mean
 
01:25:25.729 --> 01:25:25.739 align:start position:0%
isn't that more or less what your you
 
01:25:26.990 --> 01:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
know kind of implication would just
 
01:25:29.330 --> 01:25:29.340 align:start position:0%
suggest you Mr Fuller something along
 
01:25:31.010 --> 01:25:31.020 align:start position:0%
that line something along those lines
 
01:25:32.030 --> 01:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
yeah I think you definitely have the
 
01:25:35.209 --> 01:25:35.219 align:start position:0%
idea there okay thank you
 
01:25:38.570 --> 01:25:38.580 align:start position:0%
if if uh you know the the the the real
 
01:25:40.550 --> 01:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
world problem right now is the unfunded
 
01:25:43.130 --> 01:25:43.140 align:start position:0%
percentage is so high that you know you
 
01:25:46.370 --> 01:25:46.380 align:start position:0%
know and if we waited until 20 alleged
 
01:25:48.229 --> 01:25:48.239 align:start position:0%
the legislature you know collectively we
 
01:25:50.570 --> 01:25:50.580 align:start position:0%
the state waited till 2040 there's a
 
01:25:52.130 --> 01:25:52.140 align:start position:0%
generation of people who are working now
 
01:25:55.310 --> 01:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
who wouldn't benefit from that if if the
 
01:25:58.850 --> 01:25:58.860 align:start position:0%
rates were lower and there was a
 
01:26:00.830 --> 01:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
legislation you know there was a law
 
01:26:03.169 --> 01:26:03.179 align:start position:0%
pass that
 
01:26:05.270 --> 01:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
um you know Porter they have the
 
01:26:07.550 --> 01:26:07.560 align:start position:0%
employers pay the actuarily determined
 
01:26:11.330 --> 01:26:11.340 align:start position:0%
contribution rate plus X you know with X
 
01:26:13.550 --> 01:26:13.560 align:start position:0%
going into an account dedicated towards
 
01:26:17.030 --> 01:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
colas I mean you it you know it could
 
01:26:19.430 --> 01:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
work in theory that the the issue too
 
01:26:21.669 --> 01:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
then is if you start that in you know
 
01:26:26.090 --> 01:26:26.100 align:start position:0%
2024 or 2044 do people who were working
 
01:26:27.890 --> 01:26:27.900 align:start position:0%
before that date available for those
 
01:26:29.689 --> 01:26:29.699 align:start position:0%
callers or are they left out in the cold
 
01:26:31.310 --> 01:26:31.320 align:start position:0%
you know there's there's a there's a lot
 
01:26:33.709 --> 01:26:33.719 align:start position:0%
of practical inflammation implications
 
01:26:36.169 --> 01:26:36.179 align:start position:0%
but the in the short term it's just it's
 
01:26:37.970 --> 01:26:37.980 align:start position:0%
you know the you know what the rates
 
01:26:40.669 --> 01:26:40.679 align:start position:0%
such as they are now and that's you know
 
01:26:42.470 --> 01:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
that you know that's a policy decision
 
01:26:44.570 --> 01:26:44.580 align:start position:0%
to you to
 
01:26:47.149 --> 01:26:47.159 align:start position:0%
put in a you know actually determine
 
01:26:49.729 --> 01:26:49.739 align:start position:0%
rate plus X you know you know that that
 
01:26:52.310 --> 01:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
becomes a special account you know we it
 
01:26:53.510 --> 01:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
was a term
 
01:26:55.729 --> 01:26:55.739 align:start position:0%
um you refer to as the special account
 
01:26:57.530 --> 01:26:57.540 align:start position:0%
there used to be such an account and it
 
01:26:59.090 --> 01:26:59.100 align:start position:0%
didn't work that way it worked kind of
 
01:27:00.830 --> 01:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
in the opposite
 
01:27:02.830 --> 01:27:02.840 align:start position:0%
um where it essentially skimmed off
 
01:27:06.110 --> 01:27:06.120 align:start position:0%
investment earnings over some percentage
 
01:27:08.270 --> 01:27:08.280 align:start position:0%
of the assumed rate of return and put it
 
01:27:10.129 --> 01:27:10.139 align:start position:0%
over in this pocket and said coal is a
 
01:27:13.370 --> 01:27:13.380 align:start position:0%
medical subsidy which is great if you're
 
01:27:14.990 --> 01:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
always making more than you think you're
 
01:27:16.729 --> 01:27:16.739 align:start position:0%
gonna make which means probably means
 
01:27:18.410 --> 01:27:18.420 align:start position:0%
you're you're not is too low to begin
 
01:27:21.050 --> 01:27:21.060 align:start position:0%
with but you know but what happens is if
 
01:27:23.090 --> 01:27:23.100 align:start position:0%
you have a down year or a negative
 
01:27:25.430 --> 01:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
return you have no money to backfill it
 
01:27:26.930 --> 01:27:26.940 align:start position:0%
on the pension side because this money
 
01:27:29.030 --> 01:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
money is Promised for something else but
 
01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:29.990 align:start position:0%
money is Promised for something else but
you're

01:27:29.990 --> 01:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
you're
 
01:27:32.990 --> 01:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
your proposal as I understand it would
 
01:27:35.330 --> 01:27:35.340 align:start position:0%
would not do that it would be over and
 
01:27:37.010 --> 01:27:37.020 align:start position:0%
above so it's not going to shortchange
 
01:27:39.590 --> 01:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
the pension benefit side of the the
 
01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:41.090 align:start position:0%
the pension benefit side of the the
trust

01:27:41.090 --> 01:27:41.100 align:start position:0%
trust
 
01:27:44.270 --> 01:27:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:46.070 --> 01:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
Mr real
 
01:27:47.870 --> 01:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair well we still
 
01:27:50.209 --> 01:27:50.219 align:start position:0%
have Mr Carlin at the mic uh one of the
 
01:27:52.970 --> 01:27:52.980 align:start position:0%
things that Mr filler had mentioned was
 
01:27:55.550 --> 01:27:55.560 align:start position:0%
the vesting period
 
01:27:57.470 --> 01:27:57.480 align:start position:0%
Mr Carlin
 
01:28:00.530 --> 01:28:00.540 align:start position:0%
I the way I understand it in in current
 
01:28:00.540 --> 01:28:01.970 align:start position:0%
I the way I understand it in in current
statue

01:28:01.970 --> 01:28:01.980 align:start position:0%
statue
 
01:28:04.669 --> 01:28:04.679 align:start position:0%
it speaks of vesting but is there an
 
01:28:06.770 --> 01:28:06.780 align:start position:0%
actual definition in place for what
 
01:28:09.290 --> 01:28:09.300 align:start position:0%
vesting is now
 
01:28:12.050 --> 01:28:12.060 align:start position:0%
term wise
 
01:28:14.390 --> 01:28:14.400 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm not I'm not entirely sure
 
01:28:17.689 --> 01:28:17.699 align:start position:0%
because because it was by reference
 
01:28:19.669 --> 01:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
um you know there's a type of retirement
 
01:28:21.410 --> 01:28:21.420 align:start position:0%
benefit called vested deferred
 
01:28:23.750 --> 01:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
retirement which says that if you have
 
01:28:25.669 --> 01:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
10 years of service and you terminate
 
01:28:27.169 --> 01:28:27.179 align:start position:0%
your employment you can come back and
 
01:28:28.910 --> 01:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
collect their retirement benefit based
 
01:28:31.970 --> 01:28:31.980 align:start position:0%
on those 10 years uh I'm I I'm actually
 
01:28:35.209 --> 01:28:35.219 align:start position:0%
not sure we may or may not have added a
 
01:28:37.610 --> 01:28:37.620 align:start position:0%
term in 100 A1 for vesting
 
01:28:38.870 --> 01:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
um I don't have the law book in front of
 
01:28:41.270 --> 01:28:41.280 align:start position:0%
me but you know that that was always the
 
01:28:44.870 --> 01:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
you know it wasn't a reach I mean it was
 
01:28:46.550 --> 01:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
you know legally you know there was a
 
01:28:48.290 --> 01:28:48.300 align:start position:0%
solid ground to consider vesting for 10
 
01:28:52.729 --> 01:28:52.739 align:start position:0%
years but New Hampshire at 10 years many
 
01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
states even had three year investing and
 
01:28:56.629 --> 01:28:56.639 align:start position:0%
they've increased it to five ten is
 
01:28:58.310 --> 01:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
still on the high side nationally for
 
01:29:00.169 --> 01:29:00.179 align:start position:0%
investing period
 
01:29:03.050 --> 01:29:03.060 align:start position:0%
great thank you if we could Madam chair
 
01:29:04.490 --> 01:29:04.500 align:start position:0%
I'd like to add that to the the
 
01:29:06.550 --> 01:29:06.560 align:start position:0%
conversations for the future
 
01:29:10.070 --> 01:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
just defining what our vesting period
 
01:29:13.550 --> 01:29:13.560 align:start position:0%
should be thank you and if I may well
 
01:29:15.410 --> 01:29:15.420 align:start position:0%
I'm still sitting here just for the sake
 
01:29:15.420 --> 01:29:16.250 align:start position:0%
I'm still sitting here just for the sake
of

01:29:16.250 --> 01:29:16.260 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:29:18.229 --> 01:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
folks who haven't been living in this
 
01:29:20.090 --> 01:29:20.100 align:start position:0%
when we talk about vesting that means
 
01:29:21.410 --> 01:29:21.420 align:start position:0%
you've earned a right to a future
 
01:29:23.149 --> 01:29:23.159 align:start position:0%
pension benefit it doesn't mean you can
 
01:29:25.370 --> 01:29:25.380 align:start position:0%
collect you know five years I mean if
 
01:29:27.169 --> 01:29:27.179 align:start position:0%
you're 28 years old and you hit your
 
01:29:29.390 --> 01:29:29.400 align:start position:0%
five years you still have to be a
 
01:29:31.010 --> 01:29:31.020 align:start position:0%
certain age to collect your benefit it's
 
01:29:33.070 --> 01:29:33.080 align:start position:0%
just when you become eligible for that
 
01:29:35.750 --> 01:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
ultimate benefit
 
01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:37.129 align:start position:0%
ultimate benefit
yes

01:29:37.129 --> 01:29:37.139 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:29:37.139 --> 01:29:37.870 align:start position:0%
yes
um

01:29:37.870 --> 01:29:37.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:41.270 --> 01:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
before you leave uh what
 
01:29:43.669 --> 01:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
do you expect that we'll have the
 
01:29:45.830 --> 01:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
results back from the actuaries by next
 
01:29:49.310 --> 01:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
week thank you madam chair I wanted to
 
01:29:51.649 --> 01:29:51.659 align:start position:0%
try to work that in my first go around
 
01:29:54.050 --> 01:29:54.060 align:start position:0%
up here we sent that off to the actuary
 
01:29:56.149 --> 01:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
this week and
 
01:29:59.270 --> 01:29:59.280 align:start position:0%
um We believe We will have the analysis
 
01:30:01.310 --> 01:30:01.320 align:start position:0%
of those two bills prior to the meeting
 
01:30:04.490 --> 01:30:04.500 align:start position:0%
in two weeks uh nine seven so uh when
 
01:30:06.290 --> 01:30:06.300 align:start position:0%
once we have them and look them over
 
01:30:08.030 --> 01:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
we'll get them over to you to distribute
 
01:30:09.649 --> 01:30:09.659 align:start position:0%
and then we can
 
01:30:11.689 --> 01:30:11.699 align:start position:0%
um you know be on hand to discuss
 
01:30:11.699 --> 01:30:17.149 align:start position:0%
um you know be on hand to discuss
okay

01:30:17.149 --> 01:30:17.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:19.430 --> 01:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
I just want to say that the discussion
 
01:30:22.250 --> 01:30:22.260 align:start position:0%
with regards to keeping the employer's
 
01:30:25.370 --> 01:30:25.380 align:start position:0%
share going is of concern to me because
 
01:30:27.530 --> 01:30:27.540 align:start position:0%
as a town official
 
01:30:30.169 --> 01:30:30.179 align:start position:0%
I know that we obviously have to pay
 
01:30:33.050 --> 01:30:33.060 align:start position:0%
towards the U hey Al and that was what
 
01:30:35.390 --> 01:30:35.400 align:start position:0%
that extra money was for it was not for
 
01:30:38.990 --> 01:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
funding anything else but that ual so I
 
01:30:40.490 --> 01:30:40.500 align:start position:0%
have concerns about the discussion about
 
01:30:43.189 --> 01:30:43.199 align:start position:0%
leaving that the employer's share flat
 
01:30:44.930 --> 01:30:44.940 align:start position:0%
so that we continue to pay now it's
 
01:30:46.790 --> 01:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
going to be for Cola
 
01:30:46.800 --> 01:30:50.290 align:start position:0%
going to be for Cola
mm-hmm

01:30:50.290 --> 01:30:50.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:53.030 --> 01:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
that's that's a very important political
 
01:30:55.729 --> 01:30:55.739 align:start position:0%
point that if we choose to create and
 
01:30:58.729 --> 01:30:58.739 align:start position:0%
fund a cola who has the fun of paying
 
01:30:59.689 --> 01:30:59.699 align:start position:0%
for it
 
01:31:02.870 --> 01:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
the employer or the employees or both Mr
 
01:31:06.110 --> 01:31:06.120 align:start position:0%
Martin thank you madam chair
 
01:31:10.610 --> 01:31:10.620 align:start position:0%
um I like to ask if we could get
 
01:31:14.629 --> 01:31:14.639 align:start position:0%
the the value of how much have we
 
01:31:17.149 --> 01:31:17.159 align:start position:0%
collected for the two percent including
 
01:31:20.570 --> 01:31:20.580 align:start position:0%
Investments since 2011.
 
01:31:23.689 --> 01:31:23.699 align:start position:0%
and I think that number may be readily
 
01:31:26.810 --> 01:31:26.820 align:start position:0%
available and I'll say why
 
01:31:29.870 --> 01:31:29.880 align:start position:0%
as you heard Senator Bradley said that
 
01:31:33.530 --> 01:31:33.540 align:start position:0%
whenever we propose a bill they do a
 
01:31:38.450 --> 01:31:38.460 align:start position:0%
estimation cost so in 2011 there was an
 
01:31:42.350 --> 01:31:42.360 align:start position:0%
article by the Portsmouth Herald that
 
01:31:45.470 --> 01:31:45.480 align:start position:0%
quoted this honorable Senator that he
 
01:31:45.480 --> 01:31:46.850 align:start position:0%
quoted this honorable Senator that he
said

01:31:46.850 --> 01:31:46.860 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:31:50.149 --> 01:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
and uh that the estimated
 
01:31:53.689 --> 01:31:53.699 align:start position:0%
the estimated gain would be 750 million
 
01:31:53.699 --> 01:31:54.890 align:start position:0%
the estimated gain would be 750 million
dollars

01:31:54.890 --> 01:31:54.900 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:31:58.970 --> 01:31:58.980 align:start position:0%
and it's on that Arc in 2011. in in The
 
01:31:58.980 --> 01:32:00.830 align:start position:0%
and it's on that Arc in 2011. in in The
Herald

01:32:00.830 --> 01:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
Herald
 
01:32:05.390 --> 01:32:05.400 align:start position:0%
Charles McMahon May 18 2011. now the
 
01:32:08.330 --> 01:32:08.340 align:start position:0%
economy did a lot better than we first
 
01:32:08.340 --> 01:32:09.709 align:start position:0%
economy did a lot better than we first
estimated

01:32:09.709 --> 01:32:09.719 align:start position:0%
estimated
 
01:32:11.930 --> 01:32:11.940 align:start position:0%
so that number might be close to a
 
01:32:13.430 --> 01:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
billion dollars
 
01:32:15.950 --> 01:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
as you see the retirement system had a
 
01:32:18.110 --> 01:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
real hard time 2007 and eight because we
 
01:32:21.050 --> 01:32:21.060 align:start position:0%
had a bear Market the cost of the value
 
01:32:25.189 --> 01:32:25.199 align:start position:0%
of SP 500 would declined to 50 so we
 
01:32:28.310 --> 01:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
made a lot of drastic changes and fixes
 
01:32:30.470 --> 01:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
temper a permanent fix to temporary
 
01:32:32.930 --> 01:32:32.940 align:start position:0%
problem the economy rebounds after that
 
01:32:34.910 --> 01:32:34.920 align:start position:0%
and the retirement system if you looked
 
01:32:36.470 --> 01:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
at it on this chart that we received
 
01:32:38.870 --> 01:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
from the retirement system is continuing
 
01:32:42.649 --> 01:32:42.659 align:start position:0%
to grow from 4 6 7 8 9 10 billion so
 
01:32:45.830 --> 01:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
we're over 11 billion now regardless of
 
01:32:47.510 --> 01:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
the fact that some of our investment
 
01:32:49.550 --> 01:32:49.560 align:start position:0%
returns were not that great they do a
 
01:32:53.570 --> 01:32:53.580 align:start position:0%
great job at this fantastic job but the
 
01:32:55.970 --> 01:32:55.980 align:start position:0%
Investments are very unpredictable we
 
01:33:00.350 --> 01:33:00.360 align:start position:0%
had a great year in 2001 at 21 bed 2022
 
01:33:02.810 --> 01:33:02.820 align:start position:0%
minus six the three times continue to do
 
01:33:05.270 --> 01:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
that and that's basically when you
 
01:33:07.610 --> 01:33:07.620 align:start position:0%
collect two percent extra with no extra
 
01:33:09.950 --> 01:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
benefits and you invest that money and
 
01:33:13.070 --> 01:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
we've been doing this for since 2011 a
 
01:33:16.610 --> 01:33:16.620 align:start position:0%
good 12 years so we had that study back
 
01:33:16.620 --> 01:33:17.330 align:start position:0%
good 12 years so we had that study back
then

01:33:17.330 --> 01:33:17.340 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:33:20.629 --> 01:33:20.639 align:start position:0%
we had to had otherwise like the senator
 
01:33:23.149 --> 01:33:23.159 align:start position:0%
said we wouldn't have had that bill so
 
01:33:26.629 --> 01:33:26.639 align:start position:0%
if we could get that to the group so we
 
01:33:29.090 --> 01:33:29.100 align:start position:0%
can take a look at what number is that
 
01:33:32.450 --> 01:33:32.460 align:start position:0%
we collected in addition when we start
 
01:33:33.890 --> 01:33:33.900 align:start position:0%
collecting two percent more from
 
01:33:36.530 --> 01:33:36.540 align:start position:0%
everybody for 12 years in a row I think
 
01:33:39.470 --> 01:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:49.610 --> 01:33:49.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:51.590 --> 01:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
01:33:54.169 --> 01:33:54.179 align:start position:0%
all right it seems like we've run out of
 
01:33:54.179 --> 01:33:55.370 align:start position:0%
all right it seems like we've run out of
inspiration

01:33:55.370 --> 01:33:55.380 align:start position:0%
inspiration
 
01:33:58.729 --> 01:33:58.739 align:start position:0%
uh if we don't have the Actuarial data
 
01:34:01.790 --> 01:34:01.800 align:start position:0%
on for two weeks I'm going to suggest we
 
01:34:06.110 --> 01:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
cancel next week's meeting and re we
 
01:34:07.810 --> 01:34:07.820 align:start position:0%
meet in two weeks
 
01:34:10.729 --> 01:34:10.739 align:start position:0%
so that we can
 
01:34:10.739 --> 01:34:14.149 align:start position:0%
so that we can
um

01:34:14.149 --> 01:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:16.250 --> 01:34:16.260 align:start position:0%
look at the numbers for this the short
 
01:34:17.689 --> 01:34:17.699 align:start position:0%
term fix
 
01:34:20.810 --> 01:34:20.820 align:start position:0%
and I and I thank you Mr Fuller for for
 
01:34:27.229 --> 01:34:27.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:27.239 --> 01:34:28.430 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:34:28.430 --> 01:34:28.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:30.950 --> 01:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
I think that we might want to have
 
01:34:34.270 --> 01:34:34.280 align:start position:0%
another discussion on on
 
01:34:37.910 --> 01:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
call it the the question really is not
 
01:34:40.810 --> 01:34:40.820 align:start position:0%
whether we want to give them it's
 
01:34:44.750 --> 01:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
how do we pay for them and who pays
 
01:34:47.750 --> 01:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
so but which is an important discussion
 
01:34:49.550 --> 01:34:49.560 align:start position:0%
so we'll do that
 
01:34:51.050 --> 01:34:51.060 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:34:54.470 --> 01:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
yes some question Madam chair so I I
 
01:34:56.570 --> 01:34:56.580 align:start position:0%
agree I think that'd be a good idea
 
01:34:58.129 --> 01:34:58.139 align:start position:0%
um I really like the idea of canceling
 
01:35:01.729 --> 01:35:01.739 align:start position:0%
the meeting too by the way but um
 
01:35:03.350 --> 01:35:03.360 align:start position:0%
um I I just wondered you know what your
 
01:35:04.910 --> 01:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
kind of thoughts were yes we've
 
01:35:06.950 --> 01:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
generated a lot of ideas I think Cole
 
01:35:11.149 --> 01:35:11.159 align:start position:0%
was obviously rise up up there but um
 
01:35:12.709 --> 01:35:12.719 align:start position:0%
you know I just wondered what you
 
01:35:14.750 --> 01:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
thought would be helpful how we think
 
01:35:16.070 --> 01:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
about all the things that have come up
 
01:35:18.110 --> 01:35:18.120 align:start position:0%
today for our meetings moving forward I
 
01:35:21.290 --> 01:35:21.300 align:start position:0%
think summer ones we may actually want
 
01:35:22.910 --> 01:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
to make a recommendation on some
 
01:35:24.770 --> 01:35:24.780 align:start position:0%
probably don't and of course any
 
01:35:26.990 --> 01:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
legislator can put in a bill
 
01:35:28.490 --> 01:35:28.500 align:start position:0%
um so I just wonder what you thought
 
01:35:30.229 --> 01:35:30.239 align:start position:0%
would be how you thought it's going to
 
01:35:31.370 --> 01:35:31.380 align:start position:0%
be useful
 
01:35:33.590 --> 01:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
plus to go through this list or maybe we
 
01:35:35.149 --> 01:35:35.159 align:start position:0%
can talk about it when we next meet but
 
01:35:37.189 --> 01:35:37.199 align:start position:0%
I think we ought to talk we ought to
 
01:35:40.070 --> 01:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
think about it and talk to talk to our
 
01:35:42.229 --> 01:35:42.239 align:start position:0%
constituents and see what other issues
 
01:35:45.649 --> 01:35:45.659 align:start position:0%
we might want to do and
 
01:35:45.659 --> 01:35:46.790 align:start position:0%
we might want to do and
um

01:35:46.790 --> 01:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:49.010 --> 01:35:49.020 align:start position:0%
and as I said we've got different ways
 
01:35:51.830 --> 01:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
to incorporate these ideas into into the
 
01:35:56.750 --> 01:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
law so it we should consider what kind
 
01:35:57.770 --> 01:35:57.780 align:start position:0%
of a
 
01:36:00.470 --> 01:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
of a bill would you want to submit and
 
01:36:02.330 --> 01:36:02.340 align:start position:0%
would it be
 
01:36:05.149 --> 01:36:05.159 align:start position:0%
something we'd want to vote on in the
 
01:36:07.370 --> 01:36:07.380 align:start position:0%
house or the senate in January or just
 
01:36:09.890 --> 01:36:09.900 align:start position:0%
introduce it then I mean that's we have
 
01:36:12.350 --> 01:36:12.360 align:start position:0%
we have options
 
01:36:14.689 --> 01:36:14.699 align:start position:0%
well and just if I may I mean kind of
 
01:36:16.129 --> 01:36:16.139 align:start position:0%
part of my point is to say that I think
 
01:36:18.290 --> 01:36:18.300 align:start position:0%
that what we end up making as
 
01:36:20.990 --> 01:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
recommendations from this body will
 
01:36:23.450 --> 01:36:23.460 align:start position:0%
influence that and also lend a certain
 
01:36:25.550 --> 01:36:25.560 align:start position:0%
weight that we have considered in a you
 
01:36:27.649 --> 01:36:27.659 align:start position:0%
know in the context of a broad-based
 
01:36:30.470 --> 01:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
commission what yeah are areas that it
 
01:36:31.850 --> 01:36:31.860 align:start position:0%
looks like there might be some
 
01:36:34.850 --> 01:36:34.860 align:start position:0%
opportunity to move forward form on a in
 
01:36:38.689 --> 01:36:38.699 align:start position:0%
a consensual basis so well that's uh
 
01:36:41.450 --> 01:36:41.460 align:start position:0%
we've got some some ideas we don't have
 
01:36:44.750 --> 01:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
a a firm plan that we could consider and
 
01:36:46.370 --> 01:36:46.380 align:start position:0%
vote on saying is this something because
 
01:36:47.990 --> 01:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
the commission as a whole wants to
 
01:36:49.970 --> 01:36:49.980 align:start position:0%
recommend so
 
01:36:55.250 --> 01:36:55.260 align:start position:0%
it's we all can work on on generating a
 
01:36:57.410 --> 01:36:57.420 align:start position:0%
a more solid plan that would be
 
01:36:59.930 --> 01:36:59.940 align:start position:0%
wonderful Mr real thank you madam chair
 
01:37:02.149 --> 01:37:02.159 align:start position:0%
uh one of the things I just want to draw
 
01:37:04.370 --> 01:37:04.380 align:start position:0%
further attention to and representative
 
01:37:06.290 --> 01:37:06.300 align:start position:0%
Leachman brought it up
 
01:37:06.300 --> 01:37:07.610 align:start position:0%
Leachman brought it up
um that

01:37:07.610 --> 01:37:07.620 align:start position:0%
um that
 
01:37:09.770 --> 01:37:09.780 align:start position:0%
that this commission was developed as an
 
01:37:14.149 --> 01:37:14.159 align:start position:0%
amendment to House Bill 436 which was
 
01:37:17.570 --> 01:37:17.580 align:start position:0%
um very defined in what its scope was
 
01:37:19.550 --> 01:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
now obviously the scope of the
 
01:37:21.770 --> 01:37:21.780 align:start position:0%
commission as written has expanded and
 
01:37:23.090 --> 01:37:23.100 align:start position:0%
that's great
 
01:37:25.370 --> 01:37:25.380 align:start position:0%
um I think a broader discussion on
 
01:37:28.610 --> 01:37:28.620 align:start position:0%
retirement benefits as a whole for
 
01:37:31.430 --> 01:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
everyone is warranted but I also don't
 
01:37:34.850 --> 01:37:34.860 align:start position:0%
want to shift Focus away from why this
 
01:37:38.510 --> 01:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
commission initially was established to
 
01:37:38.520 --> 01:37:39.830 align:start position:0%
commission initially was established to
to

01:37:39.830 --> 01:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:37:43.370 --> 01:37:43.380 align:start position:0%
fix or repair benefits loss from groups
 
01:37:46.490 --> 01:37:46.500 align:start position:0%
in 2011 so if we could just also keep
 
01:37:48.550 --> 01:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
that in mind that would be appreciated
 
01:37:50.990 --> 01:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm sure we're going to have at
 
01:37:54.290 --> 01:37:54.300 align:start position:0%
least two outputs one one short term and
 
01:37:56.330 --> 01:37:56.340 align:start position:0%
one longer term or maybe two or three
 
01:37:59.990 --> 01:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:02.450 --> 01:38:02.460 align:start position:0%
anyone else have a comment
 
01:38:04.430 --> 01:38:04.440 align:start position:0%
hey thank you all for coming we will
 
01:38:05.689 --> 01:38:05.699 align:start position:0%
take off
 
01:38:09.290 --> 01:38:09.300 align:start position:0%
next week and resume re-meet on the 7th
 
01:38:19.990 --> 01:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
