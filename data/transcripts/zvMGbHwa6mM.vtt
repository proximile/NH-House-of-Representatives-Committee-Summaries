00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
opens the committee of conference
 
00:00:06.869 --> 00:00:06.879 align:start position:0%
on house bill 187
 
00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:10.160 align:start position:0%
an act relative to the emergency powers
 
00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
of the commissioner of health and human
 
00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
services and relative to the membership
 
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 align:start position:0%
of the oversight committee
 
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:19.840 align:start position:0%
on health and human services and i think
 
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:20.550 align:start position:0%
on health and human services and i think
we

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:20.560 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:22.960 align:start position:0%
know that there's only two spots of
 
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:24.880 align:start position:0%
disagreement the rest of it is
 
00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
is pretty easy if you've got your side
 
00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 align:start position:0%
by side it's
 
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 align:start position:0%
lots of blank spaces so if you would
 
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 align:start position:0%
turn please to
 
00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:38.079 align:start position:0%
this has to do with the oversight
 
00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:39.910 align:start position:0%
this has to do with the oversight
committee

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
which i chair and my immediate
 
00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 align:start position:0%
and the only change that
 
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
i see is that
 
00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 align:start position:0%
line 7
 
00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
um when it came out of the house it
 
00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:02.079 align:start position:0%
asked for two members of the senate
 
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
and the senate amended it to three
 
00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
um lots of interest
 
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 align:start position:0%
we are interested senator sherman uh
 
00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 align:start position:0%
well it two is uh
 
00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
actually the original number was three
 
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 align:start position:0%
and it was dropped to
 
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
two in statute i think it was last year
 
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
yeah and so
 
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 align:start position:0%
i think this was partially at the
 
00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 align:start position:0%
request of the department partially
 
00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 align:start position:0%
requested senate because you know if you
 
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
put three on you might get one
 
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
that's just an attendance issue so it
 
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.069 align:start position:0%
would be
great

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:44.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 align:start position:0%
and i think when we were talking
 
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
you and i mr chairman about drafting in
 
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 align:start position:0%
the house
 
00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 align:start position:0%
i simply said i never had three ever
 
00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
so perhaps we could just put it at two
 
00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 align:start position:0%
because i was concerned about issues of
 
00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 align:start position:0%
a quorum
 
00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 align:start position:0%
but i'm no longer concerned about issues
 
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 align:start position:0%
of the quorum because
 
00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 align:start position:0%
the house can appoint alternates and if
 
00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 align:start position:0%
the house has alternates i can get five
 
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 align:start position:0%
people where you can get five people
 
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 align:start position:0%
into the room and that means that
 
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 align:start position:0%
we can to the limited extent the
 
00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 align:start position:0%
committee votes on anything so i
 
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 align:start position:0%
i think that going back to three of the
 
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
senate prefers it that way
 
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
makes sense to me outside i'm good with
 
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.670 align:start position:0%
makes sense to me outside i'm good with
this

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 align:start position:0%
yeah okay the only thing
 
00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 align:start position:0%
i could please the only thing i'd ask gm
 
00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
is whether there's a desire on the
 
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 align:start position:0%
senate side
 
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:41.509 align:start position:0%
senate side
to

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
we don't normally do that what we
 
00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 align:start position:0%
normally do is that if someone
 
00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 align:start position:0%
can't attend then the senate president
 
00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
will appoint a temporary replacement
 
00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
you know for that day and then right
 
00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 align:start position:0%
so the senate office usually takes care
 
00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
of it
 
00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
would that be considered legitimate even
 
00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 align:start position:0%
though it is
 
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
not going into the law here well the
 
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:06.869 align:start position:0%
not going into the law here well the
thing

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 align:start position:0%
is is that senate president is the
 
00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 align:start position:0%
person who gets to choose who the
 
00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 align:start position:0%
representatives are
 
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
right and as long as he signs it and
 
00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
says for this day that's my
 
00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:17.270 align:start position:0%
says for this day that's my
representative

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 align:start position:0%
it meets fully the law all right we had
 
00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 align:start position:0%
a senator missing
 
00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 align:start position:0%
uh last friday and no replacement had
 
00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.990 align:start position:0%
uh last friday and no replacement had
been

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:28.879 align:start position:0%
named so that just simply means the
 
00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:29.589 align:start position:0%
named so that just simply means the
senate

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:29.599 align:start position:0%
senate
 
00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 align:start position:0%
members of oversight would be would be
 
00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:34.159 align:start position:0%
reviewed in this procedure
 
00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
well what your last friday thing is is
 
00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.390 align:start position:0%
well what your last friday thing is is
that

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 align:start position:0%
either the senator that was supposed to
 
00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:42.159 align:start position:0%
be there didn't notify
 
00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879 align:start position:0%
the senate president's office or there
 
00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:46.390 align:start position:0%
the senate president's office or there
wasn't

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
wasn't
 
00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 align:start position:0%
uh sufficient things on the agenda that
 
00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
the senate president thought it was
 
00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:52.159 align:start position:0%
necessary to
 
00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
you know put a replacement in for that
 
00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
particular day it could be
 
00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 align:start position:0%
a complicated thing that you're going
 
00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
over and a
 
00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
new replacement really wouldn't have the
 
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
background so
 
00:04:04.149 --> 00:04:04.159 align:start position:0%
you know why would you do that if
 
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 align:start position:0%
there's any number of reasons i think
 
00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
this had to
 
00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 align:start position:0%
in fact it had to do with uh an airline
 
00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
ticket that suddenly got moved up from
 
00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 align:start position:0%
four in the afternoon to ten in the
 
00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 align:start position:0%
morning and i think that is the reason
 
00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:17.749 align:start position:0%
morning and i think that is the reason
yeah

00:04:17.749 --> 00:04:17.759 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
and if there's if there isn't sufficient
 
00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 align:start position:0%
time to do it then
 
00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 align:start position:0%
certainly the senate president can't do
 
00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
that sure senator sherman
 
00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
so if they let the senate president know
 
00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
they can't be there for whatever reason
 
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee is an example of
 
00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 align:start position:0%
where we do that often
 
00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 align:start position:0%
and depending upon the contents of the
 
00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.150 align:start position:0%
and depending upon the contents of the
meeting

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:01.039 align:start position:0%
if there is someone maybe we just want
 
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
to substitute one
 
00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
one senator for another because of that
 
00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.350 align:start position:0%
one senator for another because of that
content

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 align:start position:0%
content
 
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 align:start position:0%
okay or if there is somebody absent
 
00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
president will and i would just note
 
00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:13.039 align:start position:0%
that senate practicing president than if
 
00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:13.909 align:start position:0%
that senate practicing president than if
it

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:13.919 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
works for them works for me works for
 
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
you probably
 
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 align:start position:0%
and we have so few votes on this
 
00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
committee you never know when jeff is
 
00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:34.479 align:start position:0%
now the other item that involves a
 
00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:35.110 align:start position:0%
now the other item that involves a
change

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 align:start position:0%
will be on page four over to page
 
00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 align:start position:0%
five in in my side by side um
 
00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:45.199 align:start position:0%
if you do not have a side by side it's
 
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
and this has to do with um
 
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.750 align:start position:0%
and this has to do with um
any

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.189 align:start position:0%
any
[Music]

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:05.199 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
the oversight committee
 
00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
stop an emergency order given by
 
00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:26.639 align:start position:0%
the commissioner and you know for the
 
00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
record i'm a
 
00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
laurie chabonet groupie we've worked on
 
00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
several things largely about
 
00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:36.560 align:start position:0%
issues relating to churches and it was a
 
00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 align:start position:0%
joy and a pleasure to work for her
 
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
or work with her maybe that was a slip
 
00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
that worked with her
 
00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
so any any thing going in here
 
00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
is certainly not about the person of the
 
00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:48.629 align:start position:0%
is certainly not about the person of the
commissioner

00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:48.639 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
but about duties of this and subsequent
 
00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.749 align:start position:0%
but about duties of this and subsequent
commissioners

00:06:53.749 --> 00:06:53.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:56.469 --> 00:06:56.479 align:start position:0%
the feeling we had in health and human
 
00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
services committee
 
00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
and then this bill went to eda which
 
00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
the representative is from was
 
00:07:09.029 --> 00:07:09.039 align:start position:0%
that we the legislature
 
00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:12.080 align:start position:0%
or members of the legislature
 
00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
are a co-equal body to the executive
 
00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:15.430 align:start position:0%
are a co-equal body to the executive
branch

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
branch
 
00:07:19.909 --> 00:07:19.919 align:start position:0%
with its departments and
 
00:07:23.189 --> 00:07:23.199 align:start position:0%
secondly as many of us
 
00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
especially the ones after 9 11 they are
 
00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:32.800 align:start position:0%
for short-term emergencies they're for
 
00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
blizzards or tornadoes or riots or
 
00:07:36.629 --> 00:07:36.639 align:start position:0%
things like that
 
00:07:39.029 --> 00:07:39.039 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that they were conceived
 
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
for pandemics
 
00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:42.639 align:start position:0%
also as we saw the pandemic coming
 
00:07:42.639 --> 00:07:44.230 align:start position:0%
also as we saw the pandemic coming
through

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:44.240 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:07:47.589 --> 00:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
things changed and well
 
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
married to a physician
 
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
i understand how when you say follow the
 
00:07:55.029 --> 00:07:55.039 align:start position:0%
science sometimes the response is
 
00:07:57.909 --> 00:07:57.919 align:start position:0%
as of which day or according to whom and
 
00:07:59.909 --> 00:07:59.919 align:start position:0%
we saw that which in my mind didn't make
 
00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
anybody venal
 
00:08:04.629 --> 00:08:04.639 align:start position:0%
it just simply said what might be given
 
00:08:06.309 --> 00:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
is an edict
 
00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
and proves to be true it might be a
 
00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
group of citizen legislators who have a
 
00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:13.360 align:start position:0%
different opinion and they prove to be
 
00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.070 align:start position:0%
different opinion and they prove to be
true

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
true
 
00:08:17.189 --> 00:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
so we want some
 
00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
vehicle whereby we can say
 
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
we will review certain emergency orders
 
00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:24.720 align:start position:0%
and let me say that i
 
00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:26.800 align:start position:0%
see this also and perhaps especially as
 
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
a safety valve
 
00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
because we have people from whom um
 
00:08:34.469 --> 00:08:34.479 align:start position:0%
they don't want anybody to have orders
 
00:08:37.829 --> 00:08:37.839 align:start position:0%
over them hell no i ain't going to do
 
00:08:39.509 --> 00:08:39.519 align:start position:0%
what you're telling me to do
 
00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
some of these people sit in the
 
00:08:43.589 --> 00:08:43.599 align:start position:0%
legislature and to be able to know that
 
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
with a very high threshold
 
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
perhaps an emergency order
 
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
might be cancelled out my we were
 
00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:54.240 align:start position:0%
talking earlier
 
00:08:58.550 --> 00:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
i i wouldn't ever like to see it happen
 
00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
but i think it has to be here to calm
 
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
some people down
 
00:09:04.389 --> 00:09:04.399 align:start position:0%
and and so for that reason there's other
 
00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:05.360 align:start position:0%
reasons too
 
00:09:07.829 --> 00:09:07.839 align:start position:0%
our leadership republican house
 
00:09:07.839 --> 00:09:08.710 align:start position:0%
our leadership republican house
leadership

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:08.720 align:start position:0%
leadership
 
00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
wants a vehicle whereby an emergency
 
00:09:13.269 --> 00:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
order of the commissioner
 
00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
can be rescinded
 
00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:18.160 align:start position:0%
and that's really going to be the sticky
 
00:09:20.949 --> 00:09:20.959 align:start position:0%
spot here so that's my little
 
00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:29.360 align:start position:0%
um for myself i would just say noted
 
00:09:31.829 --> 00:09:31.839 align:start position:0%
and we probably the three of us probably
 
00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
would want to get together and talk
 
00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
about your proposal
 
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
um representative weber made a great
 
00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
point if you would
 
00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:41.360 align:start position:0%
not mind sharing it about how it came
 
00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:42.720 align:start position:0%
out of our community uh
 
00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:45.200 align:start position:0%
the the other thing that we were just as
 
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:46.240 align:start position:0%
you arrived
 
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
we were trying to track how this has
 
00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
progressed through the house because
 
00:09:52.389 --> 00:09:52.399 align:start position:0%
it went to two separate committees and
 
00:09:54.389 --> 00:09:54.399 align:start position:0%
we were remembering
 
00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:57.200 align:start position:0%
a provision that required a two-thirds
 
00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.430 align:start position:0%
a provision that required a two-thirds
majority

00:09:59.430 --> 00:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
majority
 
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
to override any kind of decision
 
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
of the commissioner uh two thirds of
 
00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:06.790 align:start position:0%
of the commissioner uh two thirds of
oversight

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
yeah oh i was i was thinking of a
 
00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of the house
 
00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:14.240 align:start position:0%
it was two-thirds vote double-check that
 
00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:14.630 align:start position:0%
it was two-thirds vote double-check that
so

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
original document it is of the committee
 
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
okay so but but here's my suggestion for
 
00:10:22.069 --> 00:10:22.079 align:start position:0%
you to think about
 
00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:24.959 align:start position:0%
if if if you want to take some time and
 
00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
think about it is
 
00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:27.680 align:start position:0%
first of all think about super
 
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
majorities both in the committee and
 
00:10:31.509 --> 00:10:31.519 align:start position:0%
potentially in the house
 
00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
and secondly think about
 
00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
a period of time that might be shorter
 
00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
and more comfortable to people so that
 
00:10:41.829 --> 00:10:41.839 align:start position:0%
we are not just
 
00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
leaving a 90-day hiatus
 
00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:47.519 align:start position:0%
so those are two things that i thought
 
00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
might be subject
 
00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
to discussion the other the other thing
 
00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:52.710 align:start position:0%
to discussion the other the other thing
that

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:52.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
is interesting with this is that of
 
00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:56.230 align:start position:0%
is interesting with this is that of
course

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:56.240 align:start position:0%
course
 
00:10:59.030 --> 00:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
if the house is bent on doing this the
 
00:10:59.040 --> 00:10:59.590 align:start position:0%
if the house is bent on doing this the
house

00:10:59.590 --> 00:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
house
 
00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
the legislature not just the house but
 
00:11:02.949 --> 00:11:02.959 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
far easier in the senate than the house
 
00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:08.240 align:start position:0%
actually the legislature can simply
 
00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
convene itself and do whatever they want
 
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
item number one so if there's a
 
00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:15.190 align:start position:0%
item number one so if there's a
significant

00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:15.200 align:start position:0%
significant
 
00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
sentiment this is the wrong direction uh
 
00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
the legislature can take care of that
 
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:22.240 align:start position:0%
the other
 
00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
the other thing is that the commissioner
 
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
can simply ask the governor to do it by
 
00:11:28.389 --> 00:11:28.399 align:start position:0%
emergency order and
 
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
then we're in a different part of the
 
00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
statutory scheme
 
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
so i throw all of that out senator
 
00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.350 align:start position:0%
so i throw all of that out senator
sherman

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
sherman
 
00:11:41.829 --> 00:11:41.839 align:start position:0%
just my objection to
 
00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
would act i mean we're not talking about
 
00:11:51.269 --> 00:11:51.279 align:start position:0%
any specific action that may have
 
00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:53.680 align:start position:0%
occurred during covet but what we saw
 
00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
with cove
 
00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
especially in the very early phase of
 
00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.030 align:start position:0%
especially in the very early phase of
code

00:11:59.030 --> 00:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
code
 
00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
as you said the science was being built
 
00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
it wasn't quite there and so
 
00:12:08.629 --> 00:12:08.639 align:start position:0%
what the the decisions that were being
 
00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:10.720 align:start position:0%
made were based on
 
00:12:14.069 --> 00:12:14.079 align:start position:0%
the latest available silent science
 
00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
but also turning to the expertise of
 
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
people like ben
 
00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:22.160 align:start position:0%
chan and beth daley and
 
00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
lisa morris all of whom
 
00:12:28.949 --> 00:12:28.959 align:start position:0%
are specialists not just
 
00:12:32.269 --> 00:12:32.279 align:start position:0%
in healthcare and is the state
 
00:12:32.279 --> 00:12:34.230 align:start position:0%
in healthcare and is the state
epidemiologist

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:34.240 align:start position:0%
epidemiologist
 
00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
but also it's public health
 
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
and the success of our response
 
00:12:46.389 --> 00:12:46.399 align:start position:0%
to kobat really was
 
00:12:50.389 --> 00:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
the commissioner turning to expertise
 
00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
in how do we manage a pandemic
 
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
for a health care standpoint and then
 
00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
very rapidly
 
00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
uh they created said mac which was the
 
00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
price of standards of care committee
 
00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
i sat on that and i've never sat
 
00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:10.160 align:start position:0%
on a panel in new hampshire with more
 
00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
expertise whether it was nursing home
 
00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:14.389 align:start position:0%
expertise whether it was nursing home
experts

00:13:14.389 --> 00:13:14.399 align:start position:0%
experts
 
00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
to child exercise
 
00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
and that was the body that was making
 
00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.550 align:start position:0%
and that was the body that was making
recommendations

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
starting i think we started in may may
 
00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
or june
 
00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
what really concerns me about this is
 
00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:31.670 align:start position:0%
what really concerns me about this is
that

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:34.720 align:start position:0%
you have this body of experts under
 
00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
the commissioner under the governor in
 
00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
and then you have a small body of
 
00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
legislators who can shut that down
 
00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
if i read this correctly if i write this
 
00:13:52.389 --> 00:13:52.399 align:start position:0%
correctly for 90 days
 
00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
with no definite oversight they can just
 
00:13:59.189 --> 00:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:02.629 --> 00:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
and or him depending on
 
00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
the commissioner so i
 
00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
i am very concerned about in the middle
 
00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
of some kind of crisis which is where
 
00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:13.279 align:start position:0%
the word emergency is
 
00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:17.680 align:start position:0%
involved we have a legislative body
 
00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
potentially with no expertise
 
00:14:24.629 --> 00:14:24.639 align:start position:0%
being able to say no and the analogy i
 
00:14:26.389 --> 00:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
would give is the person who presents to
 
00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
the emergency room
 
00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
with chest pain and you have a
 
00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:32.720 align:start position:0%
cardiologist called in and he says
 
00:14:35.829 --> 00:14:35.839 align:start position:0%
we need to go to the cath lab then you
 
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
call up
 
00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:40.240 align:start position:0%
the president of the hospital who has
 
00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
no expertise but is involved because
 
00:14:44.069 --> 00:14:44.079 align:start position:0%
he's president
 
00:14:47.189 --> 00:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
he says sorry i don't agree
 
00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
all right and until then so i'm just
 
00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:50.389 align:start position:0%
all right and until then so i'm just
worried

00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
worried
 
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
if i could just finish him so i worry
 
00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:55.590 align:start position:0%
if i could just finish him so i worry
about

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:58.550 --> 00:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
the ability to completely block the
 
00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:00.150 align:start position:0%
the ability to completely block the
action

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:00.160 align:start position:0%
action
 
00:15:02.389 --> 00:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
uh whether what's felt to be the
 
00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:04.160 align:start position:0%
necessary response
 
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:06.720 align:start position:0%
a nimble science-based response on the
 
00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
part of the commission
 
00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
is the first name senator on this one
 
00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
yes sir i want to shut this one down
 
00:15:16.069 --> 00:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
it is clear to me that our position is
 
00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:17.680 align:start position:0%
we prefer the senate position
 
00:15:19.509 --> 00:15:19.519 align:start position:0%
if you want us to consider other
 
00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
language it's probably not the language
 
00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:21.910 align:start position:0%
language it's probably not the language
that's

00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
in your bill right now and i want to
 
00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:26.240 align:start position:0%
make sure that we have time to get
 
00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:26.629 align:start position:0%
make sure that we have time to get
through

00:15:26.629 --> 00:15:26.639 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:15:29.749 --> 00:15:29.759 align:start position:0%
all of your concerns before 9 30 because
 
00:15:31.189 --> 00:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
many of us have
 
00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
other meetings to attend so so please
 
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:34.550 align:start position:0%
other meetings to attend so so please
consider

00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
consider
 
00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
the senate language and whatever else
 
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
you have
 
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
if i could just add this too i mean this
 
00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:41.350 align:start position:0%
if i could just add this too i mean this
is

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
going along at the same time as uh
 
00:15:48.389 --> 00:15:48.399 align:start position:0%
household 417. so
 
00:15:50.389 --> 00:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
i would like to think that a resolution
 
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
of 417
 
00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:53.680 align:start position:0%
would make this a lot easier that
 
00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
comedian conference meets at 11. let's
 
00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
see what happens
 
00:15:59.110 --> 00:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
so maybe we should come back tomorrow
 
00:15:59.829 --> 00:15:59.839 align:start position:0%
can i be
 
00:16:01.509 --> 00:16:01.519 align:start position:0%
uh representative can i interject with
 
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
the dna philosophy
 
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
sure as to what's going on here before i
 
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
as we'll have to leave it now
 
00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
um to your point senator in the
 
00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
discussion of the public health
 
00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:11.670 align:start position:0%
discussion of the public health
officials

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
officials
 
00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that the state of
 
00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire did no primary research
 
00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
on pope so they were taking cues from uh
 
00:16:17.829 --> 00:16:17.839 align:start position:0%
from a net
 
00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
a higher level um so as far as their
 
00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
response to that within the state of new
 
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire sure
 
00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:24.720 align:start position:0%
but the science that's driving that
 
00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:26.240 align:start position:0%
response was
 
00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
was not primarily done in new hampshire
 
00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
so so there's a
 
00:16:30.949 --> 00:16:30.959 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit of of them
 
00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
following the direction
 
00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
and opinions of say the cdc or
 
00:16:40.069 --> 00:16:40.079 align:start position:0%
or a national a national
 
00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
science opinion on that but secondly to
 
00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
to your point with the
 
00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
with this the edna's concern is that you
 
00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
know and i'm glad you brought up
 
00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
417 in the governor whereas the concept
 
00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:52.240 align:start position:0%
of having a check on the governor's
 
00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
ability to
 
00:16:56.310 --> 00:16:56.320 align:start position:0%
as far as the governor's emergency
 
00:16:58.389 --> 00:16:58.399 align:start position:0%
orders the concern
 
00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
here is that the health and human
 
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
services commissioner which is
 
00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
in most people's or some people's view a
 
00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:07.350 align:start position:0%
in most people's or some people's view a
bureaucrat

00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
bureaucrat
 
00:17:09.429 --> 00:17:09.439 align:start position:0%
would then now have power that is
 
00:17:09.439 --> 00:17:10.630 align:start position:0%
would then now have power that is
actually

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:10.640 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:17:13.029 --> 00:17:13.039 align:start position:0%
greater than the governor with it with
 
00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
no ability to check
 
00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
on the health and human services
 
00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:18.079 align:start position:0%
commissioner and there is concern that
 
00:17:19.909 --> 00:17:19.919 align:start position:0%
if the governor does have
 
00:17:21.429 --> 00:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
restrictions and the legislature does
 
00:17:23.429 --> 00:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
have the ability to
 
00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
uh to check the governor's emergency
 
00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:26.720 align:start position:0%
orders that that a
 
00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
governor would then just use the health
 
00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
and human services commissioner
 
00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:33.440 align:start position:0%
to enact an emergency out order
 
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
that has less ability to be rescinded
 
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
and just use that as a vessel to get
 
00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:38.720 align:start position:0%
what they want
 
00:17:40.789 --> 00:17:40.799 align:start position:0%
let me well if i could just answer go
 
00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
ahead i think having been in this
 
00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:44.320 align:start position:0%
building a long time most
 
00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:46.720 align:start position:0%
hhs commissioners answer to the governor
 
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
so i think in most circumstances your
 
00:17:50.789 --> 00:17:50.799 align:start position:0%
concern would not be
 
00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
significant but again i think
 
00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
it for purposes of 187
 
00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
we'd be best advised to see what happens
 
00:18:02.789 --> 00:18:02.799 align:start position:0%
with 417
 
00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
and then if there's an agreement on 417
 
00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
then potentially
 
00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
that kind of agreement could be
 
00:18:11.669 --> 00:18:11.679 align:start position:0%
reflected in 187.
 
00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
that's all i'm trying that sounds
 
00:18:15.669 --> 00:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
reasonable um
 
00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
i was asked i was not on the economic
 
00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
task force that gave guidance but i was
 
00:18:23.669 --> 00:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
asked by that group
 
00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
to speak to dhhs
 
00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:28.720 align:start position:0%
on behalf of churches having been an
 
00:18:30.789 --> 00:18:30.799 align:start position:0%
episcopal priest for 47 years
 
00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
as well as a legislator for five and
 
00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
there were several occasions where they
 
00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
called me they asked
 
00:18:38.789 --> 00:18:38.799 align:start position:0%
there was one occasion when i called
 
00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:40.720 align:start position:0%
someone and i said this isn't going to
 
00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:42.320 align:start position:0%
stand yeah but that's the order
 
00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
i said it is not going to stand because
 
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:46.720 align:start position:0%
it is treating churches in a manner that
 
00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
is different from
 
00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:51.440 align:start position:0%
other similar organizations and has been
 
00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
adjudicated seven times and the churches
 
00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
won six out of seven
 
00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
oh well it will take us seven or eight
 
00:18:59.029 --> 00:18:59.039 align:start position:0%
days to work this through the system
 
00:19:01.669 --> 00:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
i said um we have a situation brewing
 
00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
they called back and said thank you
 
00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
representative pearson we exceed
 
00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
so there are times when somebody who
 
00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
