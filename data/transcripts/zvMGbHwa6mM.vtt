and<00:01:20.640><c> it</c><00:01:20.720><c> was</c><00:01:20.960><c> dropped</c><00:01:21.280><c> to</c>

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 align:start position:0%
and it was dropped to
 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.030 align:start position:0%
and it was dropped to
two<00:01:22.799><c> in</c><00:01:23.119><c> statute</c><00:01:23.520><c> i</c><00:01:23.600><c> think</c><00:01:23.759><c> it</c><00:01:23.840><c> was</c><00:01:24.000><c> last</c><00:01:24.240><c> year</c>

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
two in statute i think it was last year
 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.030 align:start position:0%
two in statute i think it was last year
yeah<00:01:25.360><c> and</c><00:01:25.520><c> so</c>

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
yeah and so
 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.710 align:start position:0%
yeah and so
i<00:01:27.200><c> think</c><00:01:27.360><c> this</c><00:01:27.600><c> was</c><00:01:27.840><c> partially</c><00:01:28.320><c> at</c><00:01:28.400><c> the</c>

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 align:start position:0%
i think this was partially at the
 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.469 align:start position:0%
i think this was partially at the
request<00:01:29.119><c> of</c><00:01:29.280><c> the</c><00:01:29.360><c> department</c><00:01:29.920><c> partially</c>

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 align:start position:0%
request of the department partially
 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.749 align:start position:0%
request of the department partially
requested<00:01:31.200><c> senate</c><00:01:32.640><c> because</c><00:01:33.040><c> you</c><00:01:33.200><c> know</c><00:01:33.360><c> if</c><00:01:33.520><c> you</c>

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 align:start position:0%
requested senate because you know if you
 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.190 align:start position:0%
requested senate because you know if you
put<00:01:34.000><c> three</c><00:01:34.400><c> on</c><00:01:34.560><c> you</c><00:01:34.799><c> might</c><00:01:34.960><c> get</c><00:01:35.200><c> one</c>

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
put three on you might get one
 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.990 align:start position:0%
put three on you might get one
that's<00:01:37.520><c> just</c><00:01:37.759><c> an</c><00:01:38.000><c> attendance</c><00:01:38.560><c> issue</c><00:01:38.960><c> so</c><00:01:39.840><c> it</c>

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
that's just an attendance issue so it
 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.030 align:start position:0%
that's just an attendance issue so it
would<00:01:40.159><c> be</c>

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
would be
 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.069 align:start position:0%
would be
great

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:44.079 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:47.190 align:start position:0%
 
and<00:01:44.479><c> i</c><00:01:44.880><c> think</c><00:01:45.119><c> when</c><00:01:45.360><c> we</c><00:01:45.520><c> were</c><00:01:46.000><c> talking</c>

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 align:start position:0%
and i think when we were talking
 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.190 align:start position:0%
and i think when we were talking
you<00:01:47.360><c> and</c><00:01:47.520><c> i</c><00:01:47.680><c> mr</c><00:01:48.000><c> chairman</c><00:01:48.399><c> about</c><00:01:48.560><c> drafting</c><00:01:49.119><c> in</c>

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
you and i mr chairman about drafting in
 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.310 align:start position:0%
you and i mr chairman about drafting in
the<00:01:49.360><c> house</c>

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 align:start position:0%
the house
 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.389 align:start position:0%
the house
i<00:01:50.560><c> simply</c><00:01:50.960><c> said</c><00:01:51.280><c> i</c><00:01:51.439><c> never</c><00:01:51.840><c> had</c><00:01:53.200><c> three</c><00:01:53.680><c> ever</c>

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 align:start position:0%
i simply said i never had three ever
 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:56.870 align:start position:0%
i simply said i never had three ever
so<00:01:55.040><c> perhaps</c><00:01:55.439><c> we</c><00:01:55.600><c> could</c><00:01:55.759><c> just</c><00:01:55.920><c> put</c><00:01:56.159><c> it</c><00:01:56.320><c> at</c><00:01:56.479><c> two</c>

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
so perhaps we could just put it at two
 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.630 align:start position:0%
so perhaps we could just put it at two
because<00:01:57.200><c> i</c><00:01:57.280><c> was</c><00:01:57.520><c> concerned</c><00:01:57.920><c> about</c><00:01:58.240><c> issues</c><00:01:58.479><c> of</c>

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 align:start position:0%
because i was concerned about issues of
 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.670 align:start position:0%
because i was concerned about issues of

yeah oh i was i was thinking of a
 

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.030 align:start position:0%
yeah oh i was i was thinking of a
two-thirds<00:10:10.240><c> of</c><00:10:10.320><c> the</c><00:10:10.560><c> house</c>

if if if you want to take some time and
 

00:10:24.959 --> 00:10:26.310 align:start position:0%
if if if you want to take some time and

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
think about it is
 

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.670 align:start position:0%
think about it is
first<00:10:26.560><c> of</c><00:10:26.720><c> all</c><00:10:26.880><c> think</c><00:10:27.120><c> about</c><00:10:27.360><c> super</c>

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:27.680 align:start position:0%
first of all think about super
 

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.430 align:start position:0%
first of all think about super
majorities<00:10:28.399><c> both</c><00:10:28.640><c> in</c><00:10:28.720><c> the</c><00:10:28.880><c> committee</c><00:10:29.279><c> and</c>

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
majorities both in the committee and
 

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.509 align:start position:0%
majorities both in the committee and
potentially<00:10:30.079><c> in</c><00:10:30.160><c> the</c><00:10:30.320><c> house</c>

00:10:31.509 --> 00:10:31.519 align:start position:0%
potentially in the house
 

00:10:31.519 --> 00:10:35.590 align:start position:0%
potentially in the house
and<00:10:32.000><c> secondly</c><00:10:33.040><c> think</c><00:10:33.360><c> about</c>

00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
and secondly think about
 

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:38.870 align:start position:0%
and secondly think about
a<00:10:36.079><c> period</c><00:10:36.720><c> of</c><00:10:37.040><c> time</c><00:10:37.600><c> that</c><00:10:37.839><c> might</c><00:10:38.079><c> be</c><00:10:38.399><c> shorter</c>

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
a period of time that might be shorter
 

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:40.790 align:start position:0%
a period of time that might be shorter
and<00:10:39.120><c> more</c><00:10:39.360><c> comfortable</c><00:10:39.920><c> to</c><00:10:40.079><c> people</c><00:10:40.480><c> so</c><00:10:40.640><c> that</c>

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
and more comfortable to people so that
 

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:41.829 align:start position:0%
and more comfortable to people so that
we<00:10:41.040><c> are</c><00:10:41.200><c> not</c><00:10:41.440><c> just</c>

00:10:41.829 --> 00:10:41.839 align:start position:0%
we are not just
 

00:10:41.839 --> 00:10:45.430 align:start position:0%
we are not just
leaving<00:10:42.320><c> a</c><00:10:42.720><c> 90-day</c><00:10:43.360><c> hiatus</c>

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
leaving a 90-day hiatus
 

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.509 align:start position:0%
leaving a 90-day hiatus
so<00:10:45.600><c> those</c><00:10:45.920><c> are</c><00:10:46.160><c> two</c><00:10:46.399><c> things</c><00:10:46.720><c> that</c><00:10:46.880><c> i</c><00:10:47.040><c> thought</c>

00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:47.519 align:start position:0%
so those are two things that i thought
 

00:10:47.519 --> 00:10:48.870 align:start position:0%
so those are two things that i thought
might<00:10:47.839><c> be</c><00:10:48.240><c> subject</c>

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
