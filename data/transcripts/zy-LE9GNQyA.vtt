00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.440 align:start position:0%
go ahead and um get started with the the
 
00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
special hearing um Mr
 
00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
Ripple is this a is this a public
 
00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:29.479 align:start position:0%
hearing is this some um do we need the
 
00:06:33.749 --> 00:06:33.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
on it isn't on just yet but it will be I
 
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:38.280 align:start position:0%
think they usually wait for you to open
 
00:06:42.309 --> 00:06:42.319 align:start position:0%
it so it should be on actually I'm I've
 
00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:44.440 align:start position:0%
really become much more a heart of
 
00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
hearing so it's on now okay thank you so
 
00:06:53.589 --> 00:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
much all right so um I would like to
 
00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:56.360 align:start position:0%
refer to this as a special hearing just
 
00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
to make everyone feel like they they're
 
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
not wasting their time I'm here today
 
00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:04.120 align:start position:0%
this is um an educational session I
 
00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:07.120 align:start position:0%
don't expect us to there's nothing for
 
00:07:11.749 --> 00:07:11.759 align:start position:0%
us to vote on um so this is really uh an
 
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity for members of of the
 
00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:18.800 align:start position:0%
division three to cross level what they
 
00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:21.080 align:start position:0%
know about tanif tanif is a pretty
 
00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:23.360 align:start position:0%
important program it's got a lot of
 
00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
flexibility in it um I think uh we could
 
00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
potentially uh think more about uh how
 
00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:33.960 align:start position:0%
we would want to proactively use it um
 
00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:36.360 align:start position:0%
in the next budget cycle for those of us
 
00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:40.520 align:start position:0%
that uh come back to this um this um
 
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
committee uh I know that uh
 
00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
representative walner has paid some
 
00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
attention to tanif in the past and and
 
00:07:51.029 --> 00:07:51.039 align:start position:0%
brought forward legislation in
 
00:07:54.749 --> 00:07:54.759 align:start position:0%
hb2 that uh where we spent tanif money
 
00:07:56.909 --> 00:07:56.919 align:start position:0%
and um and I felt a little embarrassed
 
00:07:59.749 --> 00:07:59.759 align:start position:0%
by it because I didn't fully real
 
00:08:02.909 --> 00:08:02.919 align:start position:0%
realize what flexibility we had with
 
00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
that program and and what other
 
00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:07.560 align:start position:0%
opportunities we might have had so this
 
00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:11.240 align:start position:0%
is this is my attempt to have us get um
 
00:08:13.029 --> 00:08:13.039 align:start position:0%
get ahead of the budget cycle a little
 
00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:15.400 align:start position:0%
bit get a little bit smarter about this
 
00:08:18.469 --> 00:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
important program and uh and I've
 
00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:21.400 align:start position:0%
proposed an agenda I assume you've
 
00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
received it Mr Herbert yes I have
 
00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:26.599 align:start position:0%
received it thank you okay you have any
 
00:08:29.029 --> 00:08:29.039 align:start position:0%
problems with it like anything that you
 
00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:31.240 align:start position:0%
don't think we can cover today not at
 
00:08:33.509 --> 00:08:33.519 align:start position:0%
all okay
 
00:08:37.149 --> 00:08:37.159 align:start position:0%
fantastic um okay so with that I think
 
00:08:39.949 --> 00:08:39.959 align:start position:0%

DHHS I just would ask you because I I
 
00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:52.160 align:start position:0%
don't know why my hearing is so off but
 
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:55.240 align:start position:0%

that better it is better okay so I just
 
00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to say thank you for your
 
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
interest in the TANF program TANF does
 
00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:08.120 align:start position:0%
stand for temporary assistance for needy
 
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:10.600 align:start position:0%
families uh and I appreciate the agenda
 
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
that you provided um my presentation
 
00:09:17.509 --> 00:09:17.519 align:start position:0%
will take more or less 15 minutes uh and
 
00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:20.200 align:start position:0%
I will address every item that is on
 
00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.310 align:start position:0%
I will address every item that is on
your

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:21.320 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:24.680 align:start position:0%
list uh so tanif was created by the
 
00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:26.600 align:start position:0%
federal government in
 
00:09:30.269 --> 00:09:30.279 align:start position:0%
1996 it is a fixed block grant for
 
00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:33.240 align:start position:0%
states and the federal statute uh for
 
00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
tanif provides that tanif grants must be
 
00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
used in any manner reasonably calculated
 
00:09:40.829 --> 00:09:40.839 align:start position:0%
to accomplish one or more of the
 
00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:43.320 align:start position:0%
following four purposes if you leave
 
00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
with nothing else today these are the
 
00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
key uh pieces to tanif that uh pretty
 
00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
much Drive uh Drive the Grant and and
 
00:09:54.949 --> 00:09:54.959 align:start position:0%
that sounds like the four bullet points
 
00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:57.160 align:start position:0%
that are on the second page that's
 
00:09:59.389 --> 00:09:59.399 align:start position:0%
that's correct all right thank you so to
 
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
provide assistance to needy families so
 
00:10:02.829 --> 00:10:02.839 align:start position:0%
that children may be cared for in their
 
00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
own homes or in homes of relatives
 
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
that's the first purpose the second is
 
00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
to end the dependence of needy parents
 
00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
on government benefits by promoting job
 
00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:14.920 align:start position:0%
preparation work and
 
00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
marriage the third is to prevent and
 
00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
reduce the incidence of outof wedlock
 
00:10:21.949 --> 00:10:21.959 align:start position:0%
pregnancies and to establish annual
 
00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
numerical goals for preventing and
 
00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
reducing the incidents of these
 
00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:28.760 align:start position:0%
pregnancies and the fourth purpose is to
 
00:10:30.269 --> 00:10:30.279 align:start position:0%
encourage enourage the formation and
 
00:10:33.829 --> 00:10:33.839 align:start position:0%
maintenance of two parent
 
00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
families on slide three will you will
 
00:10:38.389 --> 00:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
you take questions as we go make this a
 
00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:41.000 align:start position:0%
little more conversational I'd be happy
 
00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:44.600 align:start position:0%
to that's what you prefer okay so
 
00:10:47.829 --> 00:10:47.839 align:start position:0%
bullets two three and four I think are
 
00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
fascinating to me because uh as issues
 
00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:55.240 align:start position:0%
of of government policy I'm I'm actually
 
00:10:58.069 --> 00:10:58.079 align:start position:0%
not very familiar even after paying
 
00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:00.720 align:start position:0%
attention for 20 30 years what
 
00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:02.680 align:start position:0%
government has done to encourage
 
00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
marriage um and to parent families so do
 
00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:10.360 align:start position:0%
you have some examples of things that we
 
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
are actively doing in New Hampshire to
 
00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
do any of two three or
 
00:11:18.069 --> 00:11:18.079 align:start position:0%
four I'm going to talk a little bit
 
00:11:20.069 --> 00:11:20.079 align:start position:0%
about that through the presentation and
 
00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:24.200 align:start position:0%
specifically more focused on number two
 
00:11:28.269 --> 00:11:28.279 align:start position:0%
um as well as three and that is in
 
00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:30.360 align:start position:0%
collaboration with other programs in
 
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
DHHS such as child
 
00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:37.240 align:start position:0%
support okay so on two if you could just
 
00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:40.720 align:start position:0%
come back to the marriage part because I
 
00:11:44.389 --> 00:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
I I I can see how government works to uh
 
00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:47.800 align:start position:0%
promote job prep and work but uh it's
 
00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
the it's that marriage encouragement
 
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
that just has me baffled it's more of a
 
00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
prevention strategy um so that you could
 
00:11:59.629 --> 00:11:59.639 align:start position:0%
prevent um the need for for Public
 
00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:02.240 align:start position:0%
Assistance programs uh and I can't off
 
00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
the top of my head point to a particular
 
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
initiative that has been specifically or
 
00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
directly um targeting the prevention of
 
00:12:14.629 --> 00:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
Public Assistance uh in terms of
 
00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
marriage promotion but um indirectly I
 
00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:27.160 align:start position:0%
that so the next slide page
 
00:12:30.389 --> 00:12:30.399 align:start position:0%
three states fund their tan of programs
 
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
with a combination of federal and state
 
00:12:36.509 --> 00:12:36.519 align:start position:0%
funds there are two primary Parts the
 
00:12:38.949 --> 00:12:38.959 align:start position:0%
first is the annual federal block grant
 
00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:41.560 align:start position:0%
which for New Hampshire is $38
 
00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:44.440 align:start position:0%
million the second primary part is the
 
00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
annual state funded maintenance of
 
00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:49.000 align:start position:0%
effort also referred to
 
00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:52.240 align:start position:0%
ASE which for New Hampshire is $32
 
00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:55.320 align:start position:0%
million so so help me with the math is
 
00:12:58.269 --> 00:12:58.279 align:start position:0%
is that a total of um 60 million
 
00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
altogether or or does the maintenance of
 
00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:05.160 align:start position:0%
effort bring in money beyond the 38
 
00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.870 align:start position:0%
effort bring in money beyond the 38
[Music]

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:10.360 align:start position:0%
million no it's it's 60 million total Mr
 
00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:14.920 align:start position:0%
White 70 yep 70 million oh God it's been
 
00:13:18.269 --> 00:13:18.279 align:start position:0%
a long time it's math right so in
 
00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:20.720 align:start position:0%
addition uh New Hampshire currently has
 
00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
what is known as the tanif
 
00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:27.560 align:start position:0%
balance currently that balance is at $69
 
00:13:30.949 --> 00:13:30.959 align:start position:0%
million as of September 30th of
 
00:13:34.949 --> 00:13:34.959 align:start position:0%
2023 this amount includes the current
 
00:13:39.069 --> 00:13:39.079 align:start position:0%
Year's block grant of 38
 
00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
million so of the 69 million um is it is
 
00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
it non- lapsing or it is that's non-aps
 
00:13:50.629 --> 00:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
so we just need to figure out what our
 
00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:53.160 align:start position:0%
long-term strategy is for this I think
 
00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
right all right and do you already have
 
00:13:58.389 --> 00:13:58.399 align:start position:0%
one I am going to touch on some of the
 
00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:00.920 align:start position:0%
future plans that we do have as well as
 
00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:01.949 align:start position:0%
future plans that we do have as well as
current

00:14:01.949 --> 00:14:01.959 align:start position:0%
current
 
00:14:04.749 --> 00:14:04.759 align:start position:0%
initiatives okay do any of the members
 
00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
already think they have a long-term view
 
00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:10.120 align:start position:0%
of where to go with this 69
 
00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
million this is the beginning of the
 
00:14:14.829 --> 00:14:14.839 align:start position:0%
year well it's been around though this
 
00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:22.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:29.389 --> 00:14:29.399 align:start position:0%
bium Y
 
00:14:31.629 --> 00:14:31.639 align:start position:0%
all right all right go ahead so the
 
00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:33.880 align:start position:0%
federal tan funds are used by the state
 
00:14:36.389 --> 00:14:36.399 align:start position:0%
to provide
 
00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:38.920 align:start position:0%
assistance and the recipients are
 
00:14:40.829 --> 00:14:40.839 align:start position:0%
subject to work participation
 
00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:43.160 align:start position:0%
requirements as well as a 5-year time
 
00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:45.880 align:start position:0%
limit on the federal assistance and the
 
00:14:47.829 --> 00:14:47.839 align:start position:0%
state is subject to data reporting and
 
00:14:47.839 --> 00:14:48.749 align:start position:0%
state is subject to data reporting and
certain

00:14:48.749 --> 00:14:48.759 align:start position:0%
certain
 
00:14:50.949 --> 00:14:50.959 align:start position:0%
prohibitions these restrictions do not
 
00:14:52.829 --> 00:14:52.839 align:start position:0%
generally apply to other services and
 
00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
benefits that are not referred to as
 
00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
assistance states have broad discretion
 
00:15:00.749 --> 00:15:00.759 align:start position:0%
to provide a wide range of benefits and
 
00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
services and to set different
 
00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
eligibility standards for the different
 
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
types of
 
00:15:10.629 --> 00:15:10.639 align:start position:0%
benefits for statee funds whether the
 
00:15:13.749 --> 00:15:13.759 align:start position:0%
state spends $1 doll of all the federal
 
00:15:17.629 --> 00:15:17.639 align:start position:0%
dollars states still have to spend all
 
00:15:22.509 --> 00:15:22.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:25.389 --> 00:15:25.399 align:start position:0%
dollars with respect to the tanif
 
00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
balance many states have un unobligated
 
00:15:31.069 --> 00:15:31.079 align:start position:0%
T of funds available giving them an
 
00:15:32.949 --> 00:15:32.959 align:start position:0%
opportunity to invest in families with
 
00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:36.160 align:start position:0%
significant barriers to employment to
 
00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:38.240 align:start position:0%
provide add additional supports for
 
00:15:41.509 --> 00:15:41.519 align:start position:0%
lowincome Working Families or design
 
00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
pregnancy prevention and family
 
00:15:47.069 --> 00:15:47.079 align:start position:0%
formation programs efforts must extend
 
00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
to reach needy families including those
 
00:15:52.309 --> 00:15:52.319 align:start position:0%
who face multiple barriers to success
 
00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:54.720 align:start position:0%
and who face time limits for receiving
 
00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.269 align:start position:0%
and who face time limits for receiving
Public

00:15:56.269 --> 00:15:56.279 align:start position:0%
Public
 
00:15:59.670 --> 00:15:59.680 align:start position:0%
Assistance States May transfer up to 30%
 
00:16:02.189 --> 00:16:02.199 align:start position:0%
of their Tana funds for a fiscal year to
 
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
the child care and Development Fund also
 
00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:05.720 align:start position:0%
known as
 
00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:08.240 align:start position:0%
ccdf as well as the social services
 
00:16:12.069 --> 00:16:12.079 align:start position:0%
block grant referred to as
 
00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
ssbg with respect to certain
 
00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
prohibitions we are prohibited from uh
 
00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
providing uh assistance or using the
 
00:16:25.069 --> 00:16:25.079 align:start position:0%
funds for certain teen parents convicted
 
00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:28.680 align:start position:0%
felons individuals convicted of fraud
 
00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:31.880 align:start position:0%
medical services and there is a 15% cap
 
00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:33.839 align:start position:0%
on administrative
 
00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
expenditures we are prohibited to use
 
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
this fund for other programs supplanting
 
00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
or satisfying matching requirements or
 
00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
things like buildings or
 
00:16:47.629 --> 00:16:47.639 align:start position:0%
construction so so a question before we
 
00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
leave that page um the um the second and
 
00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
last bullet says the states May transfer
 
00:16:59.030 --> 00:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
up to 30% of tanif is that
 
00:17:02.069 --> 00:17:02.079 align:start position:0%
um the com the com combination of
 
00:17:06.669 --> 00:17:06.679 align:start position:0%
federal ande or is that just federal or
 
00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:07.880 align:start position:0%
is that just
 
00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
the it's just Federal it's it's a 30% of
 
00:17:15.429 --> 00:17:15.439 align:start position:0%
the federal correct so 30% of 69 million
 
00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:19.720 align:start position:0%
to start the next budget 30% of 38
 
00:17:23.789 --> 00:17:23.799 align:start position:0%
million yes good and
 
00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:26.079 align:start position:0%
then do you know if
 
00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:29.320 align:start position:0%
ccdf or ssbg
 
00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:31.640 align:start position:0%
either of them carry an
 
00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:34.440 align:start position:0%
explicit Mission or function or
 
00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
objective to prevent out OFW
 
00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:43.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:45.789 --> 00:17:45.799 align:start position:0%
families there is no there isn't a
 
00:17:48.029 --> 00:17:48.039 align:start position:0%
current initiative uh that I'm aware of
 
00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
for ssbg or for ccdf uh with the use of
 
00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:53.640 align:start position:0%
tan of funds for either of those
 
00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:55.720 align:start position:0%
programs so so if the legislature
 
00:17:58.390 --> 00:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
thought those were important functions
 
00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:00.760 align:start position:0%
transferring the money out wouldn't
 
00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:03.320 align:start position:0%
necessarily be a good way to get the
 
00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
resources no and it's important to note
 
00:18:08.789 --> 00:18:08.799 align:start position:0%
that if you do transfer money to either
 
00:18:11.029 --> 00:18:11.039 align:start position:0%
ccdf or
 
00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:14.600 align:start position:0%
ssbg the the funding then takes the form
 
00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
and characteristics of those particular
 
00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:19.480 align:start position:0%
grants which have a whole host of other
 
00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:22.200 align:start position:0%
requirements to each of them all right
 
00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.029 align:start position:0%
requirements to each of them all right
thank

00:18:24.029 --> 00:18:24.039 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:18:26.789 --> 00:18:26.799 align:start position:0%
you does anyone have any questions at
 
00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:29.960 align:start position:0%
this point go ahead represent
 
00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
tki thank you thank you for taking my
 
00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:34.720 align:start position:0%
question I'm just reflecting a little
 
00:18:36.149 --> 00:18:36.159 align:start position:0%
bit on
 
00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
the um prevention of out of wedlock
 
00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
childbearing in terms of the fact that
 
00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
it's um temporary assistance for needy
 
00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:50.950 align:start position:0%
it's um temporary assistance for needy
families

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
families
 
00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
and how the funds can are they can it be
 
00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:57.320 align:start position:0%
money directly
 
00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:01.480 align:start position:0%
to families or women to prevent out OFW
 
00:19:04.149 --> 00:19:04.159 align:start position:0%
like childbearing or can that money be
 
00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
used to say agencies that have
 
00:19:11.029 --> 00:19:11.039 align:start position:0%
educational programming and counseling
 
00:19:11.039 --> 00:19:12.070 align:start position:0%
educational programming and counseling
for

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:19:14.149 --> 00:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
that thank you for the question it's an
 
00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
excellent question I uh would have to
 
00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:18.200 align:start position:0%
look into that particular detail a
 
00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
little bit deeper I can tell you that we
 
00:19:22.909 --> 00:19:22.919 align:start position:0%
would uh need to be able to take a look
 
00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:25.720 align:start position:0%
at what kind of an initiative we would
 
00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
um uh be considering to um to have for
 
00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:35.320 align:start position:0%
that particular purpose um right now our
 
00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:38.600 align:start position:0%
primary focus is on the assistance cash
 
00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
assistance as well as uh the work um
 
00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
work requirements and uh trying
 
00:19:49.669 --> 00:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
to move people out of Public Assistance
 
00:19:52.909 --> 00:19:52.919 align:start position:0%
by way of employment and supports for
 
00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:55.720 align:start position:0%
employment can I ask a followup please
 
00:19:58.430 --> 00:19:58.440 align:start position:0%
so what I guess I'm trying to understand
 
00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
and I just use that as an example is
 
00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
this money goes
 
00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
directly to support an individual or a
 
00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
family or cash assistance to a family
 
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
this money does not necessarily go to
 
00:20:15.909 --> 00:20:15.919 align:start position:0%
agencies or partners that um provide the
 
00:20:15.919 --> 00:20:16.950 align:start position:0%
agencies or partners that um provide the
social

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
social
 
00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
assistance and resources that are
 
00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:22.280 align:start position:0%
sometimes needed or is it a mix of both
 
00:20:24.789 --> 00:20:24.799 align:start position:0%
it's it could be used for you know the
 
00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
formation of a particular type of
 
00:20:29.909 --> 00:20:29.919 align:start position:0%
service that may Target those particular
 
00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
purposes okay so it okay I'm just trying
 
00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:34.200 align:start position:0%
to wrap my brain around how this money
 
00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
can be spent thank you y so it's been a
 
00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
while since we've all gotten together
 
00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
and uh I just want to remind everyone
 
00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:46.640 align:start position:0%
that um I I think the style that this
 
00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
committee has adopted is that once you
 
00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:52.760 align:start position:0%
start to ask questions as long as you're
 
00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
being consistent and and being
 
00:20:58.430 --> 00:20:58.440 align:start position:0%
respectful of boundaries um you just
 
00:21:01.149 --> 00:21:01.159 align:start position:0%
keep talking U let's have a conversation
 
00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
and not you know not not go back and
 
00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:06.440 align:start position:0%
forth on the formality of it let's just
 
00:21:09.789 --> 00:21:09.799 align:start position:0%
talk okay okay um your turn to talk
 
00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
again great thank you and I think a lot
 
00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
of questions could very well be answered
 
00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
in some of the uh points in the
 
00:21:18.549 --> 00:21:18.559 align:start position:0%
presentation on slide
 
00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:21.240 align:start position:0%
four uh within the statutory framework
 
00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:23.320 align:start position:0%
State tan of programs provide a range of
 
00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:25.240 align:start position:0%
benefits and services that can serve as
 
00:21:27.269 --> 00:21:27.279 align:start position:0%
critical support to families who are
 
00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
experiencing economic hardships
 
00:21:31.669 --> 00:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
including the provision of cash cash
 
00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
assistance if we as we mentioned
 
00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
employment and training assistance and
 
00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:38.360 align:start position:0%
other related services such as emergency
 
00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
assistance as reflected in the state's
 
00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:46.200 align:start position:0%
plan to avoid incurring penalties under
 
00:21:49.149 --> 00:21:49.159 align:start position:0%
federal law a state must meet Moe
 
00:21:51.909 --> 00:21:51.919 align:start position:0%
requirements each fiscal year that is
 
00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:54.640 align:start position:0%
the expenditure of State funds in tanif
 
00:21:56.669 --> 00:21:56.679 align:start position:0%
or a separate State program for certain
 
00:21:59.590 --> 00:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
benefits and services
 
00:22:01.549 --> 00:22:01.559 align:start position:0%
also was established in federal law each
 
00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
state must expend funds that meet a tan
 
00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
of purpose for eligible families in an
 
00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:11.080 align:start position:0%
amount equal to or at least 80% of State
 
00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:14.440 align:start position:0%
spending from fiscal year
 
00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:17.720 align:start position:0%
1994 this required amount can fall to
 
00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
75% if the state meets its tan of work
 
00:22:24.549 --> 00:22:24.559 align:start position:0%
participation requirement for the fiscal
 
00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
year work participation rates measure
 
00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
the degree to which a state engages with
 
00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:32.200 align:start position:0%
families to receive assistance that are
 
00:22:35.669 --> 00:22:35.679 align:start position:0%
funded by tanif ore and work activities
 
00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
specified under federal law a state
 
00:22:40.549 --> 00:22:40.559 align:start position:0%
faces Financial penalty for a fiscal
 
00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
year if it does not meet the work
 
00:22:46.149 --> 00:22:46.159 align:start position:0%
overall work participation rate of
 
00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
50% New Hampshire currently has a
 
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:59.230 align:start position:0%
 
good

00:22:59.230 --> 00:22:59.240 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:23:03.149 --> 00:23:03.159 align:start position:0%
okay I'm sure the definition of a two
 
00:23:06.029 --> 00:23:06.039 align:start position:0%
parent family is in the statute
 
00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:08.440 align:start position:0%
somewhere um would it
 
00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:10.630 align:start position:0%
somewhere um would it
include

00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
include
 
00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:14.200 align:start position:0%
um a couple male female couple
 
00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
childbearing age um that does not have a
 
00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:26.149 --> 00:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
parenting I don't uh yeah actually I
 
00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
think it I think it would
 
00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:30.760 align:start position:0%
but I would have to follow up on that
 
00:23:32.789 --> 00:23:32.799 align:start position:0%
would you please because one of the
 
00:23:35.669 --> 00:23:35.679 align:start position:0%
challenges I think the state has is that
 
00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:38.240 align:start position:0%
we don't have enough foster parents in
 
00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:38.950 align:start position:0%
we don't have enough foster parents in
the

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
system and if there is some employment
 
00:23:46.029 --> 00:23:46.039 align:start position:0%
Assistance or job training you know
 
00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe we could figure out how to
 
00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:50.840 align:start position:0%
get these programs to be a little
 
00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:52.390 align:start position:0%
get these programs to be a little
complimentary

00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
complimentary
 
00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah and as I understand it so
 
00:23:56.909 --> 00:23:56.919 align:start position:0%
differentiating between foster care or
 
00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:00.520 align:start position:0%
kinship care so for kinship individuals
 
00:24:04.149 --> 00:24:04.159 align:start position:0%
who are related or can certainly apply
 
00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:07.640 align:start position:0%
for the tanif benefit um otherwise
 
00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:09.720 align:start position:0%
specifically just foster parents who are
 
00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
not related to the child would not
 
00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:15.480 align:start position:0%
qualify for T of funding you're you're
 
00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:17.480 align:start position:0%
probably right could you could you just
 
00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:20.320 align:start position:0%
verify that in the next week or two or
 
00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:27.440 align:start position:0%
hurry um so so then it would go without
 
00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:29.230 align:start position:0%
hurry um so so then it would go without
saying

00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:29.240 align:start position:0%
saying
 
00:24:33.389 --> 00:24:33.399 align:start position:0%
that a couple wishing to have a child
 
00:24:36.789 --> 00:24:36.799 align:start position:0%
would not be eligible until what point
 
00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
until there's a confirmed pregnancy or
 
00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
confirmed birth no birth and deprivation
 
00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:47.240 align:start position:0%
of one or both parents segregation
 
00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:49.480 align:start position:0%
deprivation say say the word again
 
00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:53.240 align:start position:0%
deprivation oh deprivation poverty or
 
00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
something deprivation of one or both
 
00:24:56.760 --> 00:25:00.149 align:start position:0%
something deprivation of one or both
parents

00:25:00.149 --> 00:25:00.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:00.159 --> 00:25:03.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:07.360 align:start position:0%
thanks yeah represent
 
00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:10.120 align:start position:0%
wner thank you I just wondered if you
 
00:25:12.909 --> 00:25:12.919 align:start position:0%
could maybe just really briefly touch on
 
00:25:17.149 --> 00:25:17.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
programs sure um I can provide certainly
 
00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
the the state's policy on with the
 
00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
criteria for emergency assistance if
 
00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:40.440 align:start position:0%
okay so on Slide Five you would ask for
 
00:25:42.389 --> 00:25:42.399 align:start position:0%
a bit of the history both Federal and
 
00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
for the State of New Hampshire oop
 
00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:49.000 align:start position:0%
sorry what is the FY
 
00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:52.600 align:start position:0%
94 level that we're based off
 
00:25:56.669 --> 00:25:56.679 align:start position:0%
of uh the school year 9
 
00:25:59.510 --> 00:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
UM do we have that for maintenance of
 
00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
effort 32 oh yeah the 32 million for
 
00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
maintenance of effort that's
 
00:26:09.149 --> 00:26:09.159 align:start position:0%
the that was the baseline from FY 94 yes
 
00:26:09.159 --> 00:26:13.350 align:start position:0%
the that was the baseline from FY 94 yes
thank

00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
you so again on Slide Five uh a little
 
00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:18.440 align:start position:0%
bit of the history I'm not going to go
 
00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
through each of these but I have
 
00:26:23.269 --> 00:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
provided really some of the key events
 
00:26:26.549 --> 00:26:26.559 align:start position:0%
uh in history for the federal program uh
 
00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
one that I would draw draw your
 
00:26:31.149 --> 00:26:31.159 align:start position:0%
attention to really uh that is key is
 
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
the personal responsibility and work
 
00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:37.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity reconciliation Act of
 
00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
1996 otherwise known as pora you may
 
00:26:44.669 --> 00:26:44.679 align:start position:0%
hear it pronounced by its acronym that
 
00:26:47.909 --> 00:26:47.919 align:start position:0%
uh Act created the tanif program and
 
00:26:50.149 --> 00:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
repealed a former program known as the
 
00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:52.520 align:start position:0%
aid to families with dependent
 
00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:54.320 align:start position:0%
children I don't want to interrupt you
 
00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:55.960 align:start position:0%
but I'd like to understand this a more
 
00:26:58.389 --> 00:26:58.399 align:start position:0%
clearly so back on
 
00:26:59.669 --> 00:26:59.679 align:start position:0%
whatever slide you talked about you said
 
00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:03.480 align:start position:0%
the maintenance of effort $32
 
00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:05.480 align:start position:0%
million and down here you're talking
 
00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:09.720 align:start position:0%
about it's being 30% of some number 1994
 
00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
does that mean 1994 number is three and
 
00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
a tenth or three and a third times as
 
00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
much as $38 million that we're working
 
00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
million yeah the 30% is what can be
 
00:27:29.909 --> 00:27:29.919 align:start position:0%
transferred to the other programs that's
 
00:27:31.669 --> 00:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
not what I'm asking about sorry so on
 
00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:35.200 align:start position:0%
slide four under two avoid
 
00:27:39.149 --> 00:27:39.159 align:start position:0%
penalties it references 75 to
 
00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
80% of State spending in fiscal year
 
00:27:46.029 --> 00:27:46.039 align:start position:0%
1994 so what I'm trying to understand is
 
00:27:49.909 --> 00:27:49.919 align:start position:0%
what was State spending in fiscal year
 
00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
1994 for
 
00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
afdc that is the 32
 
00:28:00.549 --> 00:28:00.559 align:start position:0%
million the that's what we spent in 1994
 
00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
yes so
 
00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:06.240 align:start position:0%
so if I may interject representative
 
00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
Earth so we spent slightly more than
 
00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:10.640 align:start position:0%
that but the $32 million that
 
00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
maintenance of effort that was set in
 
00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
law back in the90s that has never
 
00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:16.440 align:start position:0%
changed so basically our maintenance of
 
00:28:17.909 --> 00:28:17.919 align:start position:0%
effort the amount that we have to spend
 
00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
every year to get the 38 million has not
 
00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
changed at all and so the federally set
 
00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
level of 78 75 to 80% so I I I would
 
00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:30.640 align:start position:0%
need to just back into the number with a
 
00:28:31.909 --> 00:28:31.919 align:start position:0%
calculator to understand what the
 
00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:35.720 align:start position:0%
spending was in 1984 but but the the 32
 
00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
million is the percentage of that so it
 
00:28:40.509 --> 00:28:40.519 align:start position:0%
it would have been probably closer to 39
 
00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:46.760 align:start position:0%
million okay yeah does that help it
 
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
true a follow yeah related I think I
 
00:28:56.389 --> 00:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
seem to remember we're um we were
 
00:28:57.950 --> 00:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
talking about why to put in a certain
 
00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
amount into the budget for Tana from the
 
00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
state when we had so much unspent and my
 
00:29:06.789 --> 00:29:06.799 align:start position:0%
my um recollection was that if we didn't
 
00:29:08.549 --> 00:29:08.559 align:start position:0%
put in that much the amount of federal
 
00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
funds would decrease permanently that we
 
00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:14.240 align:start position:0%
had to continue to do the 32 million a
 
00:29:17.230 --> 00:29:17.240 align:start position:0%
year or we'd have a permanent reduction
 
00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:19.000 align:start position:0%
in the amount of federal money being put
 
00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:22.720 align:start position:0%
into this program and at least am I kind
 
00:29:26.789 --> 00:29:26.799 align:start position:0%
of close yes yes so um I believe it was
 
00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:28.600 align:start position:0%
during the Governor's phase some of the
 
00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:31.000 align:start position:0%
money that we had set aside for tanif to
 
00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:33.080 align:start position:0%
meet that maintenance of effort was
 
00:29:35.509 --> 00:29:35.519 align:start position:0%
reduced and then during the house phase
 
00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:37.480 align:start position:0%
some of those funds were added back into
 
00:29:39.509 --> 00:29:39.519 align:start position:0%
this budget to make sure that we could
 
00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:43.480 align:start position:0%
spend that $32 million because um as uh
 
00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:46.360 align:start position:0%
Karen had indicated earlier 15% of this
 
00:29:49.549 --> 00:29:49.559 align:start position:0%
can be spent on administrative costs so
 
00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
some of this pays for positions but if
 
00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
those positions are vacant then we can't
 
00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
actually earn that that maintenance of
 
00:29:58.710 --> 00:29:58.720 align:start position:0%
effort so to speak or if cash assistance
 
00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:01.640 align:start position:0%
decreases you know um we can't earn that
 
00:30:03.549 --> 00:30:03.559 align:start position:0%
maintenance of effort but yes that was
 
00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:05.640 align:start position:0%
all part of that discussion and it's not
 
00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
that it's permanently gone it's that we
 
00:30:09.389 --> 00:30:09.399 align:start position:0%
have to pay a penalty and then the
 
00:30:11.029 --> 00:30:11.039 align:start position:0%
subsequent year there'll also be a
 
00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:12.640 align:start position:0%
reduction in the federal funds that are
 
00:30:14.669 --> 00:30:14.679 align:start position:0%
coming forward so it's almost um this
 
00:30:16.149 --> 00:30:16.159 align:start position:0%
isn't a technical term but it's almost
 
00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
like a double whammy so to
 
00:30:22.149 --> 00:30:22.159 align:start position:0%
speak yeah thanks that's that's kind of
 
00:30:25.909 --> 00:30:25.919 align:start position:0%
what I remember yep that's precisely
 
00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:32.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:37.269 --> 00:30:37.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:41.080 align:start position:0%
coffee so on the history uh Slide the
 
00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
federal history slide it's Slide Five um
 
00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
the personal responsibility and work
 
00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity reconciliation act referred
 
00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:53.880 align:start position:0%
to commonly is Pera uh which had created
 
00:30:57.430 --> 00:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
the tanif program uh which Pro so so
 
00:31:00.149 --> 00:31:00.159 align:start position:0%
tanif does as I mentioned provide the uh
 
00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
fixed block grant and for all states
 
00:31:05.669 --> 00:31:05.679 align:start position:0%
that's about 16.5
 
00:31:09.029 --> 00:31:09.039 align:start position:0%
billion to States and territories of
 
00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
Interest the tanif annual funding has
 
00:31:15.269 --> 00:31:15.279 align:start position:0%
never been adjusted for inflation in its
 
00:31:18.789 --> 00:31:18.799 align:start position:0%
27-year history and is now worth almost
 
00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:27.880 align:start position:0%
created okay that that I'm sure that's a
 
00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
great math stat um what I always want to
 
00:31:34.549 --> 00:31:34.559 align:start position:0%
translate those kinds of statements to
 
00:31:37.549 --> 00:31:37.559 align:start position:0%
is what is happening to the workload
 
00:31:41.269 --> 00:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
measurements are are we are we seeing uh
 
00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
a significant decline in the workload
 
00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
that's being funded and is the decline
 
00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
in the workload sufficient to where
 
00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:52.440 align:start position:0%
we're causing real problems that we can
 
00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:55.120 align:start position:0%
identify specifically I mean it's one
 
00:31:58.190 --> 00:31:58.200 align:start position:0%
thing to say we're spending less than
 
00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
half but it's another to say and the
 
00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:04.600 align:start position:0%
impact of that in human terms is the
 
00:32:07.909 --> 00:32:07.919 align:start position:0%
following are you able to articulate the
 
00:32:09.549 --> 00:32:09.559 align:start position:0%
second part of that when you say
 
00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
workload I assume you're meaning
 
00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:13.960 align:start position:0%
workload and what the human impact is of
 
00:32:17.389 --> 00:32:17.399 align:start position:0%
having probably reduced
 
00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
workload so I I would have to you know
 
00:32:23.029 --> 00:32:23.039 align:start position:0%
really conduct quite a bit of an
 
00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
analysis on that for the last several
 
00:32:29.389 --> 00:32:29.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:32.549 --> 00:32:32.559 align:start position:0%
okay um I think that would be difficult
 
00:32:36.549 --> 00:32:36.559 align:start position:0%
to really pinpoint the cause for any
 
00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:38.840 align:start position:0%
shift in workload because there are many
 
00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
influencing factors for the tan of Grant
 
00:32:43.389 --> 00:32:43.399 align:start position:0%
but also the
 
00:32:46.029 --> 00:32:46.039 align:start position:0%
participation uh of uh or the
 
00:32:54.029 --> 00:32:54.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
program you know we just have a simple
 
00:32:58.629 --> 00:32:58.639 align:start position:0%
decision here you know when it comes our
 
00:33:03.269 --> 00:33:03.279 align:start position:0%
turn we either provide x million or Y
 
00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
million or Z million and really what we
 
00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
ought to be doing is an analysis of of
 
00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
what the state is getting for its return
 
00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
on investment and that's got to be tied
 
00:33:17.629 --> 00:33:17.639 align:start position:0%
somehow to workload and human impact I
 
00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
think I can say that you know from the
 
00:33:22.509 --> 00:33:22.519 align:start position:0%
top of my head I mean we've certainly
 
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
shifted the focus over the last decade
 
00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
or more uh on the the the uh level of
 
00:33:37.470 --> 00:33:37.480 align:start position:0%
um initiatives and programs that we have
 
00:33:40.389 --> 00:33:40.399 align:start position:0%
strengthened over the years specifically
 
00:33:43.629 --> 00:33:43.639 align:start position:0%
to get people uh the support that they
 
00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
need to find not just find a job but to
 
00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:51.480 align:start position:0%
be able to keep that job or basically
 
00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
more focusing on upskilling people
 
00:33:57.909 --> 00:33:57.919 align:start position:0%
towards career and career lack ladders
 
00:33:59.389 --> 00:33:59.399 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot that we and I'm going
 
00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
to talk about that in a few minutes but
 
00:34:03.549 --> 00:34:03.559 align:start position:0%
there's a lot that we are shifting the
 
00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
focus for uh with respect to the New
 
00:34:08.829 --> 00:34:08.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire employment program uh as we
 
00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
see um you know a bit of an evolution or
 
00:34:16.030 --> 00:34:16.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
will representative wer a significant
 
00:34:21.790 --> 00:34:21.800 align:start position:0%
number in my mind if if we're spending
 
00:34:24.349 --> 00:34:24.359 align:start position:0%
by inflation only 50% of what we spent
 
00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
those many years ago would be the size
 
00:34:29.430 --> 00:34:29.440 align:start position:0%
of the populations from that that period
 
00:34:31.829 --> 00:34:31.839 align:start position:0%
of time to the populations now and if
 
00:34:34.389 --> 00:34:34.399 align:start position:0%
the population has decreased then we're
 
00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
looking at a successful program so
 
00:34:39.829 --> 00:34:39.839 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm really interested in
 
00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:41.800 align:start position:0%
have the number of people we helped in
 
00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:44.240 align:start position:0%
in 1990 four
 
00:34:48.149 --> 00:34:48.159 align:start position:0%
1996 has that population decreased or
 
00:34:50.109 --> 00:34:50.119 align:start position:0%
increased that that particular
 
00:34:52.589 --> 00:34:52.599 align:start position:0%
population has decreased over the last
 
00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
decade and I have a slide that I'm going
 
00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
to show you at least the last three
 
00:34:58.829 --> 00:34:58.839 align:start position:0%
years so you can see it's relatively
 
00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
steady probably over the last five or
 
00:35:04.349 --> 00:35:04.359 align:start position:0%
six years um but uh definitely decreased
 
00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
over a longer term which I would see as
 
00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
program on slide six you will see the uh
 
00:35:20.069 --> 00:35:20.079 align:start position:0%
States history of TANF more or less at a
 
00:35:21.589 --> 00:35:21.599 align:start position:0%
a glance I'm not going to go through all
 
00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
of these but you will note again in
 
00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:27.320 align:start position:0%
1996 the enactment of prora
 
00:35:31.349 --> 00:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
um and uh some events uh that uh came
 
00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:33.240 align:start position:0%
after that for New Hampshire I'm happy
 
00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:37.720 align:start position:0%
to dive into any of them if you would
 
00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:42.200 align:start position:0%
like otherwise I'll move to slide
 
00:35:45.349 --> 00:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
seven you had asked about the misuse of
 
00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
Tana of funds that may be known to us in
 
00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:50.680 align:start position:0%
other states I will first preface that
 
00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:52.440 align:start position:0%
by explaining that the federal
 
00:35:54.750 --> 00:35:54.760 align:start position:0%
government does have an obligation to
 
00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
set out in regulations CR IIA that it
 
00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:00.680 align:start position:0%
will use in carrying out its authority
 
00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:03.960 align:start position:0%
to enforce certain tanif
 
00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:06.280 align:start position:0%
Provisions by assessing penalties in
 
00:36:09.069 --> 00:36:09.079 align:start position:0%
cases where Tana of funds were spent for
 
00:36:09.079 --> 00:36:10.670 align:start position:0%
cases where Tana of funds were spent for
unallowable

00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
unallowable
 
00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
activities I can tell you that in 2020
 
00:36:16.109 --> 00:36:16.119 align:start position:0%
charges were brought against six State
 
00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
officials for misappropriation of tan of
 
00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:22.960 align:start position:0%
funds New Hampshire is not one of them
 
00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
in Mississippi there are eight criminal
 
00:36:27.950 --> 00:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
defendants and 4 seven civil defendants
 
00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:30.200 align:start position:0%
at the moment that the Miss Mississippi
 
00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:33.240 align:start position:0%
Department of Human Services is suing in
 
00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:36.280 align:start position:0%
an attempt to recoup $77 million in
 
00:36:39.589 --> 00:36:39.599 align:start position:0%
stolen or misspent federal
 
00:36:42.069 --> 00:36:42.079 align:start position:0%
funds in New Hampshire the state
 
00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:45.640 align:start position:0%
legislature had P passed a law outlining
 
00:36:48.109 --> 00:36:48.119 align:start position:0%
penalties to be applied if cash
 
00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
assistance recipients were found to have
 
00:36:53.349 --> 00:36:53.359 align:start position:0%
conducted electronic benefit
 
00:36:56.990 --> 00:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
transactions or EBT at restricted Loc
 
00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:00.280 align:start position:0%
locations and now attempts to use EBT
 
00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
cards at certain business types is
 
00:37:07.589 --> 00:37:07.599 align:start position:0%
blocked so are the close by ATMs uh to
 
00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
these establishments this includes the
 
00:37:13.630 --> 00:37:13.640 align:start position:0%
liquor store Casino or gaming in uh
 
00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
establishments retail establishments
 
00:37:17.829 --> 00:37:17.839 align:start position:0%
that provide adult oriented
 
00:37:21.349 --> 00:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
entertainment smoke shops tattoo parlers
 
00:37:23.069 --> 00:37:23.079 align:start position:0%
and marijuana
 
00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
dispensaries regardless of this the EBT
 
00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
administ rator in the state monitors the
 
00:37:32.109 --> 00:37:32.119 align:start position:0%
transactions in cases where an
 
00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:35.440 align:start position:0%
individual is sanctioned the retailer is
 
00:37:37.829 --> 00:37:37.839 align:start position:0%
also reported to the authorities or
 
00:37:41.470 --> 00:37:41.480 align:start position:0%
whichever governing body oversees
 
00:37:44.309 --> 00:37:44.319 align:start position:0%
them lastly on the slide the public
 
00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
assistance reporting information system
 
00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
yes sir okay so I was listening to your
 
00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:54.040 align:start position:0%
list of places where the ATMs may be you
 
00:37:56.270 --> 00:37:56.280 align:start position:0%
know shut suspended or shut down from
 
00:37:59.309 --> 00:37:59.319 align:start position:0%
the program um and they were all kind of
 
00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
making sense to me uh until I heard you
 
00:38:05.109 --> 00:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
talk about medicinal marijuana medicinal
 
00:38:07.790 --> 00:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
marijuana is not considered a vice it's
 
00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:13.560 align:start position:0%
a considered um you know me medicine so
 
00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
uh what what is what would be the
 
00:38:17.790 --> 00:38:17.800 align:start position:0%
distinct and maybe you can't answer this
 
00:38:21.109 --> 00:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
now but I'd be interested in you know
 
00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:23.640 align:start position:0%
John Williams or somebody explaining to
 
00:38:27.349 --> 00:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
me what the legal distinction with be to
 
00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
allow a lawful service to be shut down
 
00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
based on what seems to me to be a
 
00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:39.200 align:start position:0%
presumption of of
 
00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
abuse so um you know the strip clubs and
 
00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:45.440 align:start position:0%
the rest I'm you know that's that all
 
00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
makes sense but the um medicinal pot is
 
00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:52.480 align:start position:0%
different in New Hampshire I'd be happy
 
00:38:55.069 --> 00:38:55.079 align:start position:0%
to look into that all right thank
 
00:38:57.349 --> 00:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
you yeah
 
00:38:59.150 --> 00:38:59.160 align:start position:0%
I do have one comment on that and that
 
00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:01.960 align:start position:0%
is that medicinal marijuana is illegal
 
00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:05.240 align:start position:0%
federally and um we're using federal
 
00:39:10.589 --> 00:39:10.599 align:start position:0%
funds so um so even though it's a legal
 
00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
activity uh within the state it's still
 
00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:15.160 align:start position:0%
there's still some reach of the federal
 
00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
government uh here in the program so you
 
00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
sir are brilliant uh and it'll be
 
00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
interesting to see if your answer gets
 
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
confirmed but yeah that's a good thought
 
00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:27.109 align:start position:0%
confirmed but yeah that's a good thought
thanks

00:39:27.109 --> 00:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:28.720 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
here so the uh Paris system um provides
 
00:39:36.829 --> 00:39:36.839 align:start position:0%
data to States regarding recipients of
 
00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:38.720 align:start position:0%
Public Assistance who are receiving
 
00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:41.560 align:start position:0%
either duplicate benefits uh in two or
 
00:39:45.430 --> 00:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
more States for the calendar year of
 
00:39:48.430 --> 00:39:48.440 align:start position:0%
2023 there were four individuals in New
 
00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire on the New Hampshire Paris
 
00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:53.000 align:start position:0%
report who were found to be in violation
 
00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:55.720 align:start position:0%
of receiving duplicate tan of benefits
 
00:39:58.230 --> 00:39:58.240 align:start position:0%
in two or more our
 
00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:02.680 align:start position:0%
states we take action then uh regarding
 
00:40:08.109 --> 00:40:08.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:10.640 align:start position:0%
individuals so have you completed your
 
00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
list of other states and abuse yes okay
 
00:40:16.829 --> 00:40:16.839 align:start position:0%
so let me let me tell you why that
 
00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
question came up I we all have friends
 
00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:20.470 align:start position:0%
question came up I we all have friends
and

00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:20.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:40:24.309 --> 00:40:24.319 align:start position:0%
family one of mine works for uh a
 
00:40:27.069 --> 00:40:27.079 align:start position:0%
different State's um t
 
00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
program and while we were you know
 
00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:32.680 align:start position:0%
spending time together over the holidays
 
00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
this is the kind of conversation my
 
00:40:37.829 --> 00:40:37.839 align:start position:0%
family has so so don't you know it's not
 
00:40:44.109 --> 00:40:44.119 align:start position:0%
too horrible but um if um he he alleged
 
00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
that there's a tremendous amount of
 
00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:49.640 align:start position:0%
fraud waste and abuse rampant in this
 
00:40:52.589 --> 00:40:52.599 align:start position:0%
program around the country and he and
 
00:40:54.750 --> 00:40:54.760 align:start position:0%
when he suggested that I you know hold a
 
00:40:56.910 --> 00:40:56.920 align:start position:0%
hearing something like this
 
00:40:59.069 --> 00:40:59.079 align:start position:0%
he said to really try to focus on that
 
00:41:02.069 --> 00:41:02.079 align:start position:0%
because there are examples of States
 
00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:04.720 align:start position:0%
having attempted to spend money in
 
00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
inappropriate ways and it would just be
 
00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
nice if we're able to identify those
 
00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
guard rails a little bit better for the
 
00:41:15.309 --> 00:41:15.319 align:start position:0%
future if we were able to do that that's
 
00:41:17.950 --> 00:41:17.960 align:start position:0%
not urgent but it would be something
 
00:41:21.349 --> 00:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
nice to know uh when we get our bite
 
00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:22.680 align:start position:0%
back at the
 
00:41:28.309 --> 00:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
Apple okay okay thank you slide
 
00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:31.240 align:start position:0%
eight just at a high level these are the
 
00:41:33.630 --> 00:41:33.640 align:start position:0%
key tanif eligibility criteria in New
 
00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:35.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there's certainly more detail
 
00:41:36.990 --> 00:41:37.000 align:start position:0%
behind this and I'm not going to go
 
00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
through each one of these but just to
 
00:41:45.430 --> 00:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:47.790 --> 00:41:47.800 align:start position:0%
that slide
 
00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
sorry so regarding the group size
 
00:41:59.309 --> 00:41:59.319 align:start position:0%
um what group is that referring to as a
 
00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:00.640 align:start position:0%
group of one doesn't seem like it would
 
00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
include a child unless it's only the
 
00:42:05.550 --> 00:42:05.560 align:start position:0%
child what are we talking about there so
 
00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:10.240 align:start position:0%
for example if that child has um both
 
00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
parents um the child is not living with
 
00:42:15.790 --> 00:42:15.800 align:start position:0%
either parent that child may be
 
00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:18.200 align:start position:0%
considered as a group of
 
00:42:20.910 --> 00:42:20.920 align:start position:0%
one so in that situation the child still
 
00:42:24.829 --> 00:42:24.839 align:start position:0%
qualifies for Tan so going back to the
 
00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
um f parent thing so you could have
 
00:42:30.910 --> 00:42:30.920 align:start position:0%
foster parents where the child qualifies
 
00:42:35.589 --> 00:42:35.599 align:start position:0%
is that no the the the child has to be
 
00:42:35.599 --> 00:42:37.150 align:start position:0%
is that no the the the child has to be
related

00:42:37.150 --> 00:42:37.160 align:start position:0%
related
 
00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
to the parent who would be receiving the
 
00:42:44.349 --> 00:42:44.359 align:start position:0%
benefit by either blood marriage or
 
00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
adoption and actually this past
 
00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
legislative session we also added courta
 
00:42:52.990 --> 00:42:53.000 align:start position:0%
appointed Guardians is qualifying for
 
00:42:55.349 --> 00:42:55.359 align:start position:0%
the tanif grant basically for those
 
00:42:58.069 --> 00:42:58.079 align:start position:0%
individuals who are taking in children
 
00:43:00.750 --> 00:43:00.760 align:start position:0%
that they're not related to at all and
 
00:43:02.549 --> 00:43:02.559 align:start position:0%
that number of parent or that number of
 
00:43:05.390 --> 00:43:05.400 align:start position:0%
individuals is increasing in the state
 
00:43:07.150 --> 00:43:07.160 align:start position:0%
so if they have been court appointed as
 
00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
a guardian of a child they will now
 
00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:13.480 align:start position:0%
qualify for the tanif program okay so go
 
00:43:15.069 --> 00:43:15.079 align:start position:0%
back to the not not that case let's go
 
00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
back to the family
 
00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
case I'm try still trying to understand
 
00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
how a child qualify as independent of
 
00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
their blood related
 
00:43:27.109 --> 00:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
parents because it may be a grandparent
 
00:43:28.750 --> 00:43:28.760 align:start position:0%
for example who is applying for the
 
00:43:30.910 --> 00:43:30.920 align:start position:0%
benefit on behalf of the
 
00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
child and their income doesn't
 
00:43:35.309 --> 00:43:35.319 align:start position:0%
necessarily count whereas the parents
 
00:43:35.319 --> 00:43:36.589 align:start position:0%
necessarily count whereas the parents
would

00:43:36.589 --> 00:43:36.599 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
you slide nine digs in a bit for the
 
00:43:51.549 --> 00:43:51.559 align:start position:0%
cash assistance grant this is the last
 
00:43:54.190 --> 00:43:54.200 align:start position:0%
uh two and a half
 
00:43:59.589 --> 00:43:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
Grant so the 29 million uh figure you
 
00:44:06.309 --> 00:44:06.319 align:start position:0%
see at the bottom is the projected
 
00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
expenditure of the grant for the end of
 
00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:22.750 --> 00:44:22.760 align:start position:0%
year Jess uh do you have a question go
 
00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
ahead so there's a time limit of five
 
00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:29.160 align:start position:0%
five 16 months what happens after that
 
00:44:31.230 --> 00:44:31.240 align:start position:0%
point to the
 
00:44:35.230 --> 00:44:35.240 align:start position:0%
family to the the recipient yes well to
 
00:44:36.549 --> 00:44:36.559 align:start position:0%
the receipt of to them to the yeah
 
00:44:37.630 --> 00:44:37.640 align:start position:0%
receipt of the
 
00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:41.160 align:start position:0%
funding it it ends the 5 five years is
 
00:44:44.950 --> 00:44:44.960 align:start position:0%
the term limit time limit forever for
 
00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
that individual yes it's a fiveyear
 
00:44:50.430 --> 00:44:50.440 align:start position:0%
lifetime limit so somebody may receive
 
00:44:53.470 --> 00:44:53.480 align:start position:0%
tan of for like say a year uh then for
 
00:44:56.030 --> 00:44:56.040 align:start position:0%
some reason their case closes then they
 
00:44:58.549 --> 00:44:58.559 align:start position:0%
come back and reapply later so it's a
 
00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:03.480 align:start position:0%
lifetime limit okay how many people age
 
00:45:06.430 --> 00:45:06.440 align:start position:0%
out there a record of that uh we
 
00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
probably do I can get that for you if
 
00:45:09.790 --> 00:45:09.800 align:start position:0%
you want to know yeah be curious as to
 
00:45:12.190 --> 00:45:12.200 align:start position:0%
what you know percentage Yeah we would
 
00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:16.200 align:start position:0%
have um a record of how many um cases
 
00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
Clos their tanif benefit because of a
 
00:45:24.030 --> 00:45:24.040 align:start position:0%
child aging out
 
00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:26.480 align:start position:0%
okay are child or family right not
 
00:45:29.589 --> 00:45:29.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:33.160 align:start position:0%
child or is this only to children I me
 
00:45:34.910 --> 00:45:34.920 align:start position:0%
the family with the children yeah based
 
00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:42.800 align:start position:0%
child based on age or number of
 
00:45:45.829 --> 00:45:45.839 align:start position:0%
years so I think what you're asking is
 
00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
if a parent is receiving the TANF
 
00:45:51.390 --> 00:45:51.400 align:start position:0%
benefit then it goes to a grandparent so
 
00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:54.040 align:start position:0%
the Money Follows the child I get that
 
00:45:55.549 --> 00:45:55.559 align:start position:0%
but let's just take a straight family
 
00:45:58.710 --> 00:45:58.720 align:start position:0%
with a a child and they're on
 
00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
tan so they're a group of more than one
 
00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
there may be a group of three let's say
 
00:46:07.069 --> 00:46:07.079 align:start position:0%
mhm after five years that family is done
 
00:46:10.829 --> 00:46:10.839 align:start position:0%
well one child may be then no longer
 
00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:12.640 align:start position:0%
receiving that benefit but if there are
 
00:46:14.190 --> 00:46:14.200 align:start position:0%
other children in the household
 
00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:16.720 align:start position:0%
depending on when they particularly were
 
00:46:19.309 --> 00:46:19.319 align:start position:0%
started into the benefit let's say the
 
00:46:21.870 --> 00:46:21.880 align:start position:0%
second or third child wasn't born yet
 
00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
okay so when we count group size are we
 
00:46:26.589 --> 00:46:26.599 align:start position:0%
only counting
 
00:46:29.829 --> 00:46:29.839 align:start position:0%
children in the group or are we counting
 
00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
the parents no that that that's the the
 
00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
household basically as long as they're
 
00:46:37.150 --> 00:46:37.160 align:start position:0%
parents and children that's all you
 
00:46:38.349 --> 00:46:38.359 align:start position:0%
count you don't count grandparents you
 
00:46:43.349 --> 00:46:43.359 align:start position:0%
don't count correct okay yes yes okay I
 
00:46:45.829 --> 00:46:45.839 align:start position:0%
know it's very
 
00:46:48.270 --> 00:46:48.280 align:start position:0%
confusing slide 10 provide you with the
 
00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:51.240 align:start position:0%
case count oh sorry over the last two
 
00:46:52.270 --> 00:46:52.280 align:start position:0%
and a half
 
00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
years go
 
00:46:57.470 --> 00:46:57.480 align:start position:0%
ahead can you just clarify so we're
 
00:47:00.109 --> 00:47:00.119 align:start position:0%
talking about a time limit of five years
 
00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
is there a
 
00:47:04.910 --> 00:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
um a monetary limit to the amount am I
 
00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
reading this correctly that it's $5,000
 
00:47:12.190 --> 00:47:12.200 align:start position:0%
or that so uh yeah the resource limit so
 
00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:14.640 align:start position:0%
if they have resources assets basically
 
00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:16.640 align:start position:0%
or access to resources the limit is
 
00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
5,000 for uh individuals who are
 
00:47:22.589 --> 00:47:22.599 align:start position:0%
receiving the benefit now for if you're
 
00:47:24.510 --> 00:47:24.520 align:start position:0%
brand new and first applying for the
 
00:47:27.349 --> 00:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
benefit that limit is
 
00:47:30.030 --> 00:47:30.040 align:start position:0%
$1,000 so if you gained resources while
 
00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
you were receiving TANF when you come up
 
00:47:33.549 --> 00:47:33.559 align:start position:0%
for your
 
00:47:36.430 --> 00:47:36.440 align:start position:0%
redetermination that resource limit then
 
00:47:38.270 --> 00:47:38.280 align:start position:0%
changes to
 
00:47:41.390 --> 00:47:41.400 align:start position:0%
5,000 okay thank
 
00:47:45.230 --> 00:47:45.240 align:start position:0%
you so if you have a you have a child uh
 
00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
that that qualifies is on the program
 
00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:49.880 align:start position:0%
for two years parents leave the state
 
00:47:52.030 --> 00:47:52.040 align:start position:0%
leave the child with the grandparents
 
00:47:54.670 --> 00:47:54.680 align:start position:0%
they they apply again now it's the
 
00:47:56.430 --> 00:47:56.440 align:start position:0%
grandparents and the one child now group
 
00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
of one is that um is the clock start
 
00:48:02.230 --> 00:48:02.240 align:start position:0%
over again or is that now third
 
00:48:04.910 --> 00:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
year I believe that would be the third
 
00:48:07.109 --> 00:48:07.119 align:start position:0%
year then for that child because it is
 
00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
following the child not the adult
 
00:48:16.190 --> 00:48:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
you may ask another questions but but
 
00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
I'm going to follow up on that for you
 
00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:24.880 align:start position:0%
okay one one question sort of related to
 
00:48:27.630 --> 00:48:27.640 align:start position:0%
what I was thinking terms of a um a max
 
00:48:30.790 --> 00:48:30.800 align:start position:0%
amount is there's a 5year time limit or
 
00:48:32.790 --> 00:48:32.800 align:start position:0%
a counter let's say is there a max
 
00:48:35.309 --> 00:48:35.319 align:start position:0%
amount of benefit that um a group can
 
00:48:37.069 --> 00:48:37.079 align:start position:0%
receive a family can receive a child can
 
00:48:40.230 --> 00:48:40.240 align:start position:0%
receive it's 60% of federal poverty
 
00:48:42.829 --> 00:48:42.839 align:start position:0%
level depending on the household size
 
00:48:45.270 --> 00:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
but it's 60% of that
 
00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
level that is their
 
00:48:52.349 --> 00:48:52.359 align:start position:0%
payment okay so there's not a specific
 
00:48:55.710 --> 00:48:55.720 align:start position:0%
um point where they max out you 've
 
00:48:57.230 --> 00:48:57.240 align:start position:0%
gotten the most amount of money we can't
 
00:48:59.950 --> 00:48:59.960 align:start position:0%
give you any more you can't no because
 
00:49:02.349 --> 00:49:02.359 align:start position:0%
it basically follows the time limit okay
 
00:49:09.870 --> 00:49:09.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:12.789 --> 00:49:12.799 align:start position:0%
you uh just make sure I understand these
 
00:49:16.030 --> 00:49:16.040 align:start position:0%
numbers here the 729 going up to 1500
 
00:49:19.510 --> 00:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
that's based on what time period
 
00:49:21.829 --> 00:49:21.839 align:start position:0%
monthly income that is yeah that is
 
00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
monthly income thank
 
00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:30.069 align:start position:0%
monthly income thank
you

00:49:30.069 --> 00:49:30.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:32.589 --> 00:49:32.599 align:start position:0%
Jess yeah I'm I'm just a little thick
 
00:49:35.349 --> 00:49:35.359 align:start position:0%
here so our group size as long as
 
00:49:38.549 --> 00:49:38.559 align:start position:0%
there's one child and blood related
 
00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
parents that it's the it's the count of
 
00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
the children plus the blood related
 
00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
parents that determines the group size
 
00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:47.200 align:start position:0%
so Mom and Dad and two kids would get
 
00:49:49.470 --> 00:49:49.480 align:start position:0%
would four be500
 
00:49:53.109 --> 00:49:53.119 align:start position:0%
bucks well you wouldn't so we don't do
 
00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
uh we haven't done the tanif um benefit
 
00:49:57.829 --> 00:49:57.839 align:start position:0%
for two parent families uh in New
 
00:50:01.349 --> 00:50:01.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we focus on the one parent
 
00:50:05.349 --> 00:50:05.359 align:start position:0%
soly marri sorry yeah Minor Detail um
 
00:50:11.710 --> 00:50:11.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:13.829 --> 00:50:13.839 align:start position:0%
um okay just to make sure okay we'll go
 
00:50:16.710 --> 00:50:16.720 align:start position:0%
with one parent then so one parent three
 
00:50:19.230 --> 00:50:19.240 align:start position:0%
children gets
 
00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:21.150 align:start position:0%
children gets
$1,500

00:50:21.150 --> 00:50:21.160 align:start position:0%
$1,500
 
00:50:24.109 --> 00:50:24.119 align:start position:0%
correct no parent so
 
00:50:30.510 --> 00:50:30.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
12:43 I will confirm that for you thank
 
00:50:36.349 --> 00:50:36.359 align:start position:0%
you I I just want to make sure because
 
00:50:37.870 --> 00:50:37.880 align:start position:0%
it is Trick some of the rules are really
 
00:50:40.109 --> 00:50:40.119 align:start position:0%
tricky around tanif so let me just
 
00:50:47.230 --> 00:50:47.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:49.829 --> 00:50:49.839 align:start position:0%
thanks all right so what I what I think
 
00:50:53.630 --> 00:50:53.640 align:start position:0%
I just heard you say is that in New
 
00:50:57.030 --> 00:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we've not had an experience
 
00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
with a group that includes a child and
 
00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:01.990 align:start position:0%
with a group that includes a child and
two

00:51:01.990 --> 00:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:51:06.349 --> 00:51:06.359 align:start position:0%
parents we've we've had apparently many
 
00:51:09.829 --> 00:51:09.839 align:start position:0%
groups with a child and with a parent
 
00:51:13.109 --> 00:51:13.119 align:start position:0%
but none with two parents and given that
 
00:51:15.549 --> 00:51:15.559 align:start position:0%
it's one of the if I heard you wrong
 
00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
then just tell me I'm wrong but but if I
 
00:51:20.829 --> 00:51:20.839 align:start position:0%
heard you right and we go back to the
 
00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
very beginning of one some of the
 
00:51:24.510 --> 00:51:24.520 align:start position:0%
objectives of this program it's to
 
00:51:27.589 --> 00:51:27.599 align:start position:0%
support two parent families and it just
 
00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
makes me wonder if we're missing the
 
00:51:33.390 --> 00:51:33.400 align:start position:0%
mark somehow if that's a stated
 
00:51:36.430 --> 00:51:36.440 align:start position:0%
strategic objective but we don't have
 
00:51:40.750 --> 00:51:40.760 align:start position:0%
any experience helping any of those
 
00:51:44.230 --> 00:51:44.240 align:start position:0%
families if my memory serves correctly I
 
00:51:47.670 --> 00:51:47.680 align:start position:0%
think we've did two parent households in
 
00:51:52.230 --> 00:51:52.240 align:start position:0%
the past I think up until probably the
 
00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:53.430 align:start position:0%
the past I think up until probably the
mid

00:51:53.430 --> 00:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
mid
 
00:51:57.069 --> 00:51:57.079 align:start position:0%
2000s um but that program then we
 
00:51:59.230 --> 00:51:59.240 align:start position:0%
stopped doing two parent families and
 
00:52:01.589 --> 00:52:01.599 align:start position:0%
focused just on one I don't know why
 
00:52:01.599 --> 00:52:05.950 align:start position:0%
focused just on one I don't know why
that

00:52:05.950 --> 00:52:05.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:09.030 --> 00:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
was I'm sorry I couldn't hear
 
00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:12.640 align:start position:0%
you so why did it stop I I don't know
 
00:52:16.109 --> 00:52:16.119 align:start position:0%
that okay but I can find out okay I you
 
00:52:19.030 --> 00:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
know I just think it's it's important in
 
00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
the sense that so so many social
 
00:52:27.069 --> 00:52:27.079 align:start position:0%
statistics indicate that children do
 
00:52:32.270 --> 00:52:32.280 align:start position:0%
better in families that have two adults
 
00:52:34.309 --> 00:52:34.319 align:start position:0%
helping take care of them in the
 
00:52:37.390 --> 00:52:37.400 align:start position:0%
household so whether they're male female
 
00:52:39.670 --> 00:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
whatever it doesn't much matter as long
 
00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
as you got two committed adults trying
 
00:52:46.750 --> 00:52:46.760 align:start position:0%
to raise a family that matters and so I
 
00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
would just like to make sure that we're
 
00:52:52.870 --> 00:52:52.880 align:start position:0%
not um underperforming because we're
 
00:52:55.829 --> 00:52:55.839 align:start position:0%
failing to identify
 
00:52:57.549 --> 00:52:57.559 align:start position:0%
one of the best things we can do to
 
00:53:00.750 --> 00:53:00.760 align:start position:0%
improve the lives of our kids so so if
 
00:53:03.349 --> 00:53:03.359 align:start position:0%
you could go back and check I will do
 
00:53:06.430 --> 00:53:06.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:11.109 align:start position:0%
 
youc

00:53:11.109 --> 00:53:11.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:11.119 --> 00:53:15.950 align:start position:0%
 
particip

00:53:15.950 --> 00:53:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:19.270 --> 00:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
they well it it it's also supposed to
 
00:53:25.510 --> 00:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
support um job training right so so so
 
00:53:28.309 --> 00:53:28.319 align:start position:0%
you I think you've accurately quoted uh
 
00:53:31.630 --> 00:53:31.640 align:start position:0%
an income but there's I think there's
 
00:53:34.270 --> 00:53:34.280 align:start position:0%
more to this program if I'm learning
 
00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
right but all right do you have anything
 
00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:39.270 align:start position:0%
right but all right do you have anything
else

00:53:39.270 --> 00:53:39.280 align:start position:0%
else
 
00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
representative okay go
 
00:53:44.430 --> 00:53:44.440 align:start position:0%
ahead so I am on slide
 
00:53:47.910 --> 00:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
10 that provides you with the case count
 
00:53:49.990 --> 00:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
over the last two and a half years and
 
00:53:51.789 --> 00:53:51.799 align:start position:0%
you'll see that it's been as I said
 
00:53:56.390 --> 00:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
earlier fairly steady
 
00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:06.870 --> 00:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
cases okay so um my my accounting brain
 
00:54:10.109 --> 00:54:10.119 align:start position:0%
wants to take this graph and be able to
 
00:54:13.430 --> 00:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
break it down to the number of programs
 
00:54:16.829 --> 00:54:16.839 align:start position:0%
that are being funded by these by this
 
00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
cumulative line item so so like for
 
00:54:24.430 --> 00:54:24.440 align:start position:0%
example at the outset of July we're just
 
00:54:28.589 --> 00:54:28.599 align:start position:0%
short of 2800 case count it would be
 
00:54:32.670 --> 00:54:32.680 align:start position:0%
nice to know if that 2800
 
00:54:35.630 --> 00:54:35.640 align:start position:0%
represented 20 different programs that
 
00:54:38.309 --> 00:54:38.319 align:start position:0%
get some funding or if this is all one
 
00:54:40.829 --> 00:54:40.839 align:start position:0%
the same program this is just cash
 
00:54:45.230 --> 00:54:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:47.910 align:start position:0%
 
program

00:54:47.910 --> 00:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:54:52.109 --> 00:54:52.119 align:start position:0%
okay and what percentage of that 70
 
00:54:54.069 --> 00:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
million does this
 
00:54:54.079 --> 00:54:59.069 align:start position:0%
million does this
represent

00:54:59.069 --> 00:54:59.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:03.030 --> 00:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
okay it it feels like a small
 
00:55:05.910 --> 00:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
percentage it's a it's a big
 
00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:08.640 align:start position:0%
percentage because this is this is
 
00:55:11.270 --> 00:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
monthly it's not half but I think it's
 
00:55:13.549 --> 00:55:13.559 align:start position:0%
37th whatever that is
 
00:55:17.150 --> 00:55:17.160 align:start position:0%
so okay 42% something like
 
00:55:22.109 --> 00:55:22.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:25.789 --> 00:55:25.799 align:start position:0%
right um representative Edwards so cash
 
00:55:29.109 --> 00:55:29.119 align:start position:0%
assistance is just some really quick
 
00:55:30.910 --> 00:55:30.920 align:start position:0%
back of the envelope math here probably
 
00:55:30.920 --> 00:55:32.109 align:start position:0%
back of the envelope math here probably
about

00:55:32.109 --> 00:55:32.119 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:55:36.470 --> 00:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
40 40 some odd percent of of total tanif
 
00:55:39.150 --> 00:55:39.160 align:start position:0%
expenditures thank thanks if later on if
 
00:55:41.430 --> 00:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
you guys think that it's a different
 
00:55:43.990 --> 00:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
number just let me know um no no it's
 
00:55:46.870 --> 00:55:46.880 align:start position:0%
it's about 20 in uh State fiscal year 23
 
00:55:50.390 --> 00:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
it was about $27 million total oh all
 
00:55:52.549 --> 00:55:52.559 align:start position:0%
right thank you you're welcome you you
 
00:55:57.150 --> 00:55:57.160 align:start position:0%
can continue without temporary
 
00:55:59.829 --> 00:55:59.839 align:start position:0%
Interruption okay I'm going to move on
 
00:56:04.470 --> 00:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
to slide 11 you asked me about audits
 
00:56:07.390 --> 00:56:07.400 align:start position:0%
for the State uh So currently there is a
 
00:56:10.750 --> 00:56:10.760 align:start position:0%
KPMG audit uh in progress for fiscal
 
00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:12.150 align:start position:0%
KPMG audit uh in progress for fiscal
year

00:56:12.150 --> 00:56:12.160 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:56:15.069 --> 00:56:15.079 align:start position:0%
23 and I have listed on this Slide the
 
00:56:19.589 --> 00:56:19.599 align:start position:0%
findings from the the KPMG audit in
 
00:56:22.589 --> 00:56:22.599 align:start position:0%
22 it's my understanding that none of
 
00:56:26.349 --> 00:56:26.359 align:start position:0%
these are critical level findings uh and
 
00:56:28.510 --> 00:56:28.520 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to describe
 
00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
any a little bit more detail to any of
 
00:56:32.789 --> 00:56:32.799 align:start position:0%
them if you're interested I'm going to
 
00:56:34.990 --> 00:56:35.000 align:start position:0%
turn to representative wer who's our
 
00:56:37.990 --> 00:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
resident audit expert any of these jump
 
00:56:41.470 --> 00:56:41.480 align:start position:0%
out at you sir I haven't read any
 
00:56:44.589 --> 00:56:44.599 align:start position:0%
these might be done internally might be
 
00:56:46.069 --> 00:56:46.079 align:start position:0%
done internally but they don't come
 
00:56:46.079 --> 00:56:48.069 align:start position:0%
done internally but they don't come
before

00:56:48.069 --> 00:56:48.079 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:50.720 align:start position:0%
fiscal so which is
 
00:56:53.190 --> 00:56:53.200 align:start position:0%
unusual so I I know there's a lot of
 
00:56:55.390 --> 00:56:55.400 align:start position:0%
audits you do within the department
 
00:56:58.029 --> 00:56:58.039 align:start position:0%
we don't see them
 
00:57:02.150 --> 00:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
all I guess they're available yes maybe
 
00:57:05.670 --> 00:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
we'll ask for more of them at at budget
 
00:57:07.789 --> 00:57:07.799 align:start position:0%
time or maybe we ask Kevin to put them
 
00:57:11.069 --> 00:57:11.079 align:start position:0%
on the we the LBA
 
00:57:13.069 --> 00:57:13.079 align:start position:0%
website where the audits are I'm not
 
00:57:14.829 --> 00:57:14.839 align:start position:0%
sure these would necessarily be LBA
 
00:57:16.230 --> 00:57:16.240 align:start position:0%
conducted audits that we're talking
 
00:57:19.230 --> 00:57:19.240 align:start position:0%
about I think internal to the department
 
00:57:21.230 --> 00:57:21.240 align:start position:0%
y I understand that you can you not post
 
00:57:24.589 --> 00:57:24.599 align:start position:0%
them for us um I can look into that we
 
00:57:26.990 --> 00:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
just generally only post our own audits
 
00:57:29.630 --> 00:57:29.640 align:start position:0%
online though um but I can I can see
 
00:57:31.750 --> 00:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
what we can do okay or are they
 
00:57:33.309 --> 00:57:33.319 align:start position:0%
available on your
 
00:57:35.670 --> 00:57:35.680 align:start position:0%
website I don't think we post them
 
00:57:37.750 --> 00:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
either but I can certainly make
 
00:57:41.910 --> 00:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:44.510 --> 00:57:44.520 align:start position:0%
you I I think I might have just learned
 
00:57:47.630 --> 00:57:47.640 align:start position:0%
something else which is I I had assumed
 
00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:48.430 align:start position:0%
something else which is I I had assumed
that

00:57:48.430 --> 00:57:48.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:57:52.710 --> 00:57:52.720 align:start position:0%
all thirdparty audits that come into the
 
00:57:57.029 --> 00:57:57.039 align:start position:0%
state have to go sort of through the uh
 
00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
checkin of our audit team that the our
 
00:58:03.710 --> 00:58:03.720 align:start position:0%
audit team is supposed to at least be
 
00:58:07.349 --> 00:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
aware and a recipient of the results
 
00:58:09.789 --> 00:58:09.799 align:start position:0%
that there that we don't have
 
00:58:12.630 --> 00:58:12.640 align:start position:0%
independent audits at the state level do
 
00:58:15.710 --> 00:58:15.720 align:start position:0%
we or well we have we have a a busy
 
00:58:18.870 --> 00:58:18.880 align:start position:0%
audit team and there's about 30 people
 
00:58:22.309 --> 00:58:22.319 align:start position:0%
but they they have a cycle where they do
 
00:58:24.470 --> 00:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
almost every Department every five years
 
00:58:28.109 --> 00:58:28.119 align:start position:0%
and performance audits has requested and
 
00:58:29.990 --> 00:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
the number of audits it would take in
 
00:58:31.430 --> 00:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
00:58:34.630 --> 00:58:34.640 align:start position:0%
Services 20% of their work basically is
 
00:58:36.589 --> 00:58:36.599 align:start position:0%
done with contractors I suppose they
 
00:58:40.470 --> 00:58:40.480 align:start position:0%
have a method to um audit those
 
00:58:42.549 --> 00:58:42.559 align:start position:0%
contractors but it doesn't come through
 
00:58:44.950 --> 00:58:44.960 align:start position:0%
our audit division it goes through their
 
00:58:49.029 --> 00:58:49.039 align:start position:0%
own internal so we would have to request
 
00:58:52.430 --> 00:58:52.440 align:start position:0%
to see those um and it' probably be a
 
00:58:56.109 --> 00:58:56.119 align:start position:0%
good idea at at uh budget time to be
 
00:58:58.109 --> 00:58:58.119 align:start position:0%
asking for them all up front but you
 
00:59:01.150 --> 00:59:01.160 align:start position:0%
might see a pile like that
 
00:59:03.789 --> 00:59:03.799 align:start position:0%
right we have several weeks before we
 
00:59:05.870 --> 00:59:05.880 align:start position:0%
actually ever get
 
00:59:09.349 --> 00:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
the the governor's budget though
 
00:59:12.750 --> 00:59:12.760 align:start position:0%
so all right we would see at this
 
00:59:15.670 --> 00:59:15.680 align:start position:0%
session I I think we're on slide
 
00:59:17.670 --> 00:59:17.680 align:start position:0%
12 very
 
00:59:21.510 --> 00:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
well so current trends in the TANF
 
00:59:24.870 --> 00:59:24.880 align:start position:0%
program you had asked about so from
 
00:59:27.630 --> 00:59:27.640 align:start position:0%
first from a federal perspective the
 
00:59:29.109 --> 00:59:29.119 align:start position:0%
federal government is committed to
 
00:59:30.990 --> 00:59:31.000 align:start position:0%
ensuring that states are accountable for
 
00:59:34.150 --> 00:59:34.160 align:start position:0%
meeting tanif requirements so re a
 
00:59:36.910 --> 00:59:36.920 align:start position:0%
review of State spending patterns has
 
00:59:39.069 --> 00:59:39.079 align:start position:0%
led them to consider legislative or
 
00:59:41.589 --> 00:59:41.599 align:start position:0%
regulatory remedies to ensure that
 
00:59:44.589 --> 00:59:44.599 align:start position:0%
states are not using any flexibilities
 
00:59:47.230 --> 00:59:47.240 align:start position:0%
to avoid tanif requirements or otherwise
 
00:59:50.190 --> 00:59:50.200 align:start position:0%
undermine the statutory goals of the
 
00:59:53.750 --> 00:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
program State programs have shifted away
 
00:59:56.789 --> 00:59:56.799 align:start position:0%
from the focus on Direct Cash and
 
00:59:59.309 --> 00:59:59.319 align:start position:0%
employment assistance although states
 
01:00:01.029 --> 01:00:01.039 align:start position:0%
are permitted under the statute to
 
01:00:03.950 --> 01:00:03.960 align:start position:0%
determine how much funding to expend on
 
01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:04.829 align:start position:0%
determine how much funding to expend on
cash

01:00:04.829 --> 01:00:04.839 align:start position:0%
cash
 
01:00:06.950 --> 01:00:06.960 align:start position:0%
assistance the administration for
 
01:00:09.270 --> 01:00:09.280 align:start position:0%
children and family families reminds us
 
01:00:11.630 --> 01:00:11.640 align:start position:0%
that there is a large body of research
 
01:00:13.270 --> 01:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
that shows cash assistance is a
 
01:00:15.630 --> 01:00:15.640 align:start position:0%
critically important tool for reducing
 
01:00:18.670 --> 01:00:18.680 align:start position:0%
Family and Child poverty and recipients
 
01:00:20.390 --> 01:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
are less likely to be involved in the
 
01:00:21.710 --> 01:00:21.720 align:start position:0%
child welfare
 
01:00:23.829 --> 01:00:23.839 align:start position:0%
system despite the evidence that it
 
01:00:26.870 --> 01:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
reduces child and family poverty cash
 
01:00:29.630 --> 01:00:29.640 align:start position:0%
assistance in 2020 this is on a national
 
01:00:32.910 --> 01:00:32.920 align:start position:0%
level accounted for less than 23% of tan
 
01:00:39.309 --> 01:00:39.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:41.789 --> 01:00:41.799 align:start position:0%
1997 the federal government also
 
01:00:43.910 --> 01:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
believes that states are under investing
 
01:00:45.950 --> 01:00:45.960 align:start position:0%
in work Education and Training for
 
01:00:48.390 --> 01:00:48.400 align:start position:0%
parents with low incomes as well as
 
01:00:50.789 --> 01:00:50.799 align:start position:0%
critical work
 
01:00:53.029 --> 01:00:53.039 align:start position:0%
supports as a result the office of
 
01:00:55.829 --> 01:00:55.839 align:start position:0%
family assistance has taken actions to
 
01:00:58.630 --> 01:00:58.640 align:start position:0%
in the form of a uh pending notice of
 
01:01:01.230 --> 01:01:01.240 align:start position:0%
proposed rul making there's seven
 
01:01:04.150 --> 01:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
components to that proposed rule uh I
 
01:01:06.190 --> 01:01:06.200 align:start position:0%
will just mention the the the first
 
01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:09.240 align:start position:0%
three of them one to establish a ceiling
 
01:01:12.190 --> 01:01:12.200 align:start position:0%
on the term needy so that it may not
 
01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
exceed a family income of 200% of
 
01:01:17.589 --> 01:01:17.599 align:start position:0%
federal federal poverty
 
01:01:21.190 --> 01:01:21.200 align:start position:0%
guidelines in 2024 the federal poverty
 
01:01:25.710 --> 01:01:25.720 align:start position:0%
level at 200% for an individual ual is
 
01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:27.549 align:start position:0%
level at 200% for an individual ual is
$29,100

01:01:27.549 --> 01:01:27.559 align:start position:0%
$29,100
 
01:01:33.230 --> 01:01:33.240 align:start position:0%
for family of four it's 60,000 660,000
 
01:01:35.470 --> 01:01:35.480 align:start position:0%
which is not very
 
01:01:38.910 --> 01:01:38.920 align:start position:0%
much determining when an expenditure is
 
01:01:41.230 --> 01:01:41.240 align:start position:0%
reasonably calculated to accomplish a
 
01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
tan of purpose is another uh uh section
 
01:01:47.950 --> 01:01:47.960 align:start position:0%
of the proposed
 
01:01:51.670 --> 01:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
Rule and third they are proposing to
 
01:01:54.549 --> 01:01:54.559 align:start position:0%
exclude third-party non-governmental
 
01:01:59.630 --> 01:01:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:03.670 --> 01:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
effort can I ask a question go ahead
 
01:02:23.349 --> 01:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:26.549 --> 01:02:26.559 align:start position:0%
underinvestigated on
 
01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
that I what I would like to do is wait
 
01:02:32.910 --> 01:02:32.920 align:start position:0%
for the national proposed rule making to
 
01:02:35.029 --> 01:02:35.039 align:start position:0%
see or the the proposed rule making just
 
01:02:37.870 --> 01:02:37.880 align:start position:0%
to see what that comes out looking like
 
01:02:41.230 --> 01:02:41.240 align:start position:0%
if we're looking at um the F federal
 
01:02:46.589 --> 01:02:46.599 align:start position:0%
poverty level of uh 200% for
 
01:02:50.230 --> 01:02:50.240 align:start position:0%
families I we can definitely look at our
 
01:02:53.230 --> 01:02:53.240 align:start position:0%
own rule which we currently set at 60%
 
01:02:55.069 --> 01:02:55.079 align:start position:0%
of federal poverty level
 
01:02:56.269 --> 01:02:56.279 align:start position:0%
I me I guess I could ask a question a
 
01:02:58.390 --> 01:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
different way this analysis which the
 
01:03:00.430 --> 01:03:00.440 align:start position:0%
federal government did must have had
 
01:03:03.309 --> 01:03:03.319 align:start position:0%
some metrics for determining the states
 
01:03:08.670 --> 01:03:08.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:22.789 align:start position:0%
 
underinvestigated

01:03:22.789 --> 01:03:22.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:27.710 --> 01:03:27.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:29.470 --> 01:03:29.480 align:start position:0%
so this is really late in the game for
 
01:03:31.990 --> 01:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
me to mention this but I
 
01:03:34.390 --> 01:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
assume Mr White that you're keeping
 
01:03:37.109 --> 01:03:37.119 align:start position:0%
track of the questions and we're going
 
01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
to get answers back yes we're keeping
 
01:03:42.630 --> 01:03:42.640 align:start position:0%
track all right it's just been a while
 
01:03:45.589 --> 01:03:45.599 align:start position:0%
since we've done this
 
01:03:49.630 --> 01:03:49.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:53.710 --> 01:03:53.720 align:start position:0%
notes so using the Tana of funds um New
 
01:03:56.589 --> 01:03:56.599 align:start position:0%

initiatives in

2021 there was published a pretty

comprehensive economic analysis study uh
 
01:06:20.150 --> 01:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
that basically gave us recommendations
 
01:06:21.950 --> 01:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
of ways the state could look at
 
01:06:25.549 --> 01:06:25.559 align:start position:0%

one of those initiatives which we have
 
01:06:30.309 --> 01:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
implemented is a pilot program a
 
01:06:32.950 --> 01:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
two-year pilot program that provides for
 
01:06:34.309 --> 01:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
an optional

enter new employment or take a
 
01:07:00.710 --> 01:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
promotion the pilot program began in
 
01:07:03.390 --> 01:07:03.400 align:start position:0%
October of 22 and it lasts through
 
01:07:04.789 --> 01:07:04.799 align:start position:0%
September of
 
01:07:07.910 --> 01:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
24 the intent is to incentivize more
 
01:07:10.269 --> 01:07:10.279 align:start position:0%
households to work and increase their
 
01:07:13.309 --> 01:07:13.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:16.309 --> 01:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
Savings in the last legislative session
 
01:07:18.990 --> 01:07:19.000 align:start position:0%
we were uh provided with authority and
 
01:07:22.190 --> 01:07:22.200 align:start position:0%
some funding to continue that particular
 
01:07:25.589 --> 01:07:25.599 align:start position:0%
economic study and and that is ongoing
 
01:07:28.230 --> 01:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
now at this time with the intent to look
 
01:07:31.950 --> 01:07:31.960 align:start position:0%
at uh further uh mitigation strategies
 
01:07:33.870 --> 01:07:33.880 align:start position:0%
for the cliff effect but also to
 
01:07:36.670 --> 01:07:36.680 align:start position:0%
consider graduated assistance programs
 
01:07:39.109 --> 01:07:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:41.589 --> 01:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
state I am expecting that we'll be able
 
01:07:43.829 --> 01:07:43.839 align:start position:0%
to report back to the legislature this
 
01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:50.269 --> 01:07:50.279 align:start position:0%
report do you know who you might be
 
01:07:53.150 --> 01:07:53.160 align:start position:0%
reporting that to HHS oversight or
 
01:07:57.029 --> 01:07:57.039 align:start position:0%

01:08:04.589 --> 01:08:04.599 align:start position:0%
earlier these are Services focused on

preventative Services so here's where
 
01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
you had asked me earlier about the focus
 
01:08:42.870 --> 01:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
on two three and four in the tan of
 
01:08:45.309 --> 01:08:45.319 align:start position:0%

01:09:44.349 --> 01:09:44.359 align:start position:0%
question do you have to know what
 
01:09:46.070 --> 01:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
section that was in h did you say that
 
01:09:49.110 --> 01:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
was this year 2023 hb2 M yes you know
 
01:09:50.470 --> 01:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
what section it
 
01:09:53.510 --> 01:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
is yes I do I can I can find that for
 
01:09:54.870 --> 01:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
you you so I
 
01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:58.390 align:start position:0%
you you so I
don't

01:09:58.390 --> 01:09:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:00.910 --> 01:10:00.920 align:start position:0%
okay there are like three or four any
 
01:10:06.510 --> 01:10:06.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:10.030 --> 01:10:10.040 align:start position:0%
immigrants what was that word recent
 
01:10:13.590 --> 01:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
immigrants in other words if if
 
01:10:17.110 --> 01:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
uh someone can move here from overseas
 
01:10:20.189 --> 01:10:20.199 align:start position:0%
and immediately go on this
 
01:10:22.750 --> 01:10:22.760 align:start position:0%
assistance so that would be the uh
 
01:10:24.149 --> 01:10:24.159 align:start position:0%
likely the refugee
 
01:10:27.390 --> 01:10:27.400 align:start position:0%
assistance program um I can get you more
 
01:10:29.270 --> 01:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
information specifically the policy on
 
01:10:31.149 --> 01:10:31.159 align:start position:0%
that program in New
 
01:10:34.270 --> 01:10:34.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because it
 
01:10:39.229 --> 01:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
the federal U Ser service seems to be oh
 
01:10:42.189 --> 01:10:42.199 align:start position:0%
you've haven't spent all your money on
 
01:10:44.430 --> 01:10:44.440 align:start position:0%
on needy families will'll send you more
 
01:10:47.430 --> 01:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
from Mexico or wherever they come in
 
01:10:50.149 --> 01:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
from um that's what's happening in some
 
01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:55.750 align:start position:0%
 
states

01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:03.590 --> 01:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:06.630 --> 01:11:06.640 align:start position:0%
13 so New Hampshire's focus on the
 
01:11:09.229 --> 01:11:09.239 align:start position:0%
future really our duty to align the
 
01:11:11.830 --> 01:11:11.840 align:start position:0%
department policy and our it systems
 
01:11:14.510 --> 01:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
with the fiscal responsibility Act of
 
01:11:17.870 --> 01:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
2023 that is one Focus for New Hampshire
 
01:11:20.350 --> 01:11:20.360 align:start position:0%
it includes changes to what data states
 
01:11:23.229 --> 01:11:23.239 align:start position:0%
can use for the work participation rate
 
01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
uh provides for new mandated reports and
 
01:11:28.070 --> 01:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
it gives us an opportunity to
 
01:11:30.750 --> 01:11:30.760 align:start position:0%
participate in a six-year pilot program
 
01:11:33.470 --> 01:11:33.480 align:start position:0%
to look at different Statewide
 
01:11:36.149 --> 01:11:36.159 align:start position:0%
performance metrics in lie of the work
 
01:11:38.629 --> 01:11:38.639 align:start position:0%
participation rate work participation
 
01:11:40.390 --> 01:11:40.400 align:start position:0%
rate really doesn't tell us about
 
01:11:43.070 --> 01:11:43.080 align:start position:0%
outcomes for families so we want to take
 
01:11:45.149 --> 01:11:45.159 align:start position:0%
a look at what other metrics may be
 
01:11:48.310 --> 01:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
available and worthwhile for collecting
 
01:11:49.790 --> 01:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
data that's what the federal government
 
01:11:51.629 --> 01:11:51.639 align:start position:0%
is interested in
 
01:11:56.030 --> 01:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
yes so uh Meredith Tellus I think is her
 
01:11:59.310 --> 01:11:59.320 align:start position:0%
last name is is uh I know that she's
 
01:12:03.189 --> 01:12:03.199 align:start position:0%

01:12:07.390 --> 01:12:07.400 align:start position:0%
on contract metrics performance metrics
 
01:12:10.790 --> 01:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
is is she sharing any bandwidth with you
 
01:12:14.629 --> 01:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
to to take a look at uh any benchmarks
 
01:12:16.870 --> 01:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
that that you all may have in the for
 
01:12:19.229 --> 01:12:19.239 align:start position:0%
the future programs we would likely
 
01:12:21.870 --> 01:12:21.880 align:start position:0%
engage with her and her team if we are
 
01:12:24.030 --> 01:12:24.040 align:start position:0%
selected for that particular pilot there
 
01:12:25.510 --> 01:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
are only five states that will be
 
01:12:27.750 --> 01:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
selected uh the application process
 
01:12:29.550 --> 01:12:29.560 align:start position:0%
hasn't started yet but we intend to
 
01:12:34.270 --> 01:12:34.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:37.189 --> 01:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
you uh another focus is known as the
 
01:12:40.629 --> 01:12:40.639 align:start position:0%
whole family's approach to jobs
 
01:12:44.590 --> 01:12:44.600 align:start position:0%
initiative uh this was launched in 2017
 
01:12:46.790 --> 01:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
led by the administration for Children
 
01:12:49.510 --> 01:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
and Families it began as a New England
 
01:12:51.790 --> 01:12:51.800 align:start position:0%
initiative focused on bringing together
 
01:12:54.310 --> 01:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
a broad range of stakeholders ERS to
 
01:12:56.830 --> 01:12:56.840 align:start position:0%
create lasting change to our state
 
01:12:59.430 --> 01:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
programs and policies placing families
 
01:13:01.830 --> 01:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
at the center and offering a connection
 
01:13:04.950 --> 01:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
to Regional and and federal Partners uh
 
01:13:08.310 --> 01:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
to address intergenerational poverty and
 
01:13:10.470 --> 01:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
contribute to the state's economic
 
01:13:15.390 --> 01:13:15.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:18.669 --> 01:13:18.679 align:start position:0%
prosperity in the 2023 legislative
 
01:13:20.669 --> 01:13:20.679 align:start position:0%
session I mentioned how the department
 
01:13:23.790 --> 01:13:23.800 align:start position:0%
was authorized to continue that 202
 
01:13:26.149 --> 01:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
economic analysis regarding the cliff
 
01:13:28.669 --> 01:13:28.679 align:start position:0%
effect and conduct a study of graduated
 
01:13:31.110 --> 01:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
assistance programs for New Hampshire so
 
01:13:34.950 --> 01:13:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:37.350 --> 01:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
focuses and if you will I would like to
 
01:13:39.709 --> 01:13:39.719 align:start position:0%
close by sharing some words from two
 
01:13:42.990 --> 01:13:43.000 align:start position:0%
different tanif recipients very
 
01:13:45.390 --> 01:13:45.400 align:start position:0%
briefly tanif income I received has
 
01:13:47.830 --> 01:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
helped my family tremendously this month
 
01:13:50.149 --> 01:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
I was able to pay my electric off so I
 
01:13:52.910 --> 01:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
have a zero balance at this time which I
 
01:13:54.709 --> 01:13:54.719 align:start position:0%
don't think I I've ever been completely
 
01:13:58.189 --> 01:13:58.199 align:start position:0%
abled or caught up with my electric I
 
01:14:00.189 --> 01:14:00.199 align:start position:0%
also was able to pay my car payment and
 
01:14:02.910 --> 01:14:02.920 align:start position:0%
insurance on time I have not had to
 
01:14:05.030 --> 01:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
reach out for resources to help with
 
01:14:07.270 --> 01:14:07.280 align:start position:0%
food like I usually do at the end of the
 
01:14:09.790 --> 01:14:09.800 align:start position:0%
month even with a class picnic and two
 
01:14:12.669 --> 01:14:12.679 align:start position:0%
field trips that required packed lunches
 
01:14:15.110 --> 01:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
my son was in need of new shoes as he
 
01:14:16.790 --> 01:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
had been wearing the same pair since
 
01:14:19.390 --> 01:14:19.400 align:start position:0%
before school had started 12-year-old
 
01:14:22.629 --> 01:14:22.639 align:start position:0%
boys aren't gentle with anything I was
 
01:14:24.629 --> 01:14:24.639 align:start position:0%
able to buy a new pair with money I had
 
01:14:26.750 --> 01:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
put aside for emergencies and it felt
 
01:14:28.950 --> 01:14:28.960 align:start position:0%
good to be able to provide him provide
 
01:14:30.870 --> 01:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
him with them in hopes that they last a
 
01:14:33.070 --> 01:14:33.080 align:start position:0%
little bit longer this time those are
 
01:14:34.709 --> 01:14:34.719 align:start position:0%
just a few examples of how the tan of
 
01:14:37.350 --> 01:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
income has helped my
 
01:14:41.189 --> 01:14:41.199 align:start position:0%
family a work participant in the nhp
 
01:14:43.629 --> 01:14:43.639 align:start position:0%
program says that this has been a
 
01:14:46.830 --> 01:14:46.840 align:start position:0%
lifechanging uh event for her she notes
 
01:14:48.790 --> 01:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
that transitioning into a new job and
 
01:14:51.070 --> 01:14:51.080 align:start position:0%
now having money come in has made her
 
01:14:53.270 --> 01:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
life easier she notes that she's been
 
01:14:54.990 --> 01:14:55.000 align:start position:0%
been able to support her children and
 
01:14:57.669 --> 01:14:57.679 align:start position:0%
actually have money she notes this
 
01:15:00.629 --> 01:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
program made the transition into working
 
01:15:03.030 --> 01:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
easier it also allowed her to view and
 
01:15:05.390 --> 01:15:05.400 align:start position:0%
change her spending habits she notes
 
01:15:07.430 --> 01:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
that she was a pretty heavy smoker and
 
01:15:09.709 --> 01:15:09.719 align:start position:0%
quit before beginning this
 
01:15:12.229 --> 01:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
career with having less stress over
 
01:15:14.310 --> 01:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
finances she chose to do that and this
 
01:15:16.870 --> 01:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
has made a significant difference in her
 
01:15:18.950 --> 01:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
budgeting she feels that this would not
 
01:15:21.189 --> 01:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
have happened without this program the
 
01:15:22.629 --> 01:15:22.639 align:start position:0%
program has allowed her to not have to
 
01:15:27.510 --> 01:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:34.629 --> 01:15:34.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:37.510 --> 01:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
you could you talk a little bit about
 
01:15:40.629 --> 01:15:40.639 align:start position:0%
housing and I mean you look at the the
 
01:15:43.229 --> 01:15:43.239 align:start position:0%
incomes that what we're allowing people
 
01:15:48.430 --> 01:15:48.440 align:start position:0%
to have um and this none of these would
 
01:15:50.790 --> 01:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
be able to um be able to afford an
 
01:15:54.709 --> 01:15:54.719 align:start position:0%
apartment in conquered so how do we keep
 
01:15:57.390 --> 01:15:57.400 align:start position:0%
these families housed uh with these
 
01:16:01.750 --> 01:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
small um very small I benefits that
 
01:16:04.030 --> 01:16:04.040 align:start position:0%
we're paying them sure and I'm not sure
 
01:16:06.430 --> 01:16:06.440 align:start position:0%
I can answer the question directly but I
 
01:16:09.270 --> 01:16:09.280 align:start position:0%
can certainly provide other information
 
01:16:10.750 --> 01:16:10.760 align:start position:0%
I can go back and get you some other
 
01:16:13.790 --> 01:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
information we do work with the Bureau
 
01:16:15.910 --> 01:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
of housing or Bureau of homeless
 
01:16:18.470 --> 01:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
Services it changed last year the name
 
01:16:21.350 --> 01:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
of it and focus of it is really on
 
01:16:23.629 --> 01:16:23.639 align:start position:0%
homelessness um but we also work very
 
01:16:25.910 --> 01:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
closely with the New Hampshire uh house
 
01:16:28.870 --> 01:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
Finance Authority uh to address some of
 
01:16:31.229 --> 01:16:31.239 align:start position:0%
these issues which is all a part of that
 
01:16:35.270 --> 01:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
whole fam's for jobs uh approach to jobs
 
01:16:38.950 --> 01:16:38.960 align:start position:0%
rather um so there's there's a lot of
 
01:16:41.270 --> 01:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
collaboration that is going on because
 
01:16:43.709 --> 01:16:43.719 align:start position:0%
we're really looking at not just housing
 
01:16:46.590 --> 01:16:46.600 align:start position:0%
but child care as you know is uh
 
01:16:52.070 --> 01:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
certainly a very expensive um uh cost
 
01:16:54.110 --> 01:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
for families in New Hampshire so we're
 
01:16:56.030 --> 01:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
trying to do things like promote the
 
01:16:58.430 --> 01:16:58.440 align:start position:0%
child care scholarship making changes
 
01:17:01.709 --> 01:17:01.719 align:start position:0%
through of um the eligibility for child
 
01:17:04.830 --> 01:17:04.840 align:start position:0%
care uh but really combining it all
 
01:17:06.709 --> 01:17:06.719 align:start position:0%
needs to to we all need to work
 
01:17:09.430 --> 01:17:09.440 align:start position:0%
collaboratively in trying to address the
 
01:17:12.310 --> 01:17:12.320 align:start position:0%
programs there is no single solution to
 
01:17:13.910 --> 01:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
to all of it or we likely would have
 
01:17:16.709 --> 01:17:16.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:21.990 --> 01:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:26.189 --> 01:17:26.199 align:start position:0%
you that's a question um when we talk
 
01:17:29.350 --> 01:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
about the job training and we all know
 
01:17:31.229 --> 01:17:31.239 align:start position:0%
the workforce challenges we have in the
 
01:17:35.149 --> 01:17:35.159 align:start position:0%
state can you give me an example of um
 
01:17:36.830 --> 01:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
how the program could work with that is
 
01:17:40.030 --> 01:17:40.040 align:start position:0%
it more like a could it be a a grant or
 
01:17:41.709 --> 01:17:41.719 align:start position:0%
a scholarship grant for someone to
 
01:17:43.629 --> 01:17:43.639 align:start position:0%
attend a certificate program at a
 
01:17:45.310 --> 01:17:45.320 align:start position:0%
community college or something like that
 
01:17:47.910 --> 01:17:47.920 align:start position:0%
can you just give us some examples sure
 
01:17:51.110 --> 01:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
so we have a degree of uh funds within
 
01:17:55.830 --> 01:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
the budget to uh use for some expenses
 
01:17:59.110 --> 01:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
uh that people may incur as a result of
 
01:18:02.350 --> 01:18:02.360 align:start position:0%
searching for or obtaining work it could
 
01:18:05.870 --> 01:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
be costs for mileage to do job searching
 
01:18:08.229 --> 01:18:08.239 align:start position:0%
it could be costs for like a uniform in
 
01:18:09.950 --> 01:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
a particular
 
01:18:13.189 --> 01:18:13.199 align:start position:0%
employer uh that the individual wouldn't
 
01:18:15.510 --> 01:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
have the funding for otherwise to be
 
01:18:19.110 --> 01:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
able to go uh do that job we also cover
 
01:18:22.470 --> 01:18:22.480 align:start position:0%
things like automobile uh repairs like
 
01:18:25.629 --> 01:18:25.639 align:start position:0%
one time repair for uh you know to fix
 
01:18:28.629 --> 01:18:28.639 align:start position:0%
an automobile so you can get to work um
 
01:18:32.430 --> 01:18:32.440 align:start position:0%
it can also cover um uh it can cover
 
01:18:34.709 --> 01:18:34.719 align:start position:0%
child care as well so we're talking
 
01:18:38.070 --> 01:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
about real Basics like I got a job and I
 
01:18:39.830 --> 01:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
need to wear black pants and a black
 
01:18:42.430 --> 01:18:42.440 align:start position:0%
shirt every single day yes that's what
 
01:18:43.830 --> 01:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
we're talking about we're not talking
 
01:18:46.350 --> 01:18:46.360 align:start position:0%
about a few thousand dollars to go to
 
01:18:47.790 --> 01:18:47.800 align:start position:0%
Nashville Community College for a
 
01:18:51.270 --> 01:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
certificate program correct okay thank
 
01:18:54.510 --> 01:18:54.520 align:start position:0%
you for nin job
 
01:19:00.430 --> 01:19:00.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:05.149 --> 01:19:05.159 align:start position:0%
job any other questions over there
 
01:19:07.510 --> 01:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
representative for
 
01:19:10.470 --> 01:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
it um just a couple of follow-up
 
01:19:13.870 --> 01:19:13.880 align:start position:0%
questions on um on the 60-month
 
01:19:15.590 --> 01:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
restriction and I think you said
 
01:19:18.470 --> 01:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
eligibility is 60% in the state of New
 
01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire of the federal poverty limit
 
01:19:23.390 --> 01:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
um I want to make sure I understand so's
 
01:19:25.950 --> 01:19:25.960 align:start position:0%
right but those restrictions are things
 
01:19:29.310 --> 01:19:29.320 align:start position:0%
put put on by you know essentially us
 
01:19:31.510 --> 01:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
the state legislature the federal limits
 
01:19:34.990 --> 01:19:35.000 align:start position:0%
could be higher is that true or or am I
 
01:19:36.669 --> 01:19:36.679 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding I thought I heard you
 
01:19:38.709 --> 01:19:38.719 align:start position:0%
say at least in the proposed rule the
 
01:19:41.669 --> 01:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
federal limitation would be 200% of the
 
01:19:44.030 --> 01:19:44.040 align:start position:0%
federal po poverty limit but I also
 
01:19:47.950 --> 01:19:47.960 align:start position:0%
heard 60% regards to the state so the
 
01:19:50.550 --> 01:19:50.560 align:start position:0%
federal government sets the requirement
 
01:19:54.950 --> 01:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
for the time limit 16 months so that is
 
01:19:57.510 --> 01:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
set by by the federal government uh but
 
01:20:01.830 --> 01:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
the payment that we issue there are
 
01:20:04.270 --> 01:20:04.280 align:start position:0%
there is some flexibility that we can
 
01:20:07.030 --> 01:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
determine what that criteria
 
01:20:09.430 --> 01:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
is so right now I can tell you that
 
01:20:11.430 --> 01:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
we're working with the other New England
 
01:20:14.070 --> 01:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
states to really identify and do a bit
 
01:20:16.830 --> 01:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
of a comparison if you will as far as
 
01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
what criteria um or what uh what
 
01:20:24.390 --> 01:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
programs are providing for cash
 
01:20:26.149 --> 01:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
assistance so in New Hampshire it
 
01:20:29.310 --> 01:20:29.320 align:start position:0%
happens to be right now 60% federal
 
01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:30.950 align:start position:0%
happens to be right now 60% federal
poverty

01:20:30.950 --> 01:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
poverty
 
01:20:34.629 --> 01:20:34.639 align:start position:0%
level okay and is that is that something
 
01:20:36.470 --> 01:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
that you look for the legislature for
 
01:20:37.870 --> 01:20:37.880 align:start position:0%
guidance on or is that something that's
 
01:20:40.390 --> 01:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
done by the department that would be set
 
01:20:42.910 --> 01:20:42.920 align:start position:0%
by our own administrative rules okay
 
01:20:46.910 --> 01:20:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:49.790 --> 01:20:49.800 align:start position:0%
Minister you you it sounded like you
 
01:20:53.629 --> 01:20:53.639 align:start position:0%
were saying that Financial expenditures
 
01:20:56.149 --> 01:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
may be set by an administrative rule I
 
01:20:58.390 --> 01:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
don't know if I understood you properly
 
01:21:01.870 --> 01:21:01.880 align:start position:0%
the the level of the payment that is
 
01:21:06.110 --> 01:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
issued to cash re assistance recipients
 
01:21:08.950 --> 01:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
is set by administrative Rule and that
 
01:21:10.910 --> 01:21:10.920 align:start position:0%
must be following a
 
01:21:13.350 --> 01:21:13.360 align:start position:0%
statute uh yes we have the authority for
 
01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:14.110 align:start position:0%
statute uh yes we have the authority for
R

01:21:14.110 --> 01:21:14.120 align:start position:0%
R
 
01:21:16.470 --> 01:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
making just making
 
01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:17.990 align:start position:0%
making just making
sure

01:21:17.990 --> 01:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:21:21.310 --> 01:21:21.320 align:start position:0%
um um two things that could help one is
 
01:21:24.390 --> 01:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
um you know um one is a maybe a pie
 
01:21:26.629 --> 01:21:26.639 align:start position:0%
chart you know showing the tan of funds
 
01:21:29.910 --> 01:21:29.920 align:start position:0%
I think we said 42% of them roughly are
 
01:21:33.470 --> 01:21:33.480 align:start position:0%
are going into the cash portion uh I
 
01:21:34.870 --> 01:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
think some of it is
 
01:21:37.030 --> 01:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
Administration maybe just a pie chart
 
01:21:38.350 --> 01:21:38.360 align:start position:0%
shown where the rest is if there's
 
01:21:40.270 --> 01:21:40.280 align:start position:0%
anything else that comes out and if you
 
01:21:41.590 --> 01:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
could provide a link to the Federal
 
01:21:44.470 --> 01:21:44.480 align:start position:0%
Register notice on the on the tanif rule
 
01:21:47.110 --> 01:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
that you were discussing appreciate it I
 
01:21:51.149 --> 01:21:51.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:53.350 --> 01:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
thanks so
 
01:21:55.229 --> 01:21:55.239 align:start position:0%
I had to harp on this family thing and
 
01:21:58.390 --> 01:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
all that but going back to that and
 
01:21:59.510 --> 01:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
understanding now that it's the child
 
01:22:03.430 --> 01:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
that matters here do you have metrics on
 
01:22:07.390 --> 01:22:07.400 align:start position:0%
how many let's just say children uh are
 
01:22:08.830 --> 01:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
able to get out of this program thanks
 
01:22:10.350 --> 01:22:10.360 align:start position:0%
to the help this program
 
01:22:12.950 --> 01:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
provides obviously I understand it means
 
01:22:14.669 --> 01:22:14.679 align:start position:0%
the family situation has to get out of
 
01:22:19.310 --> 01:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
it um before the fiveyear uh time frame
 
01:22:21.390 --> 01:22:21.400 align:start position:0%
and when you get to the we'd ask about
 
01:22:23.830 --> 01:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
the metrics of how many people time out
 
01:22:26.830 --> 01:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
how many of them after they time out are
 
01:22:28.629 --> 01:22:28.639 align:start position:0%
have gained enough from the program that
 
01:22:30.629 --> 01:22:30.639 align:start position:0%
they would no longer qualify for the
 
01:22:32.510 --> 01:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
program despite the fact that their
 
01:22:34.270 --> 01:22:34.280 align:start position:0%
fiveyear timeout has
 
01:22:36.830 --> 01:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
lapsed so I can certainly provide
 
01:22:39.310 --> 01:22:39.320 align:start position:0%
information about the reasons for
 
01:22:42.070 --> 01:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
closure of the tanif program by any
 
01:22:44.470 --> 01:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
particular family so we do track the
 
01:22:46.830 --> 01:22:46.840 align:start position:0%
reasons why they would no longer be
 
01:22:49.870 --> 01:22:49.880 align:start position:0%
receiving tanif be it they became over
 
01:22:53.950 --> 01:22:53.960 align:start position:0%
income uh aged out MET the time limit
 
01:22:56.229 --> 01:22:56.239 align:start position:0%
there's I'm sure several other reasons
 
01:22:58.350 --> 01:22:58.360 align:start position:0%
so I can certainly provide that for any
 
01:22:59.750 --> 01:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
given period of
 
01:23:03.950 --> 01:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
time we don't track families after their
 
01:23:07.310 --> 01:23:07.320 align:start position:0%
tanif is closed I understand that I just
 
01:23:09.390 --> 01:23:09.400 align:start position:0%
like to know how successful the programs
 
01:23:11.070 --> 01:23:11.080 align:start position:0%
are I mean are you actually are we
 
01:23:13.390 --> 01:23:13.400 align:start position:0%
moving people into a situation or at
 
01:23:16.550 --> 01:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
least at a point in time they appear to
 
01:23:18.350 --> 01:23:18.360 align:start position:0%
right no longer qualify because theyve
 
01:23:19.790 --> 01:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
the program's been successful and moving
 
01:23:22.110 --> 01:23:22.120 align:start position:0%
them into jobs and getting them Health
 
01:23:24.350 --> 01:23:24.360 align:start position:0%
uh childcare and so on one of the things
 
01:23:27.830 --> 01:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
that we are initiating uh in uh a
 
01:23:32.870 --> 01:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
contract is it's a current RFP um that
 
01:23:35.709 --> 01:23:35.719 align:start position:0%
uh we are going through that particular
 
01:23:38.350 --> 01:23:38.360 align:start position:0%
procurement process for includes what's
 
01:23:41.990 --> 01:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
what we're calling a post tanif Support
 
01:23:45.350 --> 01:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
Program um so the intent to that is to
 
01:23:48.350 --> 01:23:48.360 align:start position:0%
really work with families once their tan
 
01:23:51.629 --> 01:23:51.639 align:start position:0%
of closes to make sure that they have
 
01:23:54.030 --> 01:23:54.040 align:start position:0%
the support they need moving forward to
 
01:23:56.750 --> 01:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
continue moving forward and not back on
 
01:23:59.229 --> 01:23:59.239 align:start position:0%
tanif if they would still be
 
01:23:59.239 --> 01:24:04.790 align:start position:0%
tanif if they would still be
eligible

01:24:04.790 --> 01:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:08.310 --> 01:24:08.320 align:start position:0%
great looking on page eight at resource
 
01:24:13.270 --> 01:24:13.280 align:start position:0%
limit ,000 for applicants so if you own
 
01:24:15.430 --> 01:24:15.440 align:start position:0%
a car that works and it can be
 
01:24:17.870 --> 01:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
registered you probably have more than
 
01:24:21.350 --> 01:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
,000 worth of
 
01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:24.030 align:start position:0%
,000 worth of
resources

01:24:24.030 --> 01:24:24.040 align:start position:0%
resources
 
01:24:25.830 --> 01:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
I think what I'll do is get you the
 
01:24:30.350 --> 01:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:34.149 --> 01:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:37.709 --> 01:24:37.719 align:start position:0%
welcome okay um so I don't really have
 
01:24:40.310 --> 01:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
any more questions I I want to make sure
 
01:24:42.390 --> 01:24:42.400 align:start position:0%
that everyone on the committee has had
 
01:24:45.189 --> 01:24:45.199 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to ask anything that they
 
01:24:47.629 --> 01:24:47.639 align:start position:0%
want and this has meant to just be an
 
01:24:51.750 --> 01:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
educational form uh I think uh I learned
 
01:24:54.629 --> 01:24:54.639 align:start position:0%
Maybe 40% of what you were able to
 
01:24:57.310 --> 01:24:57.320 align:start position:0%
present today so that wasn't a very good
 
01:24:59.990 --> 01:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
silk rate but I do appreciate your
 
01:25:05.830 --> 01:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
patience um as as I as I well before I
 
01:25:08.669 --> 01:25:08.679 align:start position:0%
leave it um do you have any comments for
 
01:25:10.990 --> 01:25:11.000 align:start position:0%
this approach I mean we've not I I don't
 
01:25:12.950 --> 01:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
know that division 3 has done this
 
01:25:15.390 --> 01:25:15.400 align:start position:0%
before U just bring you in for an
 
01:25:17.870 --> 01:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
educational session would you recommend
 
01:25:21.270 --> 01:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
this to for other divisions or has this
 
01:25:22.790 --> 01:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
been a
 
01:25:25.629 --> 01:25:25.639 align:start position:0%
kind of a huge consumption of your time
 
01:25:28.510 --> 01:25:28.520 align:start position:0%
without much payoff I would say that
 
01:25:31.270 --> 01:25:31.280 align:start position:0%
it's a well-invested use of time I think
 
01:25:34.430 --> 01:25:34.440 align:start position:0%
anytime we have the opportunity to meet
 
01:25:36.189 --> 01:25:36.199 align:start position:0%
face to face in this manner and provide
 
01:25:38.750 --> 01:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
you with information that helps you in
 
01:25:41.470 --> 01:25:41.480 align:start position:0%
making any particular decisions that is
 
01:25:45.109 --> 01:25:45.119 align:start position:0%
time well worth spent okay how about you
 
01:25:47.270 --> 01:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
Mr White because you you're so busy
 
01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:48.350 align:start position:0%
Mr White because you you're so busy
doing

01:25:48.350 --> 01:25:48.360 align:start position:0%
doing
 
01:25:50.510 --> 01:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
everything no I I I think this is a
 
01:25:53.310 --> 01:25:53.320 align:start position:0%
great use of time I I think um you know
 
01:25:54.709 --> 01:25:54.719 align:start position:0%
when we as as everybody on this
 
01:25:56.149 --> 01:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
committee well knows once we get going
 
01:25:58.830 --> 01:25:58.840 align:start position:0%
in the budget we have 52,000 decisions
 
01:26:00.390 --> 01:26:00.400 align:start position:0%
to make and learning about the
 
01:26:03.510 --> 01:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
intricacies of a new program is is not
 
01:26:06.430 --> 01:26:06.440 align:start position:0%
um sometimes the the highest priority so
 
01:26:08.629 --> 01:26:08.639 align:start position:0%
I think this is certainly helpful so if
 
01:26:10.629 --> 01:26:10.639 align:start position:0%
I come back here in a year and I'm I'm
 
01:26:12.070 --> 01:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
pleading and begging for additional
 
01:26:14.910 --> 01:26:14.920 align:start position:0%
money for the TANF Moe everyone on this
 
01:26:16.510 --> 01:26:16.520 align:start position:0%
committee will know what that represents
 
01:26:18.430 --> 01:26:18.440 align:start position:0%
so I I I think it could certainly be
 
01:26:20.870 --> 01:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
helpful so thank you we appreciate the
 
01:26:23.590 --> 01:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity okay thank you I could I ask
 
01:26:26.990 --> 01:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
one more question go ahead so you seem
 
01:26:27.990 --> 01:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
to have
 
01:26:31.430 --> 01:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
notes beyond the slides that you were
 
01:26:33.790 --> 01:26:33.800 align:start position:0%
speaking from I do is it possible to get
 
01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
those sure be great because there's a
 
01:26:38.790 --> 01:26:38.800 align:start position:0%
lot of things you said that I couldn't
 
01:26:40.669 --> 01:26:40.679 align:start position:0%
record quickly enough that I think would
 
01:26:42.590 --> 01:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
help to fill in for the slides I'd be
 
01:26:44.350 --> 01:26:44.360 align:start position:0%
happy to it was a lot of detail there
 
01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:46.510 align:start position:0%
happy to it was a lot of detail there
thank

01:26:46.510 --> 01:26:46.520 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:26:52.709 --> 01:26:52.719 align:start position:0%
you okay so um the the a piece of this
 
01:26:55.109 --> 01:26:55.119 align:start position:0%
that I know that I don't know enough but
 
01:26:58.430 --> 01:26:58.440 align:start position:0%
from what I know it doesn't sound like
 
01:27:00.990 --> 01:27:01.000 align:start position:0%
the state is doing everything it really
 
01:27:05.270 --> 01:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
ought to be doing leveraging tanif to do
 
01:27:10.470 --> 01:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
back on page two bullets two and four
 
01:27:14.390 --> 01:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
specifically related to um end
 
01:27:15.870 --> 01:27:15.880 align:start position:0%
dependence of needy parents on
 
01:27:19.310 --> 01:27:19.320 align:start position:0%
government benefits by promoting
 
01:27:22.629 --> 01:27:22.639 align:start position:0%
marriage I I I don't I'm back led by
 
01:27:23.990 --> 01:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
that I don't even know what that would
 
01:27:26.990 --> 01:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
look like but uh that would be an
 
01:27:29.990 --> 01:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
interesting U brainstorming session
 
01:27:34.070 --> 01:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
someday may be amongst experts so I I'll
 
01:27:35.470 --> 01:27:35.480 align:start position:0%
just say that that's the work we're
 
01:27:37.270 --> 01:27:37.280 align:start position:0%
currently doing on the whole family
 
01:27:41.030 --> 01:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
approach to jobs initiative working with
 
01:27:44.030 --> 01:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
our six all the six New England states
 
01:27:46.669 --> 01:27:46.679 align:start position:0%
yeah to really look at a comparison but
 
01:27:48.430 --> 01:27:48.440 align:start position:0%
we're also taking that to the next level
 
01:27:50.229 --> 01:27:50.239 align:start position:0%
and looking at what other states Beyond
 
01:27:53.550 --> 01:27:53.560 align:start position:0%
New England are doing in this space uh
 
01:27:55.870 --> 01:27:55.880 align:start position:0%
and to be able to see how successful
 
01:27:57.709 --> 01:27:57.719 align:start position:0%
they were what metrics are they
 
01:28:00.070 --> 01:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
collecting um what were some of the
 
01:28:03.109 --> 01:28:03.119 align:start position:0%
factors influencing those particular
 
01:28:05.550 --> 01:28:05.560 align:start position:0%
initiatives so there's a lot of work
 
01:28:09.669 --> 01:28:09.679 align:start position:0%
that to be done but it takes certainly a
 
01:28:12.750 --> 01:28:12.760 align:start position:0%
thorough process in vetting what it is
 
01:28:15.669 --> 01:28:15.679 align:start position:0%
that those other initiatives may be um
 
01:28:18.109 --> 01:28:18.119 align:start position:0%
and that certainly takes some time and
 
01:28:20.830 --> 01:28:20.840 align:start position:0%
our own resources to be able to do that
 
01:28:23.109 --> 01:28:23.119 align:start position:0%
sure and thanks for tri because I I had
 
01:28:26.390 --> 01:28:26.400 align:start position:0%
another question there for you um but uh
 
01:28:28.590 --> 01:28:28.600 align:start position:0%
since I just mentioned two I'd also
 
01:28:30.830 --> 01:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
mention four you know maintenance of two
 
01:28:34.510 --> 01:28:34.520 align:start position:0%
parent families I I um having seen them
 
01:28:37.229 --> 01:28:37.239 align:start position:0%
up close uh I know it doesn't matter
 
01:28:39.030 --> 01:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
what the genders of the parents are as
 
01:28:41.189 --> 01:28:41.199 align:start position:0%
long as somebody's there to support the
 
01:28:43.270 --> 01:28:43.280 align:start position:0%
child and somebody's there to support
 
01:28:46.470 --> 01:28:46.480 align:start position:0%
the primary parent uh that's a very
 
01:28:50.149 --> 01:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
healthy stable environment and kids
 
01:28:52.629 --> 01:28:52.639 align:start position:0%
thrive in that environment so so
 
01:28:54.709 --> 01:28:54.719 align:start position:0%
whatever we can do I think it really has
 
01:28:57.709 --> 01:28:57.719 align:start position:0%
a force multiplicate
 
01:29:02.430 --> 01:29:02.440 align:start position:0%
multip anyways Force multiplier on the
 
01:29:04.790 --> 01:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
impact of our state Investments if we
 
01:29:08.910 --> 01:29:08.920 align:start position:0%
can encourage more stable families to
 
01:29:11.990 --> 01:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
raise their children the um other
 
01:29:15.709 --> 01:29:15.719 align:start position:0%
question you triggered was um um could
 
01:29:17.790 --> 01:29:17.800 align:start position:0%
you just off the top of your head give
 
01:29:21.510 --> 01:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
us an approximate of how many people um
 
01:29:24.270 --> 01:29:24.280 align:start position:0%
you work for you in your department and
 
01:29:27.350 --> 01:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
how you're doing with um having your
 
01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:29.390 align:start position:0%
how you're doing with um having your
Manpower

01:29:29.390 --> 01:29:29.400 align:start position:0%
Manpower
 
01:29:32.750 --> 01:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
filled sure so for the program that
 
01:29:36.149 --> 01:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
oversees uh tanif eligibility so I have
 
01:29:39.030 --> 01:29:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh five different areas that I overy uh
 
01:29:40.669 --> 01:29:40.679 align:start position:0%
so in this particular one through the
 
01:29:43.550 --> 01:29:43.560 align:start position:0%
Bureau of family assistance there are uh
 
01:29:46.390 --> 01:29:46.400 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head I think it's
 
01:29:51.390 --> 01:29:51.400 align:start position:0%
200 like 70 full-time employees uh we
 
01:29:54.070 --> 01:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
have a current current vacancy rate of
 
01:29:57.149 --> 01:29:57.159 align:start position:0%
uh it's been steady at like
 
01:30:03.830 --> 01:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:06.189 --> 01:30:06.199 align:start position:0%
field oh now at
 
01:30:10.470 --> 01:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
19.8% okay so filled positions total
 
01:30:12.709 --> 01:30:12.719 align:start position:0%
positions is
 
01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
393 so what's what's the major pain
 
01:30:19.149 --> 01:30:19.159 align:start position:0%
point of you being at um only 78% of
 
01:30:19.159 --> 01:30:20.590 align:start position:0%
point of you being at um only 78% of
your

01:30:20.590 --> 01:30:20.600 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:30:23.430 --> 01:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
Staffing I would say uh just the
 
01:30:24.750 --> 01:30:24.760 align:start position:0%
difficulty in recruiting for this
 
01:30:27.070 --> 01:30:27.080 align:start position:0%
position it's a very low paid uh
 
01:30:29.189 --> 01:30:29.199 align:start position:0%
positions for the work that they do
 
01:30:31.430 --> 01:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
having to be experts in over 40
 
01:30:35.030 --> 01:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
different eligibility programs um I
 
01:30:37.030 --> 01:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
think that it's
 
01:30:39.870 --> 01:30:39.880 align:start position:0%
uh difficult to recruit for that
 
01:30:43.229 --> 01:30:43.239 align:start position:0%
particular position we've uh submitted
 
01:30:46.109 --> 01:30:46.119 align:start position:0%
last year a request for reclassification
 
01:30:50.310 --> 01:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
or I'm sorry actually a re um um
 
01:30:53.990 --> 01:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
allocation is that the right word
 
01:30:57.350 --> 01:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
um basically to try to move them into a
 
01:30:59.390 --> 01:30:59.400 align:start position:0%
higher pay band and I'm still waiting
 
01:31:01.270 --> 01:31:01.280 align:start position:0%
for the division of personnel to make a
 
01:31:03.470 --> 01:31:03.480 align:start position:0%
decision on that so I didn't ask the
 
01:31:06.870 --> 01:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
question right by paino I mean what
 
01:31:09.350 --> 01:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
damage is being done to your ability to
 
01:31:13.189 --> 01:31:13.199 align:start position:0%
execute the mission as opposed to you
 
01:31:15.790 --> 01:31:15.800 align:start position:0%
know the the problems you're having with
 
01:31:18.470 --> 01:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
getting the people filled I think that
 
01:31:21.030 --> 01:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
it's taxing on the quality of service
 
01:31:24.189 --> 01:31:24.199 align:start position:0%
that we try to provide I hear frequently
 
01:31:28.189 --> 01:31:28.199 align:start position:0%
about difficulties in reaching uh staff
 
01:31:31.550 --> 01:31:31.560 align:start position:0%
to resolve uh and address issues that
 
01:31:34.070 --> 01:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
are important to clients as well as
 
01:31:36.750 --> 01:31:36.760 align:start position:0%
other stakeholders such as our providers
 
01:31:36.760 --> 01:31:37.629 align:start position:0%
other stakeholders such as our providers
for

01:31:37.629 --> 01:31:37.639 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:31:41.390 --> 01:31:41.400 align:start position:0%
Medicaid um so it's it's definitely
 
01:31:43.629 --> 01:31:43.639 align:start position:0%
something that without the proper level
 
01:31:47.430 --> 01:31:47.440 align:start position:0%
of resources that we find um uh
 
01:31:49.910 --> 01:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
bottlenecks in some of those processes
 
01:31:51.950 --> 01:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
because we just don't have enough people
 
01:31:54.430 --> 01:31:54.440 align:start position:0%
to act on everything as quickly as we'd
 
01:31:54.440 --> 01:31:56.270 align:start position:0%
to act on everything as quickly as we'd
like

01:31:56.270 --> 01:31:56.280 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:31:59.189 --> 01:31:59.199 align:start position:0%
to go ahead representative so does that
 
01:32:01.590 --> 01:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
translate there's families who have come
 
01:32:03.790 --> 01:32:03.800 align:start position:0%
forward looking for assistance and
 
01:32:06.550 --> 01:32:06.560 align:start position:0%
they're just is not the staff to help
 
01:32:09.229 --> 01:32:09.239 align:start position:0%
them and they're it's being they're
 
01:32:12.109 --> 01:32:12.119 align:start position:0%
being delayed in their receiving help
 
01:32:13.790 --> 01:32:13.800 align:start position:0%
right I'd like to say that we help every
 
01:32:16.510 --> 01:32:16.520 align:start position:0%
single one of them I'm sure you do but
 
01:32:19.390 --> 01:32:19.400 align:start position:0%
uh definitely I think we I it's safe to
 
01:32:22.390 --> 01:32:22.400 align:start position:0%
say that we experiened delays in in
 
01:32:24.229 --> 01:32:24.239 align:start position:0%
either returning phone calls or
 
01:32:26.709 --> 01:32:26.719 align:start position:0%
processing documents there are several
 
01:32:29.510 --> 01:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
bottlenecks uh as a result of the lack
 
01:32:32.470 --> 01:32:32.480 align:start position:0%
of appropriate resources so that is you
 
01:32:34.910 --> 01:32:34.920 align:start position:0%
know potentially harmful to
 
01:32:37.229 --> 01:32:37.239 align:start position:0%
people all right
 
01:32:39.990 --> 01:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
um that that's everything I had I I
 
01:32:42.470 --> 01:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
really appreciate your time um and your
 
01:32:45.430 --> 01:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
education so so for the committee if we
 
01:32:46.950 --> 01:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
could just stick around another three
 
01:32:50.189 --> 01:32:50.199 align:start position:0%
minutes um I'd appreciate it thank thank
 
01:32:51.790 --> 01:32:51.800 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much for your
 
01:32:53.669 --> 01:32:53.679 align:start position:0%
interest I have a list of things to
 
01:32:55.629 --> 01:32:55.639 align:start position:0%
follow up on and it may take me a bit of
 
01:32:57.270 --> 01:32:57.280 align:start position:0%
time to do that but I will get that for
 
01:33:01.590 --> 01:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
you out outstanding thanks okay so so
 
01:33:06.310 --> 01:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
this was an experiment um uh I I maybe
 
01:33:08.229 --> 01:33:08.239 align:start position:0%
it's too early for you to have an
 
01:33:10.310 --> 01:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
impression of whether or not this was
 
01:33:14.590 --> 01:33:14.600 align:start position:0%
worth your time we have a few more weeks
 
01:33:17.390 --> 01:33:17.400 align:start position:0%
here where we uh where we are not
 
01:33:20.590 --> 01:33:20.600 align:start position:0%
looking at a bill um divisions one and
 
01:33:24.629 --> 01:33:24.639 align:start position:0%
two are but we or not so we have
 
01:33:28.350 --> 01:33:28.360 align:start position:0%
some you could call it spare time um one
 
01:33:30.229 --> 01:33:30.239 align:start position:0%
of the things that I've been wanting to
 
01:33:33.669 --> 01:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
do for years now but the pandemic got in
 
01:33:36.310 --> 01:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
the way so I I was thinking about going
 
01:33:40.229 --> 01:33:40.239 align:start position:0%
and visiting some of the uh inst
 
01:33:42.709 --> 01:33:42.719 align:start position:0%
institutions that we have that we fund
 
01:33:46.070 --> 01:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
that we've never gotten to uh so that's
 
01:33:49.310 --> 01:33:49.320 align:start position:0%
an idea um also as I was talking to
 
01:33:51.709 --> 01:33:51.719 align:start position:0%
representative walner the other day she
 
01:33:53.990 --> 01:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned that uh she might appreciate
 
01:33:56.189 --> 01:33:56.199 align:start position:0%
something like this in the long-term
 
01:34:01.590 --> 01:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
care area um and so uh I'm open to those
 
01:34:04.470 --> 01:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
kinds of ideas I would just ask you if
 
01:34:07.750 --> 01:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
you have a topic like long-term care
 
01:34:11.750 --> 01:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
that you help me by developing you know
 
01:34:14.950 --> 01:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
a a bullet list of of what the agenda
 
01:34:16.790 --> 01:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
might look like so that they have time
 
01:34:18.830 --> 01:34:18.840 align:start position:0%
to prepare we have time to prepare you
 
01:34:21.669 --> 01:34:21.679 align:start position:0%
know that sort of thing not not required
 
01:34:24.830 --> 01:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
but it would be helpful um so with that
 
01:34:26.870 --> 01:34:26.880 align:start position:0%
I'll just open it up and say what do he
 
01:34:29.870 --> 01:34:29.880 align:start position:0%
what do you respond I mean we have the
 
01:34:32.510 --> 01:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
option of doing nothing and just waiting
 
01:34:35.270 --> 01:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
for second committee or we have the
 
01:34:37.709 --> 01:34:37.719 align:start position:0%
option of doing something and then if
 
01:34:39.350 --> 01:34:39.360 align:start position:0%
we're going to do something we can
 
01:34:41.629 --> 01:34:41.639 align:start position:0%
figure out if we' maybe want to go take
 
01:34:43.990 --> 01:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
one of these uh site visits or if we
 
01:34:46.590 --> 01:34:46.600 align:start position:0%
want to bring in another special topic
 
01:34:50.470 --> 01:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:52.790 align:start position:0%
 
thoughts

01:34:52.790 --> 01:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
thoughts
 
01:34:54.390 --> 01:34:54.400 align:start position:0%
I think the idea of a site visit is
 
01:34:56.950 --> 01:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
going be interesting to know how many of
 
01:35:00.149 --> 01:35:00.159 align:start position:0%
all of all of us that are here have
 
01:35:03.350 --> 01:35:03.360 align:start position:0%
visited New Hampshire hospital for
 
01:35:05.629 --> 01:35:05.639 align:start position:0%
instance I haven't visited any of the
 
01:35:07.870 --> 01:35:07.880 align:start position:0%
facilities I I didn't think you had
 
01:35:10.270 --> 01:35:10.280 align:start position:0%
because I've only visited the
 
01:35:15.790 --> 01:35:15.800 align:start position:0%
veterans uh um Clinic what I've been to
 
01:35:19.350 --> 01:35:19.360 align:start position:0%
veterans home we could do that um it's
 
01:35:21.669 --> 01:35:21.679 align:start position:0%
not as exciting as something I've not
 
01:35:21.679 --> 01:35:23.270 align:start position:0%
not as exciting as something I've not
seen

01:35:23.270 --> 01:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
seen
 
01:35:26.950 --> 01:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
yet I'm kidding of course but I I I I'll
 
01:35:29.350 --> 01:35:29.360 align:start position:0%
tell you what why don't we just um if
 
01:35:32.270 --> 01:35:32.280 align:start position:0%
you want to do a site visit just email
 
01:35:34.470 --> 01:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
me saying hey here's what I here's where
 
01:35:36.590 --> 01:35:36.600 align:start position:0%
I'd like to site visit and then I'll
 
01:35:39.189 --> 01:35:39.199 align:start position:0%
just count them up and figure out if
 
01:35:43.350 --> 01:35:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:50.390 --> 01:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:50.400 --> 01:36:01.350 align:start position:0%
 
committe

01:36:01.350 --> 01:36:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:02.950 --> 01:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
okay if Mary Jane was asking about New
 
01:36:04.229 --> 01:36:04.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital I've not visited
 
01:36:06.510 --> 01:36:06.520 align:start position:0%
there just to answer her question I have
 
01:36:07.950 --> 01:36:07.960 align:start position:0%
not visited New Hampshire hospital which
 
01:36:10.550 --> 01:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
I think was what Mary Jan was asking we
 
01:36:12.550 --> 01:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
we actually tried a couple years ago but
 
01:36:14.870 --> 01:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
the pandemic got in the way so that's
 
01:36:17.070 --> 01:36:17.080 align:start position:0%
that's still on the table it was a good
 
01:36:19.709 --> 01:36:19.719 align:start position:0%
tour and then also given the
 
01:36:21.430 --> 01:36:21.440 align:start position:0%
construction that they're trying to do
 
01:36:23.990 --> 01:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
there it there's even more reason to go
 
01:36:27.550 --> 01:36:27.560 align:start position:0%
there so I I I like that and the ranging
 
01:36:29.950 --> 01:36:29.960 align:start position:0%
Transportation there gets to be pretty
 
01:36:34.910 --> 01:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
convenient so but U just so I'm going to
 
01:36:38.750 --> 01:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
take New Hampshire hospital as a yes and
 
01:36:40.910 --> 01:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
if there's a second one I'll wait for
 
01:36:45.390 --> 01:36:45.400 align:start position:0%
people to suggest it all right and then
 
01:36:47.790 --> 01:36:47.800 align:start position:0%
how how should I go about arranging a a
 
01:36:49.990 --> 01:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
tour there Mr Ripple you go through
 
01:36:52.790 --> 01:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
Janet do what um yeah either Janet or I
 
01:36:54.350 --> 01:36:54.360 align:start position:0%
can try to set it up I don't know if
 
01:36:56.070 --> 01:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
there's a day or time that would work
 
01:36:57.629 --> 01:36:57.639 align:start position:0%
best for everybody but I can find out
 
01:36:58.990 --> 01:36:59.000 align:start position:0%
what's available and then let you know
 
01:36:59.000 --> 01:36:59.790 align:start position:0%
what's available and then let you know
the

01:36:59.790 --> 01:36:59.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:37:02.149 --> 01:37:02.159 align:start position:0%
options okay let me let me ask the chair
 
01:37:04.550 --> 01:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
a trivia question
 
01:37:08.430 --> 01:37:08.440 align:start position:0%
um what the what days are the division
 
01:37:11.350 --> 01:37:11.360 align:start position:0%
one and two meeting in
 
01:37:13.830 --> 01:37:13.840 align:start position:0%
general I know you like us to meet on
 
01:37:16.830 --> 01:37:16.840 align:start position:0%
Thursdays don't you well what's
 
01:37:20.910 --> 01:37:20.920 align:start position:0%
happening is that um the health and
 
01:37:23.350 --> 01:37:23.360 align:start position:0%
human service committee wants to use
 
01:37:25.990 --> 01:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
this committee room Wednesdays and
 
01:37:27.910 --> 01:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
Thursdays and they've got a bunch of
 
01:37:29.270 --> 01:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
bills they want to get out of the way
 
01:37:31.270 --> 01:37:31.280 align:start position:0%
and I said yes we'll probably make the
 
01:37:32.990 --> 01:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
room available because we won't have
 
01:37:36.870 --> 01:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
that many meetings so after crossover
 
01:37:38.990 --> 01:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
yeah we'll be loaded so so that actually
 
01:37:40.510 --> 01:37:40.520 align:start position:0%
works out because we're looking for a
 
01:37:42.430 --> 01:37:42.440 align:start position:0%
day to go to the New Hampshire hospital
 
01:37:44.430 --> 01:37:44.440 align:start position:0%
and a and a Wednesday sounds like a good
 
01:37:46.270 --> 01:37:46.280 align:start position:0%
day because there's already competition
 
01:37:49.070 --> 01:37:49.080 align:start position:0%
for this room right so I I'm going to
 
01:37:51.510 --> 01:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
propose that we look for the next next
 
01:37:56.830 --> 01:37:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:01.550 --> 01:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
conflict okay all right well with that
 
01:38:04.790 --> 01:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
Mr Ripple any final words of wisdom nope
 
01:38:07.430 --> 01:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
I have nothing Mr
 
01:38:10.109 --> 01:38:10.119 align:start position:0%
chair next Monday for a full committee
 
01:38:13.070 --> 01:38:13.080 align:start position:0%
meeting at 10 o'clock and uh I think
 
01:38:14.629 --> 01:38:14.639 align:start position:0%
division two is going to have a meeting
 
01:38:17.629 --> 01:38:17.639 align:start position:0%
that afternoon a vision one I believe is
 
01:38:20.510 --> 01:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
already finished with the bills they had
 
01:38:22.830 --> 01:38:22.840 align:start position:0%
but after we have the full committee
 
01:38:25.189 --> 01:38:25.199 align:start position:0%
some of the divisions will be having for
 
01:38:28.430 --> 01:38:28.440 align:start position:0%
the meetings on the bills that we will
 
01:38:31.470 --> 01:38:31.480 align:start position:0%
have have met with for the full
 
01:38:35.629 --> 01:38:35.639 align:start position:0%
committee okay um and I assume you're in
 
01:38:38.390 --> 01:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
