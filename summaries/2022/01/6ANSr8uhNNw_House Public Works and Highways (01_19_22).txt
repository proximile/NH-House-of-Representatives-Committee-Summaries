The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting focused on a range of transportation and infrastructure issues, including funding challenges, tolls, electric vehicles (EVs), and the 2023-2032 10-Year Transportation Plan. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key discussions and decisions:

### **Transportation Funding and Infrastructure Bills**
1. **House Bill 1040**: This bill proposes establishing a commission to study alternative revenue sources for highway and bridge improvements, particularly focusing on electric and hybrid vehicles. With declining revenues from gas taxes due to increased vehicle efficiency and the rise of EVs, the commission would explore equitable ways to ensure all vehicles contribute to road maintenance. The bill received support from environmental groups and the Department of Transportation (DOT).

2. **House Bill 1656**: This bill introduces a road usage registration fee based on vehicle weight and annual miles driven. It faced opposition from groups like the New Hampshire Timberland Owners Association and the Associated General Contractors, who argued the fee structure would unfairly burden trucking companies. The public hearing was recessed and will resume on January 27th.

3. **House Bill 1038**: This bill seeks to name a bridge in Londonderry in honor of Robert J. Prowse, a notable innovator in bridge construction. The committee unanimously voted to pass the bill, recognizing Prowse’s contributions to bridge engineering.

4. **House Bill 1585**: This bill aims to remove ramp tolls at Exit 11 in Hooksett. Representative Tom Walsh introduced the bill, citing concerns about the toll’s impact on local development and traffic flow. The DOT opposed the removal, highlighting potential revenue losses of up to $1.8 million annually and the risk of worsening congestion.

### **10-Year Transportation Plan (2023-2032)**
The 10-Year Transportation Plan prioritizes reducing congestion, enhancing system resiliency, and expanding travel options. Key aspects include:
- **Funding Adjustments**: The plan reflects a $242 million increase in funding, with $225 million allocated to bridge funds and $17.3 million to the EV charging program. Adjustments were made due to cost increases and project delays.
- **EV Infrastructure**: The plan allocates $17 million over five years for EV charging infrastructure, pending federal guidance on implementation.
- **Turnpike Projects**: Lower toll revenues during the COVID-19 pandemic have delayed major turnpike projects, such as the reconstruction of exits in Manchester and the expansion of the Everett Turnpike. The committee hopes for future funding to accelerate these projects.
- **Public Input**: The DOT conducted 22 public hearings and an online survey, with feedback emphasizing the need for improved safety, reduced congestion, and expanded travel options.

### **Toll and EV Discussions**
- **Exit 11 Development and Toll Concerns**: Representatives highlighted the challenges of developing Exit 11 in Hooksett, citing inadequate infrastructure and traffic congestion. The DOT opposed toll removal, stressing the importance of toll revenues for maintaining the turnpike system and funding capital projects.
- **EV Surcharge Proposal**: A bill proposed adding a $0.50 surcharge to tolls for EVs to ensure they contribute to road maintenance costs. The DOT raised concerns about implementation, including identifying EVs and the fairness of charging New Hampshire residents more than out-of-state drivers.

### **Regional Priorities and Next Steps**
- **Regional Priorities**: The Southern New Hampshire Planning Commission supported the 10-Year Plan, emphasizing key regional projects like the completion of Exit 4A and improvements to Route 3 in Bedford.
- **Work Sessions**: The committee planned additional work sessions to review the plan, address amendments, and ensure alignment with state and regional needs, aiming for finalization by mid-February for Senate review.

### **Overall Themes**
The meeting underscored the importance of addressing funding challenges for infrastructure, particularly as vehicle efficiency improves and EVs become more prevalent. Representatives emphasized the need for equitable solutions to ensure all road users contribute to maintenance costs. The discussions also highlighted the balancing act between advancing critical projects, leveraging federal funding opportunities, and addressing public concerns about tolls, congestion, and safety. The 10-Year Transportation Plan aims to create a sustainable and comprehensive framework for addressing these challenges while incorporating public feedback and regional priorities.
