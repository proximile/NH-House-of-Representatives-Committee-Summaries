The New Hampshire House of Representatives recently held a series of meetings to discuss several key bills, with a primary focus on **telecommunications infrastructure**, **public health concerns related to wireless radiation**, **utility regulations**, and **energy facility siting**. Below is a cohesive and comprehensive summary of these discussions:

---

### **House Bill 1644: Telecommunications Antennas and Radiation Exposure Registry**
**Overview**:  
This bill addresses the placement of telecommunications antennas, particularly **5G technology**, and establishes a **radiation exposure registry** to track health impacts from wireless radiation. Key points include:

1. **Health Concerns and 5G**:  
   - The bill mandates a **500-meter (1,640 feet) setback** for antennas from residential areas, parks, schools, and hospitals, citing scientific evidence suggesting reduced health risks at this distance.  
   - Concerns were raised about **radiofrequency (RF) radiation**, especially with 5G’s higher frequencies and power densities. Critics argued that the **FCC’s safety guidelines**, last updated in 1996, are outdated and fail to address long-term exposure or new technologies.  
   - A **court ruling** (Environmental Health Trust v. FCC) found the FCC’s guidelines arbitrary, highlighting a lack of adequate health risk assessment.  

2. **Radiation Exposure Registry**:  
   - The bill proposes a registry maintained by the **Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)**, funded by wireless operators, to allow individuals to self-report health issues and enable independent research.  
   - Estimated costs: **$750,000 upfront** and **$50,000 annually**, with funding through fees embedded in wireless service costs.  

3. **Testimony and Support**:  
   - **Representative Patrick Abrami** and **Senator Denise Ricciardi** emphasized the need for state-level action to protect public health.  
   - Public advocates shared experiences of **electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS)** and urged stricter regulations.  

4. **Opposition and Economic Concerns**:  
   - The wireless industry (CTIA) argued the bill is **unlawful** due to federal preemption under the **Federal Communications Act of 1996**.  
   - Critics warned the bill could **stifle 5G deployment**, hinder rural connectivity, and increase costs for consumers.  

5. **Committee Discussion**:  
   - Questions focused on the **500-meter setback**, **power density regulations**, and the **cumulative effects** of multiple antennas.  
   - The committee committed to further review, with potential amendments to address cost transparency and regulatory clarity.

### **House Bill 1012: Tree Cutting by Utilities**
**Overview**:  
This bill addresses **notice requirements** and **penalties** for utilities cutting trees without proper notification. Key points include:

1. **Constituent Complaint**:  
   - **Paul Wickesser** testified that the **New Hampshire Electric Co-op** cut down 13 ornamental trees on his property without adequate notice, causing $30,000 in damages.  

2. **Bill Provisions**:  
   - The bill requires utilities to provide a **45-day notice by registered mail** (similar to municipalities) and imposes penalties of **two to ten times the damages** for non-compliance.  

3. **Utility Concerns**:  
   - Utilities argued that **registered mail** would be costly and slow down tree-trimming processes, which are essential for preventing power outages.  

4. **Committee Discussion**:  
   - Representatives discussed clarifying the definition of **"licensee"** and ensuring the bill targets specific issues without creating undue burdens.

### **House Bill 1331: Licensing for Power Line Extensions**
**Overview**:  
This bill clarifies that workers installing power line extensions do not need to be licensed. Key points include:

1. **Current Practices**:  
   - Approximately one-third of workers in this field are not licensed, with utilities approving contractors who train and certify their employees.  

2. **Bill Provisions**:  
   - The bill removes the implied licensing requirement, focusing on **utility approval** instead.  

3. **Cost Savings**:  
   - Private contractors often perform line extensions at lower costs than utilities, benefiting consumers.  

4. **Reciprocal Agreements**:  
   - The bill addresses **Canadian workers** assisting during emergencies, who may not hold U.S. licenses.

### **House Bill 1611: Site Evaluation Committee (SEC) Rules**
**Overview**:  
This bill reviews the SEC’s rules to ensure they align with statutory authority under **RSA 162-H**. Key points include:

1. **Concerns Over SEC Rules**:  
   - Critics argued that the SEC implemented rules (e.g., **visual impact assessments**, **emergency response plans**) beyond its statutory authority, particularly for wind energy facilities.  

2. **Opposition**:  
   - Opponents noted that the SEC’s rules were developed in response to legislative intent and public input, emphasizing transparency and public trust.  

3. **Committee Discussion**:  
   - Representatives debated whether the SEC rules should apply universally or be specific to certain energy facilities.

### **House Bill 1116: Transfer of Energy Credits**
**Overview**:  
This bill allows customer generators with multiple utility accounts to transfer surplus energy credits **monthly** rather than annually. Key points include:

1. **Benefits**:  
   - The bill would help businesses and farms with multiple meters manage energy costs more effectively.  

2. **Utility Concerns**:  
   - Utilities raised concerns about the complexity and costs of updating billing systems.  

---

### **Overall Themes**:
- **Public Health vs. Technological Advancement**: The discussions on **HB 1644** highlighted the tension between advancing telecommunications technology (e.g., 5G) and safeguarding public health from wireless radiation.  
- **Utility Regulations**: Bills like **HB 1012** and **HB 1331** focused on balancing utility practices with consumer protections and cost efficiency.  
- **Energy Facility Siting**: **HB 1611** reflected ongoing efforts to ensure the SEC’s rules align with legislative intent and statutory authority.  

These meetings underscored the legislature’s commitment to addressing complex issues at the intersection of **technology**, **public health**, **utility operations**, and **energy policy**, with a focus on transparency, fairness, and practical solutions.
