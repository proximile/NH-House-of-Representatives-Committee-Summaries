The New Hampshire House of Representatives recently held discussions centered on refining gambling regulations, addressing problem gambling, and ensuring proper allocation of funds, with a focus on **Senate Bill 112** and **Senate Bill 19**. The sessions highlighted several key issues and proposals:

### Problem Gambling and Addiction
1. **Problem Gambling Rates**: Representatives expressed concerns about the potential rise in gambling addiction rates near casinos, citing statistics suggesting that addiction rates could reach 8% among daily gamblers living near these establishments. To address this, a dedicated **"problem gaming fund"** was proposed to support prevention, identification, and treatment efforts.
2. **Interconnected Risky Behaviors**: A representative emphasized the interconnectedness of gambling with other risky behaviors, such as substance misuse, smoking, and unprotected sex. They advocated for a broader commission to address these behaviors comprehensively.

### Fund Allocation and Breakage
3. **Breakage Allocation**: There was significant debate over how to allocate **breakage** (unclaimed winnings) from gambling activities. Discussions included proposals to split breakage differently for various activities, such as **paramutual racing**, **simulcasts**, and **historic horse racing (HHR) machines**. The need for a clearer explanation or diagram to help members understand the technical details of breakage, particularly for two-dollar wagers, was highlighted.
4. **Problem Gaming Fund**: **Representative Almy** proposed an amendment to redirect breakage funds to a new **dedicated problem gaming fund** under **RSA 284-22c**. This fund would be non-lapsing and focus on addressing problem gambling. Concerns were raised about the adequacy of current funding and the effectiveness of existing mechanisms, such as the **Lottery Commission** and the **Council for Responsible Gaming**.
5. **Incentives for Operators**: Questions were raised about the impact of redirecting breakage funds on game operators, who currently receive a portion of breakage as an incentive. Representatives debated whether removing this incentive would reduce the availability of games and, consequently, the funds generated for problem gambling.

### Sports Betting and Horse Racing
6. **Sports Betting and Horse Racing**: It was clarified that **horse racing wagers** are not currently regulated under the stateâ€™s sports betting laws. A separate bill, **Advanced Deposit Wagering**, is pending to address this issue.

### Amendments to Senate Bill 19
7. **Lucky Seven and Bingo Games**: Amendments **1475** and **1603** proposed increasing the number of days **Lucky Seven games** can be conducted from 10 to 16 days, aligning it with the proposed increase for bingo games in Senate Bill 19.
8. **Volunteer Reimbursement**: **Amendment 1606**, introduced by **Senator Susie**, sought to increase the amount charities can reimburse volunteers for expenses (e.g., transportation, meals) from $25 to $50, addressing inflation and volunteer recruitment challenges.

### Public Hearing and Next Steps
9. **Public Hearing**: The committee held a public hearing on **Senate Bill 19** with its amendments and planned to reconvene the following week to continue discussions. They also noted the need to address **Senate Bill 120**, an early bill with an approaching deadline.
10. **Executive Session Postponement**: The executive session originally planned for the day was postponed to **May 9th** due to scheduling conflicts and the need for better preparation. Future discussions will focus on refining amendments, ensuring clarity on breakage, and coordinating between existing problem gambling funds.

### Conclusion
The meetings underscored the complexity of gambling regulation and the need for robust funding and oversight to address problem gambling effectively. The discussions will continue on **May 9th**, with a focus on refining amendments, ensuring adequate funding, and addressing the broader impacts of gambling on public health and behavior.
