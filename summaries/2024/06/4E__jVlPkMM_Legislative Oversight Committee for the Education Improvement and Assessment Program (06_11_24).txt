**Comprehensive Summary: NH House of Representatives Meeting on Legislative Oversight Committee for the Education Improvement and Assessment Program (June 11, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on June 11, 2024, for a meeting of the Legislative Oversight Committee for the Education Improvement and Assessment Program. The session focused on proposed changes to the **Ed 306 administrative rules**, which govern public school standards in New Hampshire, and emphasized the committee’s role in reviewing and recommending updates to academic standards. Key discussions and outcomes included:

### **Committee Responsibilities and Scope**  
The committee clarified its primary responsibility for **academic standards**, distinct from operational rules such as minimum standards for public school approval. However, it acknowledged the relevance of **competencies**, **graduation requirements**, and other front-end elements that impact academic standards. The committee’s oversight aligns with state statutes, particularly **RSA 193-E2a**, ensuring that proposed changes adhere to legislative mandates.

### **Proposed Changes to Ed 306 Rules**  
The **Ed 306 rules** were a central focus, divided into two parts:  
1. **Front Half**: Addresses operational aspects, including school facilities, staffing, and graduation requirements.  
2. **Back Half**: Focuses on academic content and subject areas.  

Key proposed changes include:  
- **Class Size Requirements**: The State Board of Education is considering replacing fixed class size mandates with flexible, student-centered ratios. While this aims to provide local districts with greater flexibility, concerns were raised about potential **overcrowding**, particularly in elementary schools.  
- **Graduation Requirements**: Proposed updates include reducing elective credits from six to four and adding new half-credit requirements for **logic and rhetoric**, **civics**, and **statistics/data analysis**. These changes respond to legislative mandates, such as **HB 216**, and aim to modernize the curriculum.  
- **Competency-Based Learning**: The committee discussed transitioning from traditional grade-based learning to **competency-based education**, emphasizing student mastery of skills rather than age-based progression.

### **Public Feedback and Collaboration**  
The committee and State Board of Education have prioritized transparency and public engagement throughout the rulemaking process:  
- An extended **public comment period** from February 15 to April 30 yielded valuable feedback, with written comments and public testimony on draft changes available on the committee’s website.  
- Concerns raised by stakeholders included potential **unintended consequences** of proposed changes, such as overcrowded classrooms and reduced flexibility for struggling districts. Specific subjects like **family and consumer science**, **personal finance literacy**, and **mental health** integration were also highlighted.  
- The committee emphasized the need for clear, consistent language in the rules to align with statutory requirements and avoid duplication or confusion between operational and academic standards.

### **Distinction Between Operational and Academic Rules**  
The committee underscored the importance of distinguishing between **operational rules** (e.g., school facilities, class size) and **academic standards**. Operational rules can proceed through the standard rulemaking process, while changes to academic standards require additional legislative oversight and approval.  

---

### **Future Steps and Timeline**  
The State Board of Education is finalizing draft rules, with plans to present them to the legislative oversight committee by the end of June. The committee anticipates further discussions on areas such as **competencies**, **career technical education**, and their interaction with academic standards. The rulemaking process will follow statutory timelines, with opportunities for public feedback during established hearings.  

---

### **Closing Remarks**  
The chair thanked the public for their input and emphasized the importance of the committee’s work in shaping educational standards that impact current and future students. The committee committed to addressing legislative perspectives and ensuring fidelity to statutory requirements in ongoing efforts.

### **Conclusion**  
The meeting highlighted the ongoing effort to modernize New Hampshire’s educational standards while balancing local flexibility, student needs, and statutory obligations. Through collaboration with stakeholders, public engagement, and careful review of proposed changes, the committee aims to refine the **Ed 306 rules** to better serve students and educators across the state.
