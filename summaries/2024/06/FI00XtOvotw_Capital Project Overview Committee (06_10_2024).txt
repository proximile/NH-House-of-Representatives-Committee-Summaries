The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Capital Project Overview Committee meeting on June 10, 2024, covered several key topics related to capital projects and updates from various departments. Here are the main points:

1. **Meeting Opening**: The Vice Chair called the meeting to order in the absence of the Chair. Minutes from the January 26, 2004, meeting were accepted without discussion.

2. **Old and New Business**: There were no items under old or new business, and no miscellaneous items were discussed.

3. **Informational Items**:
   - **Quarterly Capital Project Report**: The Department of Administrative Services presented the quarterly capital project report for the quarter ending December 31, 2023. No one spoke to the report, but committee members could submit questions for follow-up.
   - **Department of Natural and Cultural Resources Update**: Thea Stewart, Commissioner, provided an update on the Cannon Mountain Tramway project. The project, now in its fourth year, faced budget challenges after bids exceeded the $18 million allocated. The department is considering next steps, including potential additional funding and reevaluating ticket prices. The tram is a significant revenue generator for the state park system, contributing $1.8 million annually.

4. **Questions and Discussion**:
   - **Tramway Costs and Revenue**: Committee members inquired about the cost to ride the tram, the last fare increase, and the potential to adjust prices to cover project costs. The current fare is $28 per person for a round trip.
   - **Project Viability and Funding**: The department is exploring alternatives after receiving only one bid for the tramway project, which was significantly higher than expected. They are considering additional funding requests and potential bonding options.
   - **Operational Concerns**: The tram is nearing the end of its operational life, with some components becoming irreplaceable. A third-party engineering firm assessed the tram and gave it a clean bill of health for the upcoming season, but long-term planning is necessary.

5. **ARPA Funding**: There was a brief discussion about the possibility of using ARPA funds for the project, but it was noted that the project timeline might not align with ARPA requirements.

6. **One-Stop Project Update**: The Department of Environmental Services provided an update on the One-Stop project, which aims to digitize permitting processes and historical records. Significant progress has been made, with Shoreland forms now 100% online and Wetlands forms expected to be fully online by the end of the summer. The digitization of subsurface records is ongoing, with phase one set to be completed by April 2025.

7. **Efficiency Gains**: The digitization efforts have led to efficiency gains for both the public and the department, reducing the need for physical checks and streamlining access to records.

8. **Adjournment**: The meeting concluded with a motion to adjourn, with the next meeting to be called by the Chair when there is subject matter to discuss.

Overall, the meeting focused on updates and challenges related to significant capital projects, particularly the Cannon Mountain Tramway and the One-Stop project, with an emphasis on funding, operational viability, and digital transformation.
