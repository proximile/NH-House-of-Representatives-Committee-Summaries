**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs Committee Meeting (06/25/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs Committee convened on June 25, 2024, to address critical issues related to healthcare oversight, certification programs, and addiction treatment regulation. The meeting was divided into two main segments, focusing on Medicaid provider oversight and the certification of outpatient addiction treatment facilities under **SB 495**. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions and outcomes:

### **Medicaid Provider Oversight and Certification Programs**
1. **Concerns About Oversight**: Committee members raised significant concerns about the lack of oversight for 73 Medicaid providers, emphasizing the need for mechanisms to enforce best practices and ensure high-quality care. Many providers are not Medicaid-certified, leaving them unsupervised and potentially compromising patient safety.

2. **Certification Program Debate**: The committee debated the potential impact of a certification program, particularly whether it might deter new providers from entering the field. Members suggested studying models from other states, such as Maine and Vermont, to understand the effects of certification on service availability.

3. **Focus on Local Solutions**: While considering external models, the committee agreed that New Hampshire should prioritize addressing its unique healthcare challenges rather than adopting approaches that may not align with its needs. They emphasized understanding the local healthcare landscape to develop effective solutions.

4. **Scope of Practice**: Members cautioned against delving into specific clinical practices or theoretical models, advocating instead for a focus on basic best practices, safety, and accountability rather than prescribing treatment methods.

5. **Data Gathering and Collaboration**: The committee planned to gather additional data over the summer, including insights from neighboring states, to inform their decisions. They also emphasized the importance of collaborating with the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and stakeholders to define certification requirements and ensure the program’s success.

6. **Next Steps**: The committee committed to continuing discussions in September, with a focus on refining the proposed certification program, addressing concerns, and ensuring transparency.

### **SB 495: Certification Requirements for Outpatient Addiction Treatment Facilities**
1. **Purpose of SB 495**: The bill aims to regulate outpatient addiction treatment facilities, ensuring they adhere to best practices and provide quality care. It specifically targets outpatient clinical treatment, excluding residential facilities, 12-step programs, and peer support services, which are already regulated or considered non-clinical.

2. **Background**: The bill was prompted by concerns raised in a **New Hampshire Public Radio podcast**, which exposed issues like sexual assault and harassment within a major treatment network. This highlighted the lack of state oversight in outpatient addiction treatment.

3. **Certification and Oversight**: SB 495 proposes creating a certification program under the Bureau of Drug and Alcohol Services. It also includes provisions for a **behavioral health specialist** in the Office of the Ombudsman to handle complaints of misconduct.

4. **Challenges**: The committee discussed the difficulty of regulating outpatient providers, as the state currently lacks a comprehensive list of these facilities. Non-Medicaid providers operate without oversight, leaving patients vulnerable to substandard care.

5. **Amendments and Definitions**: The committee considered amendments to clarify the bill’s scope, including defining **clinical services** and explicitly exempting 12-step programs and peer support services.

6. **Broader Issues**: Some members raised concerns about the broader addiction treatment system, including the lack of clarity on what constitutes effective treatment and the need for a more comprehensive approach. However, the committee agreed to focus on the narrower scope of outpatient treatment for this bill.

7. **Next Steps**: The committee plans to gather more information, including a list of outpatient providers and a matrix of oversight mechanisms, to better understand the landscape and refine the bill’s language.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the committee’s commitment to improving healthcare oversight and ensuring quality care for New Hampshire residents. Key themes included the need for robust certification programs, collaboration with stakeholders, and a focus on local solutions. The committee plans to continue refining both the Medicaid provider certification program and SB 495, with further discussions scheduled for September. By addressing gaps in oversight and emphasizing best practices, the committee aims to enhance the safety and effectiveness of healthcare and addiction treatment services in the state.
