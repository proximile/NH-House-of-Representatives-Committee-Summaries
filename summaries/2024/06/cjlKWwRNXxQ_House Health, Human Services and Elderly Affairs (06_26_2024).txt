**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs Committee Meeting (June 26, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs Committee convened on June 26, 2024, to address critical issues in healthcare, with a particular focus on pain management, opioid use, mental health services, and integrative care. The meeting highlighted the complexities of healthcare legislation, the importance of patient-centered approaches, and the need for collaborative solutions to improve access to effective treatments while balancing cost and administrative considerations.

### **Key Discussions and Themes**

1. **Pain Management and Opioid Use**  
   The committee emphasized the urgent need for alternative pain management strategies to combat opioid dependency. Representatives discussed the importance of offering non-opioid options, such as chiropractic care, acupuncture, massage, and other integrative therapies, for both acute and chronic pain. The challenges of transitioning patients off opioids were acknowledged, with mental health assistance identified as a critical component of this process.

2. **Legislative Challenges and Fiscal Considerations**  
   The debate centered on whether certain healthcare practices should be legislated, with concerns raised about increasing administrative burdens on healthcare providers. Representatives stressed the need for cost-effective, evidence-based solutions that do not overburden the system. Fiscal considerations were a recurring theme, with discussions about the potential financial impact of proposed legislation and the necessity of fiscal notes to assess costs to the state and other entities.

3. **Mental Health Services**  
   The stigma surrounding mental illness and the need for better insurance coverage for mental health services were key topics. Representatives underscored the importance of treating mental illness as a medical condition and improving access to care. The committee recognized the role of mental health support in addressing broader healthcare challenges, including pain management and opioid dependency.

4. **Integrative Pain Care Bill**  
   The committee focused on a bill aimed at providing patients with alternative therapies as a means to reduce reliance on opioids. The bill, which has been in development since 2017, seeks to improve access to integrative pain care services, such as chiropractic care, acupuncture, and massage. However, challenges related to cost, insurance coverage, and evidence-based effectiveness were highlighted. The bill primarily affects the fully insured commercial market (approximately 22% of the insurance market), leaving self-insured plans, Medicaid, and Medicare unaffected. The Massachusetts model, which mandates coverage for certain alternative therapies, was referenced, though its impact on premiums and patient outcomes remains unclear.

5. **Credentialing and Licensing**  
   The difference between credentialing (verifying qualifications) and privileging (authorizing specific procedures) was explained, particularly in the context of insurance companies and healthcare providers. The committee debated the importance of ensuring that treatments are provided by licensed professionals and are supported by scientific evidence.

6. **Stakeholder Involvement and Future Plans**  
   The committee emphasized the need for continued dialogue with multiple stakeholders, including insurers, providers, patient advocacy groups, and professional organizations representing chiropractors, acupuncturists, and other practitioners. Plans were made for a summer study to further explore these issues, with invitations extended to stakeholders for input. The group agreed to meet again in July to continue refining the bill and addressing unresolved concerns.

### **Conclusion**  
The meeting underscored the committeeâ€™s commitment to improving healthcare outcomes through integrative, patient-centered approaches. While the proposed bill represents a significant step toward addressing the opioid epidemic and enhancing pain care, challenges related to cost, insurance coverage, and evidence-based effectiveness remain. The committee aims to strike a balance between patient needs, provider capabilities, and fiscal responsibility, with ongoing collaboration and stakeholder involvement playing a critical role in shaping the final legislation.
