**Summary of the NH House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee Meeting on June 10, 2024**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee convened on June 10, 2024, to address critical issues related to environmental regulation, agricultural policy, and the state’s regulatory processes. The meeting was divided into two segments: a full committee discussion and a subcommittee presentation, both of which emphasized the need for transparency, modernization, and evidence-based decision-making.

### Full Committee Discussion  
1. **Rulemaking and Landfill Issues**:  
   The committee expressed concerns about the rulemaking process, particularly regarding landfill permits. Members criticized the rushed changes to rules, citing a lack of supporting evidence and improper data usage. A specific issue was raised about a company insisting on locating a landfill in a particular tract, which led to hurried rule adjustments. The committee emphasized the importance of a thorough and transparent rulemaking process.

2. **Interim Study Bills**:  
   The committee reviewed three bills referred to interim study:  
   - **HB 1351**: Prohibiting the sale and use of adhesive-based rodent traps due to concerns about cruelty and environmental impact.  
   - **HB 1685**: Redefining Homestead Foods as Artisan Foods and establishing regulations for their production and sale.  
   - **HB 1170**: Requiring public benefit and community impact assessments from the Department of Environmental Services.  
   These bills were assigned to subcommittees for further study: HB 1351 to the Environmental Policy Subcommittee, HB 1685 to the Food Safety Subcommittee, and HB 1170 to the Solid Waste Subcommittee.

3. **Work Timeline**:  
   The committee discussed the timeline for addressing these bills, with some members favoring a September start and others open to beginning work in June if there was sufficient interest.

4. **Public Engagement and Transparency**:  
   The committee stressed the importance of public engagement and transparency in rulemaking, expressing concerns about private meetings and the need for evidence-based decisions.

5. **Closing Remarks**:  
   Members thanked the committee chair for her leadership and nonpartisan approach, particularly her efforts in addressing concerns about leachate treatment and landfill capacity.

### Subcommittee Presentation on Regulatory Processes  
The subcommittee meeting featured a presentation by Adam Finkel, a public health scientist and former federal regulator, who highlighted the shortcomings of New Hampshire’s regulatory framework compared to other states and the federal government. Key points included:  
1. **Outdated Regulatory Processes**: New Hampshire’s administrative procedures have not kept pace with modern standards, such as those established under the federal Administrative Procedure Act of 1946.  
2. **Lack of Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Unlike many other jurisdictions, New Hampshire does not require agencies to conduct cost-benefit analyses, potentially leading to inefficient or ineffective regulations.  
3. **Limited Public Engagement**: Public hearings in New Hampshire are often one-way, with minimal opportunities for dialogue or cross-examination, unlike more interactive processes in other states and at the federal level.  
4. **Arbitrary Decision-Making**: The state’s regulatory system grants significant discretion to agencies, which can result in inconsistent or capricious outcomes.  
5. **Need for Modernization**: Finkel advocated for adopting best practices, including robust public engagement, cost-benefit analysis, and transparent rulemaking.  
6. **Examples of Regulatory Failures**: Finkel cited weak landfill regulations and the lack of guardrails in the state’s regulatory process as examples of systemic issues.  
7. **Proposed Reforms**: Finkel recommended requiring agencies to provide detailed explanations for decisions, respond substantively to public comments, and ensure regulations are both legally sound and wise.  

### Overall Themes and Takeaways  
The meeting underscored the need for New Hampshire to modernize its regulatory framework to ensure effectiveness, transparency, and accountability. Key priorities included improving public engagement, requiring evidence-based and cost-benefit analyses, and addressing specific environmental and agricultural issues such as landfill management and food safety. The committee expressed a strong commitment to fostering a regulatory process that balances public health, environmental protection, and economic considerations while maintaining transparency and public trust.
