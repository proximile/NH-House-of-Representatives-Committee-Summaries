**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Health and Human Services Oversight Committee Meeting (June 28, 2024)**

The NH House of Representatives Health and Human Services Oversight Committee convened on June 28, 2024, to address critical issues impacting health and human services in New Hampshire. The meeting focused on three primary areas: **nursing workforce shortages**, **children’s behavioral health and childcare**, and **innovative solutions in education and workforce development**. Here’s a cohesive summary of the discussions:

---

### **1. Nursing Workforce Shortages**
The committee highlighted the pressing nursing shortage in New Hampshire, particularly in county nursing homes, where a unit had to be shut down due to staffing challenges. Key discussions and proposed solutions included:
- **Educational Initiatives**: Ideas such as "nurse camps" for high school students, partnerships with schools, and cooperative programs where students shadow healthcare professionals were proposed to introduce young people to nursing careers.
- **Legislative Support**: The need for funding, loan repayment programs, and statutory changes to support nursing education and recruitment was emphasized.
- **Marketing and Outreach**: The lack of marketing campaigns to promote nursing careers in New Hampshire was noted, with proposals to create pathways and materials to guide students into the profession.
- **Collaboration with Institutions**: Partnerships with community colleges, hospitals, and organizations like Conquered Hospital were discussed to create opportunities for students to gain experience and transition into nursing roles.

### **2. Children’s Behavioral Health and Childcare**
The committee addressed two major areas affecting children and families: the **Youth Development Center (YDC) rebuild** and the **Children’s Behavioral Health System of Care**, as well as challenges in the childcare sector.

#### **Youth Development Center (YDC) Rebuild**
- The YDC rebuild is progressing, with a focus on creating a state-of-the-art, therapeutically oriented facility rather than a correctional one.
- Located on the same campus as Hampstead Hospital, construction documents will be finalized in early August, with bids expected in September/October. Construction is set to begin immediately, targeting completion by summer 2026.
- Collaboration with stakeholders, including the Community Impact Commission, is underway to address land use, safety, staffing, and training.

#### **Children’s Behavioral Health System of Care**
- The system is being refined to reduce reliance on residential treatment and increase community-based alternatives.
- Organized into five tiers, from basic screening and outpatient care (Tier 1) to acute psychiatric hospitalization (Tier 5), efforts are focused on strengthening early intervention (Tiers 1-3) to prevent escalation to higher levels of care.
- The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is partnering with the University of Connecticut for a comprehensive assessment, with findings expected by 2025 to inform future policy and budget decisions.

#### **Childcare Challenges**
- **Balancing Safety and Affordability**: The committee discussed the need to balance child safety with affordability, noting that complex and lengthy childcare regulations deter providers. The Childcare Advisory Council is working to streamline regulations, particularly for family childcare providers.
- **Workforce Shortages**: The childcare workforce is struggling with shortages, partly due to low wages and the cost-effectiveness of parents staying home. Solutions include increasing the number of providers and exploring grassroots options like in-home childcare.
- **Public-Private Partnerships**: Efforts are underway to address workforce challenges, including potential legislation to create a fund supporting wages and benefits for childcare workers.

### **3. Innovative Solutions in Education and Workforce Development**
The committee explored innovative approaches to address workforce challenges in nursing and childcare.

#### **Innovative Nursing Education Programs**
- **New England College (NEC) Nursing Program**: NEC has developed a Cooperative Education Model in partnership with hospitals like Concord Hospital. This program integrates academic learning with hands-on clinical experience, allowing students to work as Licensed Nursing Assistants (LNAs) while earning academic credit.
- **Preceptor Model**: Students work one-on-one with hospital-based registered nurses (preceptors) who are trained to mentor them, providing a more immersive and authentic nursing experience.
- **Retention and Workforce Development**: The program aims to reduce turnover among new nurses by giving students a realistic understanding of the profession early on and supporting preceptors in their roles.
- **Expansion and Collaboration**: The program’s success, including reduced LNA vacancy rates and high student retention, has sparked interest in expanding this model to other nursing schools and healthcare settings.

### **Key Themes and Next Steps**
- **Collaboration**: Emphasis on stakeholder engagement, including legislators, community partners, and families, to address workforce and systemic challenges.
- **Prevention and Early Intervention**: Focus on preventing escalation to higher levels of care through early screening, community-based supports, and innovative educational programs.
- **Workforce Challenges**: Addressing shortages and low wages in critical sectors like nursing and childcare through legislative support, regulatory streamlining, and innovative workforce development models.
- **Legislative and Funding Support**: The need for funding, loan repayment programs, and statutory changes to support education, workforce retention, and infrastructure projects like the YDC rebuild.

The committee plans to reconvene in September, with ongoing legal discussions throughout the summer. The discussions underscored the importance of collaboration, innovation, and legislative action to address New Hampshire’s health and human services challenges.
