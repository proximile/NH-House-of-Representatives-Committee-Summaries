**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Administrative Rules Meeting (06/21/24)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on June 21, 2024, to address a variety of administrative rules and related matters. The meeting was chaired in the absence of Representative Maguire and focused on conditional approvals, postponed rules, and discussions on legislative and procedural issues. Below are the key highlights:

### **Conditional Approvals and Rule Postponements**
1. **Conditional Approvals**: The committee conditionally approved several rules, stipulating they would not take effect until after July 1, 2024, to align with recent legislative changes. These approvals passed without opposition.
2. **Postponed Rules**:
   - **Rule 2466**: Postponed to allow the agency to address unresolved issues, including unclear language and potential fiscal impacts.
   - **Housing Champion Program (Rule 2467)**: Postponed due to unclear comments and language issues. The committee recommended the agency work with staff to clarify these points.

### **Specific Rule Discussions and Approvals**
3. **Board of Registration of Funeral Directors (Rule 24-4)**: Conditionally approved with minor editorial changes. The rule had expired on May 1, but no enforcement actions or fees were processed during the interim period.
4. **Board of Natural Scientists (Soil 300 Rules)**: Approved the objection response to the Soil 300 rules, which had been conditionally approved at a previous meeting. The committee could only address the initial response due to procedural rules.
5. **Board of Nursing Emergency Rules**: Discussed issues with emergency rules based on outdated versions. The committee decided not to issue a receipt or document number and suggested the agency repeal and refile the rule correctly.
6. **Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) – Immunization Registry (FP 23-1994)**: Conditionally approved with edits, including removing the word "immunization" from the rule text. Concerns about data sharing and privacy protections were addressed, with the department clarifying that no data is currently shared with other states and legislative changes would be needed for such processes.
7. **Boxing and Wrestling Commission**: Approved two rules (23280 and 23282) related to permits, licenses, and ethical standards. The committee noted the need for future legislation to clarify fee authority and ethics rule-making authority.
8. **Department of Safety – Northern Border Alliance Program (2447)**: Approved new rules after interim rules expired on May 29, 2024. The program’s grant funding is non-competitive and first-come, first-served.
9. **Carnival and Amusement Rules (246)**: Conditionally approved interim rules to address comments. Emergency rules were also discussed to ensure safety during the summer fair season.
10. **Department of Resources and Economic Development (2450)**: A revised conditional approval addressed staff comments, but the rule remained on the regular agenda due to an informational note about changes in statute (SB 514) taking effect on July 1, 2024.

### **Meeting Logistics and Future Plans**
11. **Meeting Schedule and Location Changes**: Future meetings will be held on the third Thursday of each month in Room 220 of the annex instead of Room 219.
12. **Consent Calendar**: No items were removed, and it was approved unanimously.
13. **Conclusion**: The meeting concluded with a unanimous motion to do away with the conditional meeting.

This meeting underscored the committee’s focus on ensuring clarity, alignment with legislative changes, and addressing procedural and fiscal concerns in the rule-making process. Future legislative actions were also highlighted to address gaps in authority and implementation.
