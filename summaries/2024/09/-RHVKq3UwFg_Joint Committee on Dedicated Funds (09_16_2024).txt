**Summary of the NH House of Representatives' Joint Committee on Dedicated Funds Meeting (09/16/2024)**

The Joint Committee on Dedicated Funds convened on September 16, 2024, to review and evaluate the status, effectiveness, and future of various dedicated funds managed by the state of New Hampshire. The meeting focused on identifying inactive or underutilized funds, streamlining administrative processes, and ensuring the efficient use of resources. Discussions spanned multiple state agencies and programs, with key points organized into three main areas:

### 1. **Review of Inactive or Underutilized Funds**
   - **Inactive Funds**: The committee reviewed several funds that have remained inactive or underutilized. These included funds related to vocational rehabilitation (led by Tammy, the new director), marine trade education and offshore wind development, and remote captioning. The committee proposed giving funds a five-year window before considering deletion if no progress is made.
   - **Fundraising Challenges**: Some funds, such as those tied to offshore wind projects or vocational rehabilitation, have failed to generate revenue despite initial intentions. For example, the legislative committee to address offshore wind fees has not yet been formed.

### 2. **Evaluation of Specific Programs and Funds**
   - **Vending Machine Program**: The program, which supports entrepreneurs operating vending machines in state buildings and rest areas, is experiencing declining demand. There is a shift toward diversifying products, and the program operates with minimal administrative costs.
   - **Teacher of the Year Program**: Funded by the Special Teachers Competency Fund, this program has seen significant growth, with over 300 recent applicants. The fund is being expanded to support additional educational activities.
   - **Scholarship Funds**: Funds like the Harriet Huntress and Hadie Livy scholarships (established through wills) and the Orphans of Veterans Fund are underutilized. The committee discussed increasing scholarship amounts or transferring administration to educational institutions to improve accessibility.
   - **Public School Infrastructure Fund**: This fund supports school security and internet connectivity projects but faces a backlog of applications. Additional funding is being requested to continue the program.
   - **Robotics Program**: A popular grant program that funds robotics equipment for schools is fully utilized. The committee debated whether it should remain a dedicated fund.
   - **Career School Licensing**: The state ensures financial protections for students through surety bonds, aiming to minimize government involvement and fees.

### 3. **Agency-Specific Fund Management**
   - **Banking Department**: The department operates on a self-funded model, using fees and fines to refund legislative appropriations. A large fine in 2022 allowed for reduced assessments on regulated entities.
   - **Veterans Home**: The Veterans Home, established in 1890, is funded through VA grants, resident payments, and general funds. It manages three dedicated funds: the Benefit Account (for quality-of-life activities), the Guy Thompson Memorial Trust, and the Member Account (for residents’ personal funds). Recruitment and staffing challenges limit the home’s capacity.
   - **Education Department**: The department manages funds for printing legislative books, renting copiers, and the Interpreter Certification Fund (which could be moved to the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification). The Nasmith Fund supports individuals in need, while the Vending Stands Fund aids blind individuals operating vending machines in state rest areas.

### Key Themes and Action Items
   - **Administrative Efficiency**: The committee emphasized the importance of using existing accounting mechanisms rather than creating new dedicated funds where possible. Tammy, the new vocational rehabilitation director, expressed flexibility in this approach.
   - **Proposed Deletions and Modifications**: Several funds were flagged for potential deletion or modification, including those related to remote captioning and advanced manufacturing education. The committee also considered increasing fund limits, such as raising the Orphans of Veterans scholarship to $5,000.
   - **Financial Reporting and Oversight**: Accurate financial reporting and ensuring funds are used effectively were recurring themes. The committee also discussed the challenges of managing private trusts and the potential consolidation of similar funds.
   - **Next Steps**: The committee adjourned with plans to meet again on Wednesday at 10 AM to finalize the annotated spreadsheet and continue their review.

### Conclusion
The meeting underscored the committee’s commitment to ensuring that dedicated funds are used effectively and efficiently to support their intended purposes. By identifying inactive or underutilized funds, streamlining administrative processes, and exploring opportunities for consolidation or expansion, the committee aims to optimize the state’s financial resources and better serve New Hampshire residents.
