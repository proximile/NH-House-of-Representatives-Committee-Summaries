### Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Joint Committee on Dedicated Funds Meeting (09/18/2024)

The Joint Committee on Dedicated Funds convened on September 18, 2024, to review and discuss the management, revenue, and expenditures of various state funds across multiple sectors, including energy, forestry, state parks, libraries, mining, and professional licensure. The meeting highlighted the importance of sustainable funding, the impact of external factors, and the need for legislative clarity and policy alignment.

#### **Energy-Related Funds**
The committee examined several energy-related funds, focusing on their financial management and alignment with state policies and market needs:
- **Electric Assistance Program**: Funded by the Systems Benefits Charge (SBC), this program provides bill discounts for low-income households. Enrollment surged due to increased electricity prices, particularly during the Ukraine conflict. The program is self-balancing, with utilities depositing collected funds and withdrawing what is needed to meet benefits.
- **Renewable Energy Fund**: Supported by alternative compliance payments under the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS), this fund has seen increased revenues and commitments. Recent legislative reforms expanded its scope to include municipal and school district projects, supporting competitive grants for renewable energy initiatives.
- **Energy Efficiency Fund**: Part of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), this fund rebates most of its revenue to ratepayers while allocating a portion to energy efficiency programs, including low-income initiatives and municipal projects.
- **Site Evaluation Committee (SEC)**: Now part of the Public Utilities Commission (PUC), the SEC generates revenue through filing fees for new energy facilities and oversees their evaluation and approval.

#### **Forestry and Land Management Funds**
The committee reviewed several funds dedicated to forestry, land management, and wildfire response:
- **Forest Improvement and Management Funds**: These funds support land acquisitions, timber sales, and forestry operations. Revenue fluctuates due to weather conditions and market prices, impacting program sustainability.
- **Wildfire Training Fund**: Supports wildfire suppression training and equipment, with reimbursements from federal programs.
- **Mining Fund**: Accumulates permit fees from mining operations but has been largely inactive. The committee considered legislative action to clarify its use for monitoring and inspecting mining activities.
- **North Region Headquarters and Fox Forest**: Funded by timber taxes and an endowment, respectively, these facilities play critical roles in forestry management, education, and research.

#### **State Parks and Recreational Funds**
The committee discussed funds supporting state parks, historic sites, and recreational activities:
- **Mount Washington Commission and Tiptop House Fund**: These funds manage operations and restoration efforts at Mount Washington and the historic Tiptop House.
- **Snowmobile and OHRV Funds**: Generated from registrations, these funds support trail maintenance and grant programs, with rising costs due to increased usage and storm damage.
- **Hampton Beach Funds**: The Hampton Beach Master Plan Fund and parking meters fund support capital improvements, storm damage repairs, and economic development. The master plan fund is running low, and additional appropriations may be sought.
- **Canon Mountain Ski Area Funds**: Separate from the general state park fund, the ski account supports operations and capital improvements, including a significant tram refurbishment project.

#### **Library and Conservation Funds**
The committee reviewed funds supporting libraries, conservation efforts, and historic preservation:
- **State Library Automated Information System (AIS) and Lost and Damaged Books Fund**: These funds support library services and book replacement, though revenue has declined due to digitization and improved return practices.
- **Conservation License Plates and Historic Barns Fund**: Revenue from license plates supports conservation efforts, while the historic barns fund, though inactive, remains available for future restoration projects.

#### **Art and Firefighting Funds**
The committee debated the allocation and management of funds for art and firefighting equipment:
- **Percent for Art Program**: Allocates 0.5% of construction costs for new state buildings to art, with discussions on the selection process and types of art funded.
- **Firefighting Equipment Fund**: Provides tools and equipment to municipalities, with questions raised about the stateâ€™s role in purchasing equipment for local fire departments.

#### **Professional Licensure and Interagency Funds**
The committee examined funds managed by the Department of Revenue Administration (DRA) and the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC):
- **Municipal Officers and Employees Training Fund**: Supports training materials and refreshments, capped at $5,000 annually.
- **Revenue Information Management System (RIMS) Fund**: Supports debt service for a new IT system, with $4 million transferred annually until $40 million is reached.
- **OPLC Funds**: These include the Non-APS Fund, which collects fees for professional boards, and the Professional Health Program Fund, which supports health professionals with substance abuse or impairment issues. Concerns were raised about fee affordability for lower-paid professionals.

#### **Inactive and Trust Funds**
The committee identified inactive funds, such as a forest management fund created in 2019, and discussed the need for legislative action to repeal or repurpose them. They also reviewed trust funds supporting the Connecticut Lakes area, emphasizing the need to preserve principal balances.

#### **Key Themes and Concerns**
Throughout the meeting, committee members emphasized:
- The importance of sustainable and consistent funding to avoid program instability.
- The impact of external factors like market conditions, weather, and global events on fund revenues and expenditures.
- The need for clear legislative guidance and policy alignment to ensure funds are used effectively and equitably.
- The value of dedicated funds in supporting critical state programs, even if activity is low, to ensure resources are available for future needs.

The committee concluded with plans to reconvene on October 2, 2024, to further discuss pending issues, including the Connecticut Lakes funds and other legislative actions.
