**Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting: Commission to Study the Effect of Recent Changes Made to Charitable Gaming Laws (09/16/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened to discuss the work of the Commission to Study the Effect of Recent Changes Made to Charitable Gaming Laws, with a particular focus on the newly authorized Historical Horse Racing (HHR) machines. The meeting addressed a wide range of issues related to charitable gaming, including licensing, revenue distribution, operational policies, and the impact of HHR on the industry. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and decisions:

### **Key Discussions and Decisions**

#### **1. Vendor Licensing and Regulation**
- **Vendor Licensing**: The commission debated whether gaming vendors should be licensed by the state. While gaming equipment and math models are tested and approved by certified labs (e.g., Gaming Laboratories International, GLI), the commission leaned against requiring vendor licensing, viewing it as unnecessary additional work with no clear added value.
- **Regulation and Fees**: The commission considered increasing the annual license fee for gaming operators, currently set at $750, to better cover regulatory costs. They also discussed imposing fees on vendors and equipment manufacturers, aligning with practices in other states. A recommendation was made for the legislature to explore a variable fee structure based on facility size and complexity.

#### **2. Investigation Fees**
- The commission recommended removing the $5,000 cap on investigation fees for new entrants into the gaming market, allowing fees to reflect the actual cost of investigations.

#### **3. Casino Credit**
- The commission unanimously agreed to prohibit casino credit, aligning with existing policies in other gaming platforms in the state.

#### **4. Operating Hours**
- The commission recommended maintaining current operating hours for charitable gaming establishments, opposing 24-hour operations due to staffing challenges and alignment with charitable gaming principles.

#### **5. Complimentary Alcohol**
- The commission unanimously opposed allowing complimentary alcohol at gaming establishments.

#### **6. Tip Pooling**
- The commission decided against mandating tip pooling, citing New Hampshire's existing tipping laws and the preference for employees to retain their earned tips. While tip pooling is permissible, it requires unanimous agreement among employees.

#### **7. Historical Horse Racing (HHR)**
- **Impact on Revenue**: The commission reviewed the significant increase in charitable gaming revenues attributed to HHR and agreed with the legislature's decision to eliminate rents for charities using HHR.
- **Moratorium on Licenses**: The commission discussed the current moratorium on new HHR licenses and suggested reevaluating it in five years.
- **Growth of Gaming Facilities**: With two large casinos under construction, the commission debated whether to limit the number of gaming locations. They concluded that the moratorium on HHR licenses effectively limits new locations.

#### **8. Charity Selection and Revenue Distribution**
- **Charity Selection Process**: The commission examined how charities are selected for gaming events and whether to increase the maximum number of charities allowed per gaming operator from two to four or five. They recommended that local gaming operators continue to select charities but suggested the Lottery Commission could standardize the application process.
- **Revenue Distribution**: Concerns were raised about the disparity in revenue distribution, particularly for charities in northern New Hampshire, where gaming facilities are concentrated in the southern part of the state. The commission acknowledged the need to address this imbalance but deferred detailed discussion to a future commission.
- **Transparency and Waiting Lists**: The idea of a published waiting list for charities seeking gaming dates was proposed to improve transparency, though concerns were raised about prioritizing need over a first-come, first-served approach.

#### **9. Host Community Revenue Sharing**
- The commission considered whether host communities should share in the proceeds of charitable gaming establishments. They acknowledged the potential for municipalities to incur additional costs but did not make a specific recommendation, suggesting future study.

#### **10. Problem Gaming and Future Considerations**
- The commission recognized the need for further study on several issues, including problem gaming, the revenue split between charities, and the potential impact of large gaming facilities on host communities. They also acknowledged the need for a separate future commission to address broader issues, such as revenue growth, equitable distribution, and the sufficiency of current fee structures.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting concluded with plans to reconvene on September 30th to continue discussions and finalize recommendations for the report. The commission highlighted the complexities of charitable gaming regulation and emphasized the need for ongoing review to ensure fairness, transparency, and adequate funding for regulatory oversight. The evolving landscape of charitable gaming in New Hampshire, particularly with the introduction of HHR, requires careful consideration to balance the interests of charities, operators, host communities, and the state.
