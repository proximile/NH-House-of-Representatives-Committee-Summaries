**Summary of the NH House of Representatives Fiscal Committee Meeting – September 13, 2024**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Fiscal Committee convened on September 13, 2024, to address a wide range of financial and operational matters affecting the state. The meeting highlighted significant progress, challenges, and future plans across various departments and systems. Key discussions and decisions included:

### **State Financial Systems and Treasury Management**
1. **Accounting System Upgrade**: The committee reviewed the state’s ongoing transition to a cloud-based accounting system, which includes a dedicated module for trust accounts. The migration aims to enhance functionality, reduce manual accounting risks, and improve overall efficiency.
   
2. **Debt Management System**: A new debt management system with robust internal controls has been implemented and is actively used for financial statements, projections, and budget preparations. External auditors (KPMG) are set to review the system, though the committee expressed confidence in its effectiveness.

3. **Documentation and Staffing Challenges**: With upcoming retirements in the treasury staff, the committee emphasized the need for improved documentation of key responsibilities. Efforts are underway to review processes and increase reliance on technology to ensure a resilient treasury and reduce dependency on institutional knowledge.

4. **Audit and Transparency**: The Legislative Budget Assistant (LBA) presented the audit report for the State Treasury for fiscal year 2023, identifying three internal control observations, none of which were material weaknesses. Treasurer Monica Mapelli acknowledged the findings and highlighted progress in addressing previous audit observations. The committee passed a motion to release audit reports in PDF format ahead of meetings to enhance transparency and accessibility.

### **Departmental Funding and Operations**
1. **Health and Human Services (DHHS)**: The committee discussed DHHS-related items, focusing on emergency room wait times and Medicaid funding. DHHS Chief Financial Officer Nathan White provided updates on efforts to reduce wait times and shared the status of Medicaid funding and call center operations.

2. **Department of Justice and Safety**: Funding requests for the Department of Justice, Department of Safety, and other state departments were approved, including allocations for emergency relief and recovery efforts.

3. **Canon Mountain Pricing**: The committee debated proposed price increases for Canon Mountain ski tickets, particularly for seniors and military personnel. New manager Jace Worth explained the increases as necessary to address rising operational costs and balance the budget.

### **ARPA Funds and Late Submissions**
Senators raised concerns about the late submission of funding requests, particularly those tied to ARPA (American Rescue Plan Act) funds. They stressed the importance of timely submissions to allow for thorough review and discussion.

### **Recognition and Future Meetings**
The committee commended Treasurer Monica Mapelli and her staff for their effective management of state funds, particularly in balancing the budget through interest income. Sympathies were extended to a colleague who recently passed away. Future meetings were scheduled for October 18th and November 15th, with potential adjustments due to the Thanksgiving holiday.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting concluded with the approval of several funding items and a commitment to address ongoing financial and operational challenges. The committee emphasized the importance of maintaining strong internal controls, improving transparency, and leveraging technology to ensure the state’s financial resilience.

This comprehensive summary reflects the committee’s dedication to addressing critical financial issues, fostering transparency, and ensuring the efficient operation of state systems and departments.
