### Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Health and Human Services Oversight Committee Meeting (09/27/2024)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Health and Human Services Oversight Committee convened on September 27, 2024, to discuss a wide range of topics related to healthcare oversight, legislative updates, and departmental initiatives. The meeting was structured around two main segments, covering key issues such as healthcare metrics, adverse events, workforce challenges, environmental health concerns, and patient safety. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

---

### **Healthcare Metrics and Reporting**
- **Data Collection and Disparities**: Hospitals are currently collecting data on race, ethnicity, and language to identify healthcare disparities. The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) shares these metrics with the committee to track progress toward healthcare objectives. The committee emphasized the importance of expanding data collection to other patient populations.
- **Adverse Events**: The committee reviewed a report on adverse events in hospitals and ambulatory surgical care settings. A notable decrease in adverse events was observed as the use of contract staff declined. Further analysis was requested, including benchmarking against similar states and potential legislative recommendations.
- **Wrong Site Surgery**: A specific concern was raised about wrong site surgeries, particularly in spinal surgeries where incorrect vertebral levels are sometimes targeted. The committee clarified that "site" refers to the location on the body, not vision.
- **Long-Term Care Oversight**: While there is no statutory requirement for reporting adverse events in long-term care facilities, DHHS investigates incidents such as bed falls. The committee expressed interest in enhancing oversight in this area.

### **Community Services and Legislative Updates**
- **Community Services Block Grant (CSBG)**: The committee reviewed the CSBG state plan, which funds services to alleviate poverty. New Hampshire’s five community action programs (CAPs) address regional challenges like substance misuse, housing, and transportation through needs assessments and targeted interventions.
- **Legislative Updates**:
  - **HB 1168**: A study committee is examining the impact of the housing crisis on individuals with disabilities, with an interim report due November 1, 2024.
  - **HB 1573/SB 417**: Quarterly reports on oversight of children in residential placements are required, with the first report due October 1, 2024.
  - **HB 1609**: The Commission on Primary Care Workforce has been extended, with reports due in 2026 and 2029.
  - **SB 355**: Newborn screening for cytomegalovirus (CMV) is being implemented, with a report due March 1, 2025.
  - **SB 455**: Medicaid reimbursement for prosthetics and orthotic devices is under review, with a report due November 1, 2024.
- **Emerging Medical Technologies (HB 323)**: The committee will receive a report on emerging medical technologies in October, with recommendations to continue the committee’s work.

### **DHHS Commissioner’s Update**
- **Roadmap Initiatives**: The DHHS Commissioner outlined the department’s roadmap, focusing on three commitments: investing in people and culture, promoting thriving communities, and improving customer service.
- **Mission Zero**: Progress was reported on Mission Zero, an initiative to eliminate emergency room boarding. Wait times have been reduced by 50% over the past year, though challenges remain in discharging patients due to downstream issues.
- **Workforce Challenges**: DHHS faces significant workforce shortages, with only about 2,700 out of 3,000 authorized positions filled. The Commissioner highlighted the difficulty in retaining staff due to the stressful nature of the work and the need for competitive wages.

### **Environmental Health and School-Based Clinics**
- **Environmental Health Concerns**: A representative raised concerns about a proposed recycling center in Claremont, which could introduce heavy metals and asbestos into the community. The Commissioner noted collaboration with the Department of Environmental Services but acknowledged the need for further discussion with public health officials.
- **School-Based Health Clinics**: Concerns were raised about the scope and parental consent requirements of school-based health clinics. The committee requested a detailed review of the program’s impact on parental rights and financing.

### **Youth Development Center and Patient Safety**
- **Youth Development Center Census Management**: Questions were raised about the census management plan for the new Youth Development Center, particularly how the department plans to manage the number of residents and what measures will be taken if the census exceeds the legal limit.
- **Quality and Patient Safety Commission Report**: The Commission presented its 2024 annual report, highlighting efforts to reduce adverse events such as pressure injuries, patient falls, and wrong-site surgeries. The Commission emphasized the importance of a just culture, workforce safety, and evidence-based practices in improving patient care.
- **Workplace Safety**: Collaboration with the newly formed New Hampshire Healthcare Workplace Safety Commission was discussed, with a focus on addressing workplace safety issues and including patient and family perspectives in event investigations.
