**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House Special Committee on the Family Division of the Circuit Court Meeting (09/17/2024)**

The New Hampshire House Special Committee on the Family Division of the Circuit Court convened on September 17, 2024, to examine the state’s child support enforcement mechanisms and administrative processes under Title IV-D of the Social Security Act. The meeting focused on evaluating the effectiveness of current practices, identifying areas for improvement, and clarifying the roles of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and the courts in administering child support. Key discussions and takeaways included:

### **1. Enforcement Mechanisms and Challenges**  
The committee explored various tools used to enforce child support orders, including wage garnishment, license revocation, and credit bureau liens. Specific topics included:  
- **Driver’s License Revocation and Reinstatement**: The committee debated updating the statute allowing license revocation for non-payment of child support. Concerns were raised about individuals making good faith efforts to comply (e.g., securing a job) but still being denied reinstatement until full compliance. Suggestions were made to return licenses earlier if consistent payments or job offers are demonstrated.  
- **Wage Garnishment**: Challenges were highlighted for individuals in contract or gig economy jobs (e.g., Uber, DoorDash) or small businesses that may not meet garnishment requirements. The committee considered legislative changes to address these gaps.  
- **Professional and Hunting Licenses**: The revocation of professional and hunting/fishing licenses as enforcement tools was discussed, with concerns raised about the impact on individuals relying on hunting for food. Questions were posed about whether this practice is federally mandated or a state decision.  

### **2. Administrative and Judicial Processes**  
The committee clarified the roles of DHHS and the courts in child support enforcement:  
- **DHHS Responsibilities**: DHHS administers most enforcement actions, including wage garnishment, credit bureau liens, and license revocation.  
- **Court Involvement**: The courts handle paternity establishment, support orders, modifications, and show-cause hearings for non-compliance. Criminal non-support cases, though rare, are managed by the Superior Court.  
- **Interstate Cases**: New Hampshire coordinates with other states under the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act to handle cases where one party moves out of state.  

### **3. Funding and Federal Compliance**  
The committee reviewed the funding and federal requirements of the Title IV-D program:  
- **Title IV-D Funding**: The program is 66% federally funded, with $1 million allocated to New Hampshire, constituting less than 1% of the court system’s $130 million budget. An additional $50,000 is received for mediation and arbitration services.  
- **Federal Incentives**: Performance in areas like paternity establishment, support order establishment, and collections determines incentive funds. New Hampshire performs well, with paternity establishment rates between 70-100%.  
- **State Plan**: The state plan, required by federal law, outlines enforcement procedures. Changes, such as updates to child support guidelines, must be approved by the federal government.  

### **4. Voluntary Participation and Communication**  
- **Voluntary Participation**: While Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) recipients are required to participate in the child support program, non-TANF cases can voluntarily opt in. Payers can choose to have payments processed through the state to maintain records, with a $35 annual fee for non-TANF participants.  
- **Communication and Education**: Concerns were raised about individuals being unaware of their options regarding wage assignments. The committee emphasized the need for better communication and education to ensure understanding of the process.  

### **5. Challenges and Next Steps**  
The committee acknowledged challenges within the family court system, particularly due to staffing and resource constraints, but noted that most issues lie with DHHS’s administrative processes rather than the courts themselves. To address these challenges, the committee:  
- Requested additional data on enforcement cases, license revocations, and interstate cases to inform future discussions.  
- Planned to reconvene on October 22, 2024, to finalize recommendations for legislative updates and process improvements.  

### **Conclusion**  
The meeting underscored the importance of balancing enforcement mechanisms with fairness and flexibility, particularly for individuals making good faith efforts to comply with child support orders. The committee aimed to improve the interaction between DHHS and the courts, ensure individuals are fully informed of their rights and options, and address logistical challenges in the enforcement process. By refining these systems, the committee seeks to enhance the effectiveness and equity of child support administration in New Hampshire.
