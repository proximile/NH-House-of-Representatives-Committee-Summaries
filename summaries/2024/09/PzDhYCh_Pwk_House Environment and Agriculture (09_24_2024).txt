The New Hampshire House Environment and Agriculture Committee held a work session on **HB 1351**, a bill proposing to prohibit the sale and use of adhesive-based rodent traps (glue traps). The committee discussed the bill and related issues, including the effectiveness, humaneness, and alternatives to glue traps. Key points from the discussion include:

1. **Interim Study Decision**: The committee previously decided to send the bill to interim study after hearing conflicting testimony. While some testified that glue traps are inhumane and harm non-target wildlife, others argued that banning them outright was not a workable solution.

2. **Labeling Proposal**: One suggestion was to require warning labels on glue traps at the point of sale, indicating their potential to harm unintended wildlife and pets. However, concerns were raised that such labeling could effectively ban the product in New Hampshire, as manufacturers might choose not to sell there due to the state's small market.

3. **Alternative Solutions**: Representative Haskins proposed **rodent contraception** as a more humane and effective alternative to glue traps and rodenticides. This method, already approved and sold in some states, reduces rodent fertility without lethal measures. However, concerns were raised about its long-term impact on the food chain and its effectiveness if not used consistently.

4. **Enforcement and Education**: The committee discussed the challenges of enforcing labeling requirements and educating the public on proper use of glue traps and alternatives. It was noted that many consumers do not read labels, and improper use of glue traps (e.g., outdoors) contributes to unintended wildlife harm.

5. **Recommendation**: The subcommittee voted **not to recommend** the bill for future legislation but suggested that the Department of Agriculture provide educational materials on glue traps, rodent contraception, and the risks of second-generation rodenticides.

6. **Broader Context**: The committee acknowledged the importance of balancing the needs of farmers and food service industries, which rely on glue traps for rodent control, with concerns about wildlife and humane treatment. The EPAâ€™s pending restrictions on second-generation rodenticides were also discussed, as they pose significant risks to wildlife and pets.

In conclusion, the committee opted against banning glue traps but emphasized the need for public education and the exploration of humane alternatives like rodent contraception. The focus will now shift to encouraging the Department of Agriculture to disseminate information on these topics.
