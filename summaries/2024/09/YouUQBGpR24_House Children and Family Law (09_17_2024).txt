The NH House of Representatives subcommittee on Children and Family Law met to discuss **Retained Bill HB 1590**, which focuses on **training regarding abuse and neglect protection** for senior medical providers. The meeting was a **work session**, not a public hearing, and the subcommittee's role was to make an **informal recommendation** to the full committee on whether further legislation is needed. 

Key points discussed:
1. **Purpose of the Meeting**: The subcommittee does not amend or vote on the bill but uses it as a starting point to recommend whether additional legislation is necessary.
2. **Recommendation**: Members generally agreed that further legislation should be considered, but with broader training requirements. Suggestions included expanding the scope to include **first responders, child specialists, gym coaches, and counselors**, as they often interact with children and families in potentially abusive situations.
3. **Concerns Raised**:
   - Some members questioned whether the training should be **mandatory** for medical professionals, as they already have Continuing Education Unit (CEU) requirements.
   - There was debate over whether the legislature should dictate professional training or leave it to **professional associations**.
   - Questions were raised about who would **accredit** the training programs and whether the training would **replace** existing CEUs or be **additional**.
4. **Next Steps**: The subcommittee unanimously recommended moving forward with further legislation, taking into account the feedback and suggestions raised during the discussion. The full committee will meet on **October 22nd, 2024, at 10:30 a.m.** to consider this recommendation.

The discussion highlighted the need for a more **informed and comprehensive approach** to addressing abuse and neglect training, with potential collaboration between the House and Senate on future legislation.
