The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee meeting on September 12, 2024, focused on discussing and organizing subcommittees for specific bills. The chairman emphasized that bills must be "perfect" for recommendation, as the option for "recommended with amendment" was removed. Two key bills were highlighted for subcommittee review:

1. **Senate Bill 353**: Pertains to autism spectrum-related health insurance mandates.
2. **House Bill 1571**: Addresses glucose-related health insurance mandates.

The chairman announced the formation of subcommittees to further study these bills and invited members to participate. Representatives Hunt, Spear, Bullo, and Walsh were assigned to both subcommittees.

Additionally, **House Bill 1621**, which originally aimed to require the state liquor commission to distribute information on alcohol use disorder, was discussed. Although the bill was sent to interim study, the Liquor Commission voluntarily created a video to address alcohol use disorder, which is now playing in state liquor stores. The video, part of the "Strong as Granite" campaign, is non-stigmatizing and action-oriented, encouraging individuals to seek help. Representatives praised this initiative and discussed potential ways to expand its reach, such as including information on receipts or other materials.

Other bills, including those related to alcohol consumption in performance areas and THC labeling, were briefly mentioned, with some already addressed in other legislation. The meeting concluded with the chairman reminding members to monitor the House calendar for updates on the discussed bills and subcommittees.
