**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs Committee Meeting (09/12/2024)**

The September 12, 2024, meeting of the New Hampshire House of Representatives' Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs Committee focused on two key pieces of legislation: **House Bill 554**, addressing pain management and alternative therapies in response to the opioid crisis, and **House Bill SP495**, concerning the certification of Alcohol and Other Drug Use Treatment Facilities. The discussions highlighted the committee's efforts to balance patient-centered care, evidence-based practices, regulatory oversight, and fiscal responsibility.

### **House Bill 554: Pain Management and Alternative Therapies**
The committee extensively debated **House Bill 554**, which aims to expand access to non-opioid therapies for pain management, addressing systemic shortcomings that contributed to the opioid crisis. Key points included:

1. **Purpose and Focus**: The bill emphasizes integrative, patient-centered care and cost-effective solutions for pain management. It seeks to provide alternatives to opioids, such as chiropractic care, acupuncture, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and physical therapy.

2. **Definition of Pain**: The committee debated whether to define chronic pain by a specific time frame (e.g., pain lasting more than three months). Ultimately, they opted for a simplified definition centered on "pain" rather than distinguishing between acute and chronic pain, while maintaining a patient-centered approach.

3. **Insurance Coverage**: A major concern was ensuring insurance coverage for alternative therapies. The committee discussed the financial risks for insurers and the need to balance mandates with patient needs. They debated whether to use "may" or "shall" in the bill's language, ultimately favoring "shall" to ensure enforceability.

4. **Evidence-Based Practices**: The bill requires therapies to be evidence-based, but the committee acknowledged that evidence can vary. They emphasized the importance of patient feedback in treatment decisions and debated setting a "floor" of scientific evidence for coverage.

5. **Licensed Providers**: The bill specifies that therapies must be provided by licensed professionals, excluding unlicensed practices like Tai Chi or yoga unless taught by certified instructors. This exclusion sparked debate, with some members questioning its necessity.

6. **Stakeholder Involvement**: The bill was revised with input from insurers and other stakeholders to ensure broad support. However, insurers remain a key group whose concerns need to be addressed for the bill to succeed.

7. **Early Intervention and Prevention**: The committee highlighted the importance of early intervention and prevention to reduce long-term healthcare costs. They noted that many insurance plans currently do not effectively cover treatments like massage or acupuncture.

8. **Next Steps**: The committee worked to streamline the bill, removing redundant language and addressing potential conflicts. They emphasized the need for clarity and simplicity to avoid past failures, such as SB 440. The bill will likely be reintroduced in the next legislative session, with further refinements based on stakeholder feedback.

### **House Bill SP495: Certification of Alcohol and Other Drug Use Treatment Facilities**
The committee also discussed **House Bill SP495**, which seeks to address abuse and misconduct in outpatient treatment facilities and ensure the effectiveness of treatment. Key points included:

1. **Purpose and Scope**: The bill was inspired by incidents of abuse in unregulated facilities, as highlighted in media reports like the NHPR podcast "13 Steps." It focuses on outpatient facilities, excluding residential programs and recovery housing, which are already regulated.

2. **Oversight and Certification**: The bill aims to establish certification standards for outpatient programs, ensuring they meet best practices and provide effective care. Currently, only facilities receiving Medicaid or Medicare are regulated by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), leaving others without oversight.

3. **Ombudsman Role**: The bill proposes creating an ombudsman to handle complaints and investigate misconduct. However, concerns were raised about the ombudsman’s ability to act effectively without clear certification rules in place.

4. **Innovation vs. Regulation**: The committee debated whether certification might stifle innovation in treatment methods. Advocates argued that evidence-based practices allow for flexibility, while others emphasized the need for oversight to prevent harmful or ineffective practices.

5. **Funding and Implementation**: The bill includes language making implementation subject to funding. DHHS representatives noted that additional staff would be needed to enforce certification standards, raising concerns about budget constraints.

6. **Comparison to Other States**: The committee reviewed how states like California and Florida regulate treatment facilities, considering whether to focus on provider licensing, program oversight, or both.

7. **Next Steps**: The committee considered recommending the bill for further legislation to allow more time for refinement. They discussed the possibility of overhauling the bill to better address gaps in oversight, the ombudsman’s role, and funding challenges.

### **Common Themes and Next Steps**
Both bills reflect the committee’s commitment to improving healthcare outcomes while balancing patient needs, regulatory oversight, and fiscal responsibility. Key themes included:

- **Patient-Centered Care**: Both bills emphasize tailoring treatments to individual patients, acknowledging the subjective nature of pain and the importance of evidence-based practices.
- **Stakeholder Collaboration**: The committee worked closely with insurers, DHHS, and advocacy groups to refine the bills and ensure broad support.
- **Clarity and Simplicity**: The committee emphasized the need for clear, straightforward language to avoid confusion and ensure enforceability.
- **Early Intervention and Prevention**: Both bills highlight the importance of early intervention to reduce long-term healthcare costs and improve outcomes.
- **Funding Challenges**: The committee acknowledged the financial constraints of implementing new regulations and coverage mandates, particularly for insurers and DHHS.

### **Conclusion**
The committee concluded the meeting with plans to refine both bills further, incorporating stakeholder feedback and addressing concerns about clarity, oversight, and funding. **House Bill 554** will focus on expanding access to alternative pain management therapies, while **House Bill SP495** aims to establish certification standards for outpatient treatment facilities. Both bills are expected to be reintroduced in the next legislative session, with continued collaboration among stakeholders to ensure their success. The committee’s structured timeline includes a full committee meeting on October 9, 2024, and a deadline for interim study reports by October 25, 2024.
