The New Hampshire House of Representatives Joint Committee on Tax Expenditure Review met on September 17, 2024, to discuss the **Education Tax Credit Program**, which provides tax credits to businesses and individuals who donate to approved scholarship organizations. The program, capped at $5.1 million in credits annually, allows donors to receive an 85% tax credit against business profits, business enterprise, or interest and dividends taxes. The committee reviewed the program's performance, financial impact, and effectiveness in supporting low- and moderate-income families seeking educational alternatives.

### Key Points Discussed:
1. **Program Overview**:
   - Donations of up to $600,000 per donor are eligible for an 85% tax credit.
   - The program is capped at $5.1 million in credits annually, with a five-year carry-forward provision for certain taxes.
   - In 2023, 118 taxpayers utilized the credit, resulting in $2.256 million in credits issued.

2. **Program Utilization**:
   - Utilization has been consistent, with 110–120 taxpayers using the credit annually.
   - The program has not reached its cap, with annual credits ranging from $1.4 million to $2.2 million in recent years.

3. **Scholarship Impact**:
   - The program primarily supports private school tuition, with scholarships averaging $3,023 per student.
   - Families earning up to 300% of the poverty line are eligible, and 40% of recipients must be from low-income families.
   - In 2023, 600 eligible children were turned away due to insufficient funds.

4. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Students in participating schools perform at or above the 85th percentile academically, comparable to high-performing public schools like those in Bedford.
   - Parental feedback indicates strong satisfaction, with over 1,000 parents reporting measurable academic improvements and the program’s necessity for their children’s education.

5. **Concerns and Questions**:
   - Some committee members raised concerns about the predominance of religious schools in the program and the lack of detailed data on student outcomes.
   - Questions were also raised about the program’s impact on public education funding, particularly in light of ongoing legal challenges to New Hampshire’s public education funding system.

6. **Recommendation**:
   - The committee unanimously agreed that the program is functioning as intended and recommended **no changes** to the current structure.

### Conclusion:
The committee concluded that the Education Tax Credit Program is effective in providing educational opportunities for low- and moderate-income families, with measurable academic benefits and high parental satisfaction. While some members expressed concerns about the program’s focus on religious schools and its broader implications for public education funding, the overall consensus was that the program is fulfilling its intended purpose.
