**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting: Committee to Study the Impact of Pharmacy Benefit Manager Operations (09/12/2024)**  

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on September 12, 2024, to discuss the **Committee to Study the Impact of Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM) Operations** on the cost, administration, and distribution of prescription drugs. The meeting, chaired by Representative Gary Merchant, brought together stakeholders to address widespread concerns about PBM practices and their effects on pharmacies, patients, and the healthcare system. Key themes emerged across three segments of the meeting, highlighting challenges, regulatory gaps, and potential solutions.  

### **Key Issues and Challenges**  

1. **PBM Practices and Transparency**  
   - Independent pharmacists expressed frustration with PBMs, particularly the **lack of transparency** in contracts, **reimbursement rates**, and **Maximum Allowable Cost (MAC) pricing**.  
   - Pharmacists have **no negotiating power** with PBMs, often facing take-it-or-leave-it contracts. Pharmacy Services Administrative Organizations (PSAOs) are used for negotiations, but these efforts are largely ineffective.  
   - **MAC pricing** was a major concern, as it often fails to reflect current drug costs, leading to financial losses for pharmacies. MAC prices are slow to increase but quick to decrease, exacerbating financial strain.  

2. **Patient Access and Pharmacy Closures**  
   - PBM practices contribute to **pharmacy deserts**, limiting patient access to medications and services.  
   - Independent pharmacies are struggling due to **low reimbursement rates** and **high operational costs**, leading to closures, especially in rural areas.  

3. **Reimbursement and Contractual Issues**  
   - PBMs set reimbursement rates for pharmacies, but these rates are often unclear and difficult to negotiate. Pharmacies face challenges understanding and accessing contracts.  
   - PBMs sometimes redirect claims to **discount cards** (e.g., GoodRx) without informing patients or pharmacies, leading to financial losses and confusion.  

4. **Regulatory Oversight and Enforcement**  
   - The **New Hampshire Insurance Department** has limited authority over PBMs, particularly those owned by insurance companies (e.g., CVS/Aetna, Express Scripts/UnitedHealthcare).  
   - While PBMs must be registered and comply with financial solvency and data reporting requirements, much of their operations are governed by contracts with insurers.  
   - There is a lack of clarity on where to file complaints related to PBMs, and questions remain about how PBMs are held accountable for adhering to state laws.  

5. **Patient and Provider Rights**  
   - Concerns were raised about patient access to pharmacies of their choice and whether PBMs enforce "any willing provider" laws, which allow pharmacies to participate in networks if they accept the terms.  
   - Patients and providers need better education about their rights and how to navigate the system, including understanding insurance benefits and filing complaints.  

### **Legislative and Regulatory Recommendations**  

1. **MAC Transparency**  
   - The committee discussed the need for **MAC transparency**, including publishing MAC lists publicly, as some states already do. This would help pharmacies understand and challenge pricing decisions.  

2. **Role of the Insurance Department**  
   - There was a call for the **New Hampshire Insurance Department** to play a more active role as an **arbitrator** in disputes between pharmacies and PBMs. This includes addressing challenges related to MAC pricing and reimbursement rates.  

3. **Strengthening Oversight**  
   - The committee explored ways to strengthen regulatory oversight of PBMs, particularly in vertically integrated models where PBMs, pharmacies, and insurers are owned by the same parent company.  
   - They emphasized the need for greater **transparency** in drug pricing and PBM operations, as well as a centralized portal for price comparison to empower consumers.  

4. **Accountability and Fairness**  
   - The committee identified the need for **accountability** in PBM practices, including prompt payment of claims and adherence to state laws.  
   - They discussed the importance of ensuring fairness for all stakeholders—patients, pharmacies, and insurers—in the prescription drug market.  

### **Next Steps**  
The committee scheduled follow-up meetings for **October 3rd and 17th**, with the goal of drafting recommendations for future legislation by **October 26th**. Future discussions will include bringing in wholesalers and other stakeholders to address challenges in sourcing drugs at PBM-set prices.  

### **Conclusion**  
The meeting highlighted widespread dissatisfaction with PBM practices, emphasizing the need for greater transparency, accountability, and regulatory oversight. The committee aims to protect independent pharmacies, ensure patient access to affordable medications, and create a fairer and more equitable prescription drug market. Through continued study and collaboration, the committee seeks to propose legislative and regulatory solutions that address the complexities of PBM operations and their impact on the healthcare system.
