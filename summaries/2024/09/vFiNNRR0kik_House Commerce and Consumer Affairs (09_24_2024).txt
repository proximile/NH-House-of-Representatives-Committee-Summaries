### Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting: House Commerce and Consumer Affairs (09/24/2024)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on September 24, 2024, convened to address several critical issues under the purview of the House Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee. The discussions spanned topics related to **manufactured housing parks**, **health insurance mandates**, **condominium dispute resolution**, and **tenant protections**, highlighting the need for clearer regulations, stronger consumer protections, and more effective dispute resolution mechanisms.

#### **1. Manufactured Housing Parks: Tenant Protections and Dispute Resolution**
The meeting began with a focus on challenges faced by residents of **investor-owned manufactured housing parks**, including disputes over maintenance responsibilities, rent increases, and the absence of formal leases. Key points included:
- **Dispute Resolution and Board Reinstatement**: Residents advocated for the reinstatement of the **Board of Manufactured Housing**, which was disbanded the previous year. They emphasized the need for a formal dispute resolution process to address issues like unclear maintenance responsibilities (e.g., driveways, trees) and the lack of legal recourse without leases.
- **Moda (Manufactured Homeowners and Tenants Association)**: Moda, a nonprofit organization, was discussed as a potential resource for residents, though it is currently inactive and in the process of rebuilding. Residents stressed the importance of a unified voice to advocate for better living conditions.
- **Rent Increases and Tenant Protections**: Confusion arose over rent increase regulations, with some participants believing increases were capped at $15 per month unless justified. However, without formal leases, tenants have limited protections. The possibility of mandating leases, as done in Connecticut, was suggested as a solution.
- **Resident-Owned Communities (ROCs)**: ROCs were highlighted as a beneficial alternative, as they tend to keep rents low and are managed by residents. However, concerns were raised about the lack of oversight and enforcement mechanisms in both ROCs and investor-owned parks.
- **Abusive Practices**: Residents reported abusive practices by park owners, such as month-to-month rental agreements and dramatic rent increases for new tenants, which devalue homes and hinder sales.

#### **2. Health Insurance Mandates: Diabetes Treatment and Behavioral Therapy**
The committee also debated **health insurance coverage mandates**, focusing on two key areas:
- **Diabetes Treatment**: The discussion centered on **House Bill 1571**, which would mandate insurance coverage for blood sugar monitoring devices, including **continuous glucose monitors (CGMs)**, for diabetics and pre-diabetics. Testimonies highlighted the high cost of CGMs and inconsistent coverage, particularly for **type 2 diabetics not on insulin** and **pre-diabetics**. While the **preventative value** of CGMs was acknowledged, concerns were raised about the financial burden on insurers and small employers.
- **Behavioral Therapy for Down Syndrome**: Rep. Spe raised issues with insurance coverage for behavioral therapy for children with **Down syndrome**, particularly when they are not also diagnosed with autism. The committee discussed potential misdiagnosis or coding errors and encouraged individuals to file complaints if coverage is denied.

#### **3. Condominium Dispute Resolution**
The meeting also addressed **HB 1645**, a bill proposing the establishment of a **condominium dispute resolution board**:
- **Comparison to Manufactured Housing Board**: The proposed board was likened to the **Manufactured Housing Board**, though the head of the **Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC)** suggested a modified version rather than reviving the previous board.
- **Opposition to Combining Boards**: **Dick Sweat**, representing the Vineyards Condominium Association, opposed combining manufactured housing and condominium boards, arguing that condominiums have unique structures and already resolve disputes internally. He criticized the proposed board for its **lack of transparency**, **potential costs**, and **ability to bypass common law and statutory rules of evidence**.
- **Support for the Board**: Some condominium associations supported the idea, citing issues with "bad actors" in their associations. The bill is expected to be revised and reintroduced in the future.

#### **4. Legislative Challenges and Next Steps**
The meeting concluded with a recognition of the **complexity** of the issues discussed and the need for further collaboration to refine proposed legislation. Key concerns included:
- **Broad Language of Bills**: Participants noted the broad language of some proposals and their potential for unintended consequences.
- **Cost Considerations**: Balancing the **health benefits** and **financial implications** of insurance mandates was a recurring theme.
- **Need for Clearer Laws**: The importance of clearer, more accessible laws and enforcement mechanisms was emphasized across all topics.

#### **Overall Outcomes**
- The committee acknowledged the need for **better regulatory frameworks** and **stronger consumer protections**, particularly for residents of manufactured housing parks and condominiums.
- There was agreement on the **preventative value** of expanded health insurance coverage but concerns about the **financial feasibility** of mandates.
- The committee decided to gather more data and real-life examples before making final recommendations on proposed bills, ensuring that legislation addresses specific issues without unintended consequences.

In summary, the meeting underscored the importance of **collaborative efforts** to address the challenges faced by consumers, tenants, and patients in New Hampshire, with a focus on **clarity**, **fairness**, and **effective dispute resolution**.
