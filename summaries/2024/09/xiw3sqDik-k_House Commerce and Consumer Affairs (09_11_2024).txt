**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee Meeting (September 11, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee convened on September 11, 2024, to discuss a range of legislative bills and consumer affairs issues. The meeting was organized around the formation of study subcommittees, debates on the scope of proposed legislation, and discussions on specific bills. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key topics and outcomes:

### **1. Formation of Study Committees**
The committee prioritized the creation of study subcommittees to examine specific legislative bills in detail:
- **HB 1232 (Central Bank Digital Currency) and HB 1674**: Assigned to a subcommittee including Representatives Ammon Spear and Meu.
- **HB 1645 and SB 64**: Assigned to a subcommittee including Representatives Burrows, Melier, Thaxton, and Hunt.
- **HB 64 (Resident-Owned Manufactured Housing)**: Discussed in the context of forming a responsive agency or board to handle disputes, potentially combining it with condominium dispute resolution into a single board.

These subcommittees are expected to meet before the final executive session on October 17, 2024, to present findings and recommendations.

### **2. Manufactured Housing and Condominium Disputes**
The committee focused on addressing issues in manufactured housing parks, including resident-owned and privately owned communities:
- **Scope of Study**: Karen Susi of the New Hampshire Manufactured Housing Park Association emphasized the need to differentiate between resident-owned and privately owned parks, advocating for a comprehensive study of both.
- **Dispute Resolution**: The committee explored the feasibility of creating a board to resolve disputes, with some members suggesting that existing judicial options might suffice.
- **Previous Legislation**: The elimination of the state Manufactured Housing Board due to lack of complaints was referenced, with discussions on whether similar boards should be reintroduced.

### **3. Service Animals and Business Protection (HB 1117)**
The bill aimed to protect businesses from fraudulent service animal claims:
- **Proposal**: Representative Jerry Stringham suggested a hospitality form to address misbranded service animals.
- **Concerns**: Questions were raised about the legality of requiring individuals to disclose disabilities or service animal functions.
- **Advocacy**: The New Hampshire Coalition for the Support of Service Dogs emphasized the need for better education and enforcement of existing laws.

### **4. Home Heating Oil and Propane Contracts (HB 1395)**
The bill addressed customer service issues in the propane industry, particularly tank removal and disputes:
- **Industry Practices**: Representatives from the Propane Gas Association and Energy Marketers Association discussed improvements in handling complaints, especially regarding the problematic company Maragas.

### **5. Animal Testing Alternatives (SB 97)**
The bill proposed alternatives to animal testing for biomedical devices:
- **Support**: The Humane Society advocated for New Hampshire to lead in reducing unnecessary animal testing.
- **Concerns**: Questions were raised about the bill’s applicability given federal regulations and the lack of evidence of widespread animal testing in the state.

### **6. Lithium-Ion Battery Safety (SB 365)**
The bill focused on the safety of lithium-ion batteries in electric bikes and scooters:
- **Safety Concerns**: The State Fire Marshal’s Office highlighted the rise in battery-related fires and advocated for third-party inspections and labeling.
- **Discussion**: Committee members emphasized the need for international standards and addressed risks associated with damaged or unapproved batteries.

### **7. Central Bank Digital Currency (HB 1232)**
The bill aimed to prohibit state or local governments from using a central bank digital currency (CBDC):
- **Debate**: The committee questioned the necessity of the bill given the Federal Reserve’s stance against issuing a retail CBDC.

### **8. Additional Bills**
The committee briefly touched on other bills, including:
- **HB 1507 (Financial Services Innovation "Sandbox Bill")**: Potentially reintroduced or revised in the future.
