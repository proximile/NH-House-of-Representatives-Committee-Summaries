**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Committee Meeting on the Impact of the Housing Crisis on People with Disabilities (10/08/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives committee, chaired by Kathy Stab, convened to study the housing crisis's impact on people with disabilities. The meeting featured presentations from New Hampshire Housing officials and discussions on challenges, solutions, and potential state-level initiatives. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points and discussions from the meeting:

### **Key Challenges and Issues**
1. **Affordable and Accessible Housing Development**:
   - Developing affordable, ADA-compliant housing is costly, with urban infill projects (e.g., in Nashua) facing particularly high expenses.
   - Development costs for a two-bedroom unit range from $350,000 to $370,000, requiring substantial subsidies to keep rents affordable.
   - Parking requirements, especially for people with disabilities, are a significant cost driver. A recent law limits parking to 1.5 spaces per unit to reduce costs and increase density.

2. **Housing Choice Voucher Program**:
   - New Hampshire Housing administers over 4,000 federal Housing Choice Vouchers, with a $50 million budget from HUD. Statewide, there are 11,297 vouchers, 78% of which serve elderly or disabled individuals.
   - The waiting list has nearly 12,000 applicants, with 6,300 being elderly or disabled. Average wait times are 6–8 years, though priority groups (e.g., terminally ill or Medicaid waiver recipients) wait 1–2 years.
   - High rents, low attrition rates, and fixed budgets have created a "shortfall," limiting the ability to serve more households. Only 70% of voucher holders successfully find housing due to barriers like credit issues, criminal records, and accessibility needs.

3. **Project-Based Housing**:
   - Section 811 project-based rental assistance provides 247 units for individuals with severe mental illness, with 50 more recently approved.
   - Project-based vouchers are tied to specific properties, unlike tenant-based vouchers, which are portable.

4. **Statewide Housing Crisis**:
   - New Hampshire faces a severe housing crisis, with high development costs and limited subsidies making it difficult to create affordable housing.
   - The state’s investment in housing is relatively low compared to other states, and additional resources are needed to address the crisis.

### **Solutions and Innovations Discussed**
1. **Universal Design and ADA Compliance**:
   - The committee emphasized the importance of Universal Design and ADA compliance but acknowledged the added costs. They explored whether state programs could incentivize these features.
   - Research was proposed to determine the incremental costs of Universal Design and retrofitting existing housing for accessibility.

2. **Funding and Tax Incentives**:
   - The committee discussed leveraging state programs like RSA 79E, which provides tax incentives for converting underutilized buildings into housing. They considered including Universal Design as a criterion.
   - Funding for housing subsidies is allocated through a competitive process, with scoring based on cost efficiency and adherence to market standards.

3. **Panelized Housing and Innovative Solutions**:
   - Panelized housing (prefabricated units) was proposed as a potential solution for affordable housing, though its cost savings were questioned.
   - The committee explored ways to encourage innovative housing solutions to address the crisis.

4. **State and Federal Collaboration**:
   - The committee discussed whether the state could contribute to voucher funding or incentivize landlords to accept vouchers.
   - HUD’s fair housing regulations limit the ability to create disability-specific housing, but integration of disabled individuals into housing remains a priority.

### **Questions and Concerns**
- Representatives raised questions about the accessibility of housing for people with disabilities, the distribution of vouchers, and the availability of suitable units.
- There was a call for more data on housing needs and the effectiveness of current programs.
- The committee sought solutions to the housing crisis, including potential state-level initiatives and learning from other states’ approaches.

---

### **Next Steps**
- New Hampshire Housing will provide additional data and reports to the committee.
- The committee plans to explore potential legislative and funding solutions to address the housing crisis for people with disabilities.
- Future sessions will focus on researching the incremental costs of Universal Design, engaging with developers and nonprofit organizations, and identifying innovative housing solutions.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the significant challenges faced by individuals with disabilities in accessing affordable and suitable housing. Key issues include high development costs, long waiting lists for vouchers, and limited accessibility features. The committee emphasized the need for increased funding, innovative solutions, and collaboration between state and federal agencies to address the crisis. Future sessions will focus on actionable steps to improve housing opportunities for people with disabilities in New Hampshire.
