**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives' Public Higher Education Study Committee Meeting (10/01/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Public Higher Education Study Committee convened on October 1, 2024, to address critical challenges and strategies in public higher education. The meeting focused on aligning the state’s community college and university systems, improving accessibility, addressing workforce needs, and ensuring affordability for students. Key discussions and initiatives are summarized below:

### **Program Mix, Costs, and Affordability**
- **High-Cost Programs**: The state’s higher education programs are increasingly concentrated in critical fields like nursing and advanced manufacturing, which are expensive to offer. For instance, nursing programs produce over 250 graduates annually but incur a net cost of $3.3 million yearly for the seven colleges involved.
- **Declining Interest in Liberal Arts and Business**: There is a noticeable decline in student interest in more affordable programs like liberal arts and business, which traditionally subsidize costlier programs.
- **Balancing Affordability and Quality**: Increasing tuition risks creating barriers for students, while underinvestment could harm program quality. Early College initiatives aim to make education more accessible.
- **State Funding**: Approximately 60% of revenues come from state appropriations, but this constitutes only about 10% of the total institutional budget, which includes room and board.

### **Transferability, Pathways, and Collaboration**
- **Seamless Pathways**: Significant progress has been made in creating nearly 100 uniform educational pathways from community colleges through universities, simplifying the transfer process.
- **Direct Admission**: Discussions centered on direct admission programs for students meeting certain GPA thresholds, allowing smooth transitions from community colleges to universities.
- **Technology Investments**: Implementing a transfer database and technology to support seamless credit transfers is a priority, with estimated annual costs of $175,000 for the community college system and similar expenses for the university system.
- **Early College and Outreach**: Early College programs have shown success, with 83% of participants pursuing postsecondary education. However, outreach to high school students is limited due to data privacy constraints.

### **Workforce Development and Equity**
- **Untapped Talent**: Declining demographics and an aging workforce necessitate tapping into untapped talent, particularly students from disadvantaged backgrounds.
- **Industry Credentials**: Recognizing industry credentials and prior learning experiences as college-level credits is a focus to support non-traditional students and those with work experience.
- **Internships and Externships**: Expanding internship and externship opportunities is critical for student success and workforce readiness, though coordination and investment are needed.

### **Innovative Programs and Administrative Efficiency**
- **Plymouth State University’s Three-Year Degrees**: Plymouth State University is proposing five three-year bachelor’s degree programs in fields like cybersecurity and criminal justice, pending approval from the New England accrediting body.
- **Shared Administrative Offices**: The university system plans to relocate its administrative offices to the NHTI campus, saving $250,000 annually in rent and fostering collaboration with the community college system.
- **Unified Accreditation**: Efforts are underway to explore a single accreditation model for the state’s seven colleges, aiming for efficiency and a seamless student experience.
- **ERP Implementation**: The university system is transitioning to a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, with HR and finance modules going live in December 2024 and student modules in 2027.

### **Affordability and Financial Sustainability**
- **Tuition Freeze**: Both the university and community college systems have maintained tuition freezes for six years, but financial pressures are mounting due to inflation and increasing student need.
- **Marketing and Outreach**: Better marketing of public higher education opportunities is needed to retain New Hampshire students and attract those who might otherwise leave the state.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting concluded with acknowledgments of the hard work and progress made in public higher education. The committee emphasized the need for continued collaboration, legislative support, and technological investments to address ongoing challenges. Ensuring affordability, improving access, and aligning education with workforce demands remain critical priorities for the state’s higher education systems. The committee adjourned after ensuring all reports were distributed, highlighting the importance of sustained efforts to support student success and institutional sustainability.
