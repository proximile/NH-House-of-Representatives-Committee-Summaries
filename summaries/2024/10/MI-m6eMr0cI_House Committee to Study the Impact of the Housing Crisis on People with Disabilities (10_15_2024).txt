The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened a committee meeting on October 15, 2024, to study the profound impact of the housing crisis on individuals with disabilities. Led by Senator Denise Richardi and attended by Representatives Kathy Stabb, Jessica Lontine, and Josh Ella, the meeting featured testimonies, expert presentations, and discussions highlighting systemic barriers and potential solutions. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points and themes from the meeting:

---

#### **1. Personal Testimonies: Struggles and Challenges**
- **Housing Accessibility and Affordability**: Individuals shared personal struggles, including the inability to afford essential modifications like wheelchair ramps or accessible bathrooms. One tenant advocate highlighted issues such as evictions and difficulties securing accommodations for emotional support animals.
- **Homelessness and Health**: A disabled individual recounted their experience with homelessness, which exacerbated their health condition due to the stress and instability of their living situation.
- **Supportive Housing Needs**: A mother expressed concerns about the future housing options for her daughter with Down Syndrome, emphasizing the need for supportive housing that fosters independence and community integration.

#### **2. Housing Accessibility and Universal Design**
- **Lack of Accessible Options**: Testimonies revealed a severe shortage of housing with necessary accessibility features, such as ramps and accessible bathrooms. The high cost of retrofitting existing homes was identified as a significant barrier.
- **Universal Design**: The concept of Universal Design was proposed as a long-term solution, enabling new housing developments to accommodate people with disabilities and allow them to age in place without costly modifications.

---

#### **3. Housing Discrimination and Fair Housing Laws**
- **Fair Housing Presentation**: Chris Shot, Fair Housing Director of New Hampshire Legal Assistance, highlighted that 77-87% of housing discrimination cases involve individuals with mental or physical disabilities. Common issues include evictions, denied accommodations, and challenges with service animals.
- **Discrimination and Stigma**: Disability-specific housing developments often face stigma and community opposition, further limiting accessible housing options.

---

#### **4. Financial and Regulatory Barriers**
- **High Costs and Limited Funding**: The high cost of housing and repairs disproportionately affects individuals with disabilities, many of whom live on fixed incomes. Limited funding for accessibility modifications exacerbates the problem.
- **Landlord Challenges**: Landlords face financial and regulatory hurdles when providing accommodations, such as installing ramps or sprinkler systems, which discourages them from making properties accessible.

#### **5. Need for Diverse Housing Options**
- **Choice and Independence**: Testimonies emphasized the importance of offering diverse housing options, including both integrated and disability-specific communities. Kim Wolk, a resident of Visions for Creative Housing Solutions, shared her positive experience living in a supportive housing community after struggling with isolation.
- **Transportation and Accessibility**: Limited transportation options and inaccessible housing further isolate individuals with disabilities, making it difficult for them to access employment, healthcare, and community resources.

---

#### **6. Housing Programs and Funding**
- **Lengthy Waiting Lists**: The limited availability of affordable housing and lengthy waiting lists for housing vouchers were identified as critical issues.
- **Streamlining Applications**: Suggestions included streamlining the application process for disability benefits to include automatic enrollment in housing programs, reducing bureaucratic hurdles for those in need.

---

#### **7. Community and Advocacy Efforts**
- **Organizational Support**: Representatives from organizations like Granite State Independent Living discussed their efforts to support individuals with disabilities through home modifications and advocacy for better housing policies.
