**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives' Legislative Oversight Committee for the Education Improvement and Assessment Program Meeting (October 21, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Legislative Oversight Committee for the Education Improvement and Assessment Program convened on October 21, 2024, to discuss revisions to the **Ed 306 rules**, which govern education standards and policies in the state. The meeting focused on ensuring clarity, flexibility, and alignment with educational goals while addressing concerns about resource access, class sizes, curriculum standards, and modern educational practices. Key topics of discussion included:

### **1. Libraries and Media Centers**
- **Concerns**: The removal of references to community resources like town or city libraries in proposed rules sparked debate.
- **Role of Libraries**: The committee emphasized the importance of school libraries in teaching students how to access materials, especially with the rise of online resources.
- **Professional Standards**: Discussions centered on whether school libraries should maintain professional standards, with some members advocating for updated cataloging practices without specifying **American Library Association (ALA)** standards.

### **2. Class Size vs. Student-Teacher Ratios**
- **Shift in Focus**: The committee debated the proposed shift from class size limits to student-teacher ratios.
- **Potential Issues**: Concerns were raised about potential large class sizes if ratios are averaged across multiple classrooms.
- **Flexibility**: The need for flexibility for school principals to manage class sizes, particularly with fluctuating student populations, was discussed.
- **Clarity Sought**: The committee sought clarity on whether the proposed changes would weaken or strengthen class size regulations.

### **3. Academic Standards and Curriculum Frameworks**
- **Relationship**: Questions were raised about the relationship between academic standards and curriculum frameworks.
- **Clarification Needed**: The committee sought clarification on whether curriculum frameworks are built upon academic standards and how they guide classroom instruction and assessment.
- **Historical Context**: The historical context of curriculum frameworks and their alignment with the **2007 HB 927 bill** was discussed.

### **4. Laboratory Class Safety**
- **Exceptions**: The committee agreed that exceptions to laboratory class size limits should require approval from local school boards to ensure safety and supervision.

### **5. Definition of "Educator"**
- **Alignment with Statutory Language**: The committee debated aligning the definition of "educator" with statutory language, referencing **RSA 21-N:8** and **RSA 189:14-a**.
- **Impact on Ratios**: Concerns were raised about how the definition impacts **student-teacher ratios**, particularly whether non-certified staff should be included in these calculations.
- **Recommendation**: The committee agreed to recommend that the definition reflect statutory language to ensure clarity and consistency.

### **6. Instructional Time**
- **Definition Scrutiny**: The definition of "instructional time" was scrutinized, with questions about whether activities like **recess** or **independent study** should be classified as instructional time.
- **Flexibility and Local Control**: The committee discussed the need for **flexibility** in defining instructional time to accommodate diverse educational approaches, emphasizing **local control** over curriculum and scheduling.
- **Recommendation**: A recommendation was made to add language clarifying that instructional time is a function of school schedules, classroom management, and local school board-approved curriculum.

### **7. Extended Learning Opportunities (ELOs)**
- **Definition Review**: The committee reviewed the definition of ELOs and whether it should include specific examples (e.g., internships, community service) as outlined in **RSA 193:1-h**.
- **Retention of Statutory Language**: There was agreement to retain statutory language in the rules to maintain consistency and provide clarity for districts.

### **8. School Facilities**
- **Reference to Ed 320**: The committee discussed whether **Ed 306.07** should reference **Ed 320**, which governs school facility approval and maintenance.
- **Concerns About Simplification**: Concerns were raised about losing specific requirements in the current rule (e.g., specialized spaces for science, arts, and technology) if the rule was simplified.
- **Recommendation**: The committee recommended retaining the current rule with a reference to Ed 320 to ensure comprehensive facility standards.

### **9. Learning and Instructional Resources**
- **Cataloging Standards**: The committee debated the removal of a requirement for instructional materials to be cataloged and classified according to **American Library Association (ALA)** standards.
- **Modern Practices**: Some members expressed concern about losing organizational standards, while others argued that the requirement was outdated given the rise of digital resources.
- **Suggestion**: No final decision was made, but there was a suggestion to update the language to reflect modern cataloging practices without specifying ALA standards.

### **Next Steps**
- **Scheduled Meeting**: The committee decided to schedule another meeting with the Department of Education to seek clarification on unresolved issues, including the rationale for moving from class size to ratios, the role of libraries, and the distinction between academic standards and curriculum frameworks.
- **Tentative Dates**: The meeting was tentatively scheduled for October 28 or 29, 2024, to address these topics before the end of the month.

**Overall**, the meeting highlighted the committee's commitment to ensuring that the Ed 306 rules align with statutory language, provide flexibility for local districts, and address modern educational practices. The discussions underscored the tension between maintaining specific requirements and allowing for local control and innovation, with a focus on enhancing educational outcomes and resource access for students.
