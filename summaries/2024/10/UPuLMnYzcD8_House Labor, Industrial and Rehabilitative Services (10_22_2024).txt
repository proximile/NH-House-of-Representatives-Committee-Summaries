The New Hampshire House of Representatives Labor, Industrial, and Rehabilitative Services Committee held a meeting on October 22, 2024, to address several bills that had been sent to interim study. Hereâ€™s a summary of the key discussions and decisions:

1. **HB 17 - Remote Work Arrangements**:
   - **Motion**: Representative Prout moved not to recommend the bill for future legislation, seconded by Representative Cahill.
   - **Discussion**: Members argued that the bill was unnecessary as there are no prohibitions against employers and employees entering into remote work agreements. They emphasized the flexibility of remote work and the potential complications of mandating written agreements.
   - **Vote**: The committee unanimously voted (15-0) not to recommend the bill.

2. **HB 1023 - Notice of Resources for Veterans with PTSD**:
   - **Motion**: Representative Avalani moved not to recommend the bill, seconded by Representative Drago.
   - **Discussion**: The committee noted that a similar Senate bill (SB 588) had already been passed and signed into law, making this bill redundant. Members acknowledged the importance of supporting veterans but felt no need for additional legislation at this time.
   - **Vote**: The committee voted 13-2 not to recommend the bill.

3. **HB 1226 - Employment Protections for Freelance Employees**:
   - **Motion**: Representative Avalani moved not to recommend the bill, seconded by Representative Prout.
   - **Discussion**: The committee expressed concerns about blurring the distinction between freelancers (independent contractors) and employees. They feared it could recreate issues with employee misclassification. The bill was not supported in its current form, but the sponsor was encouraged to work with the Department of Labor for potential future revisions.
   - **Vote**: The committee unanimously voted (15-0) not to recommend the bill.

4. **HB 1597 - Maximum Weekly Unemployment Benefit**:
   - **Motion**: Representative Avalani moved not to recommend the bill, seconded by Representative Cahill.
   - **Discussion**: The committee agreed that changes to unemployment benefits should be considered as part of a broader overhaul of the unemployment system. They felt it was premature to address part-time unemployment benefits without a comprehensive review of the entire system.
   - **Vote**: The committee unanimously voted (15-0) not to recommend the bill.

### Additional Notes:
- **Announcements**: Representative Seaworth announced that the Workers' Compensation rules are up for renewal, and the Department of Labor will be reviewing and redrafting them.
- **Closing Remarks**: Members thanked each other for their service, particularly Chairman Infantine and acting Chairman Seaworth, and wished everyone luck in the upcoming elections.
- **Adjournment**: The meeting was adjourned after all business was completed.

The meeting was efficient, with all bills being addressed and voted on in a timely manner. The committee emphasized the importance of flexibility, clarity, and comprehensive reviews in their decision-making process.
