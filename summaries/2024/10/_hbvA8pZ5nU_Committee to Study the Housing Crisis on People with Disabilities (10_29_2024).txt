**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Committee to Study the Housing Crisis on People with Disabilities (10/29/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Committee to Study the Housing Crisis on People with Disabilities convened on October 29, 2024, to address the severe housing challenges faced by individuals with disabilities in the state. The meeting highlighted systemic issues, potential solutions, and actionable steps to alleviate the crisis. Key discussions and recommendations included:

### Systemic Challenges and Collaborative Solutions
1. **Housing Accessibility**: The committee noted the severe shortage of accessible housing, with less than 5% of units considered accessible and less than 1% wheelchair accessible. Retrofitting existing buildings and incentivizing Universal Design in new construction were discussed as potential solutions.
2. **Financial and Systemic Barriers**: Lengthy processes for accessing Medicare, financial barriers, and restrictive federal policies like the Fair Claw Amendment were identified as significant obstacles to securing market-rate housing for individuals with disabilities.
3. **Collaborative Approach**: The committee emphasized the need for collaboration among stakeholders, including builders, developers, the Hospital Association, and real estate professionals, to develop comprehensive solutions that avoid conflicting interests.

### Legislative and Programmatic Recommendations
1. **Legislative Changes**: Proposals included revising the definition of "facility" to reduce barriers to housing development, allowing multi-family housing options (e.g., duplexes, triplexes), and increasing the state’s affordable housing fund.
2. **Housing Vouchers and Medicaid Benefits**: The committee addressed the long waiting list for housing choice vouchers and explored the use of Medicaid housing benefits to support affordable housing projects.
3. **3D Printed Housing Pilot Program**: A pilot program for 3D printed housing was proposed as an innovative, cost-effective solution to increase affordable housing options for families with disabilities.
4. **Stable Savings Program**: The state’s stable savings program, which allows individuals with disabilities to save money without losing benefits, was discussed as a tool to help more people pay for housing. The committee explored ways to expand its reach.

### Support and Advocacy
1. **Dedicated State Employee**: The committee suggested appointing a dedicated role within Health and Human Services or the Bureau of Developmental Services (BDS) to assist families in navigating housing development complexities and communicating this role across the community.
2. **Federal Advocacy**: The importance of federal advocacy was highlighted to increase flexibility in housing programs and address barriers such as the Fair Claw Amendment, which restricts new housing projects by local housing authorities.
3. **Support for Families**: The need for additional resources and support for families setting up housing facilities for individuals with disabilities was emphasized.

### Next Steps and Preliminary Report
1. **Preliminary Report**: The committee is required to produce a preliminary report by November 1, 2024. Discussions focused on including recommendations such as legislative changes, incentives for builders, and support programs. The committee also planned to follow up with organizations unable to provide testimony.
2. **Workshops and Working Groups**: The possibility of setting up workshops or working groups was discussed to facilitate more in-depth discussions and develop actionable solutions.
3. **Commission Proposal**: The idea of forming a diverse commission to address the housing crisis was proposed, ensuring all stakeholder perspectives are considered in creating recommendations.

### Conclusion
The meeting underscored the urgency of addressing the housing crisis for people with disabilities in New Hampshire. The committee emphasized a coordinated, inclusive approach that combines legislative action, incentives for builders, federal advocacy, and support for families. By focusing on both immediate and long-term solutions, the committee aims to create actionable recommendations in its preliminary report and lay the groundwork for further progress in the next legislative session.
