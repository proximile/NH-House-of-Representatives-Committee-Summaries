The New Hampshire House Special Committee on the Family Division of the Circuit Court met on October 8, 2024, to discuss Title IV funding and its implications for the Family Court. The committee reviewed a document provided by Representative Smith, which detailed that 66% of funding comes from federal sources, with the remainder from the state budget, primarily administered by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). The Family Court handles four main areas related to Title IV: establishing uniform support orders, establishing paternity, modifying support orders, and show cause hearings. Superior Court handles rare criminal nonsupport cases.

The committee also discussed wage garnishment issues, particularly the potential negative impacts on individuals, such as affecting job prospects, especially in roles requiring security clearance. Concerns were raised about the process being too broad, potentially affecting those who consistently pay child support. Attorney Bristen clarified that wage garnishment requires court approval and is not automatic unless specified in the court order. The committee debated whether the state’s requirement for wage garnishment is federally mandated or a state-level decision, with plans to investigate further.

The meeting concluded with the committee agreeing to draft a report summarizing their findings, including the LBA audit document and the court’s role in Title IV-related matters. The draft report will be circulated for feedback before the final vote on October 22, 2024. The committee expressed gratitude to Attorney Bristen and the department for their assistance in navigating the complex issues.
