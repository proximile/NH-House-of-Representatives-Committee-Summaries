### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Special Committee on the Division for Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF) Meeting (10/17/2024)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Special Committee on the Division for Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF) convened on October 17, 2024, to address critical issues related to DCYF’s practices, oversight, and the need for systemic reforms. The meeting included testimonies from parents, discussions on legal and policy challenges, and proposals for legislative action. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points and themes discussed across all segments:

---

#### **1. Confidentiality, Legal Issues, and Due Process**
- **Confidentiality Breaches**: Concerns were raised about DCYF and courts breaching confidentiality, with discrepancies noted between administrative rules and statutes. Parents can now release information if the child’s name is redacted, per RSA 170-G, but DCYF follows more restrictive administrative rules.
- **Due Process and Constitutional Rights**: Representative Leah Kushman emphasized the lack of due process in DCYF and family court proceedings, particularly the denial of the right to a trial by jury in child abuse or neglect cases. She argued that current practices sidestep constitutional rights and impose severe punishments without proper judicial oversight.
- **Parental Rights**: Testimonies highlighted instances where parents felt their rights were violated, with children removed without meeting the legal standard of “imminent danger.” The committee acknowledged the delicate balance between protecting children’s rights and respecting parental rights.

---

#### **2. Systemic Issues and Parent Testimonies**
- **Parent Experiences**: Multiple parents shared harrowing experiences with DCYF, including the removal of children due to homelessness or other issues. Miss Glenn, a grandmother, detailed how her grandchildren were taken despite her efforts to provide stability, criticizing DCYF for failing to offer adequate support, such as shelter or housing assistance, before removal.
- **Trauma and Lack of Support**: Parents emphasized the emotional and psychological trauma inflicted on children placed in foster care, with one case involving a 14-year-old son suffering significant distress.
- **Transparency and Accountability**: Allegations surfaced of DCYF employees forging or hiding records, failing to document interactions, and not following policies. Parents and advocates argued that DCYF prioritizes removing children over providing resources to keep families together.

---

#### **3. Foster Care and Administrative Rules**
- **Restrictive Rules**: The administrative rules governing foster care were criticized for being overly restrictive, with calls to align them with less restrictive legislative statutes.
- **Unlicensed Foster Homes**: Specific cases were cited where children were placed in unlicensed foster homes, raising concerns about enforcement and oversight.

---

#### **4. Whistleblower Protection and Internal Accountability**
- **Retaliation and Lack of Protection**: The meeting highlighted the lack of protection for DCYF whistleblowers, who often face retaliation or termination for exposing wrongdoing. This has created a culture where systemic issues persist without being addressed.
- **Legislative Role**: The committee discussed the need for the legislature to take a more active investigative role in cases where other branches fail to provide adequate protection.

---

#### **5. Proposed Reforms and Legislative Recommendations**
- **Separating DCYF’s Roles**: Representative Kushman proposed significant reforms, including removing DCYF from child abuse investigations and limiting its role to providing voluntary services like family therapy and parenting classes. Child abuse investigations would be returned to law enforcement to ensure due process.
- **Funding and Conflicts of Interest**: Recommendations were made to ensure all DCYF funding and abuse prosecutions come from the state budget, avoiding conflicts of interest from federal programs.
- **Legislative Proposals**:
  - **LSR 35**: Establish DCYF as a standalone state agency for greater oversight and transparency.
  - **LSR 65**: Address penalties for filing false reports.
  - **LSR 139**: Require DCYF to notify law enforcement of assaults or attempted assaults on children.
- **Transparency Measures**: Proposals included equipping social workers with body cameras and exempting the public from wiretapping laws when recording government servants to ensure accountability.

---

#### **6. Oversight and Enforcement**
- **Subpoena Power**: The committee discussed the legislature’s authority to issue subpoenas and warrants to compel witness attendance and enforce compliance, recommending amendments to house rules to grant subpoena power to committees.
- **Diffuse Oversight Structure**: Concerns were raised about DCYF’s diffuse oversight structure, which reports to multiple committees and agencies, leading to conflicts and inefficiencies.
- **Bills of Address**: The committee explored the ability to issue bills of address to address misconduct by state employees.

---

#### **7. Legal and Policy Challenges**
- **Federal Lawsuit**: The Attorney General’s office faces a conflict of interest as it both investigates DCYF and defends it in court, compromising transparency and accountability.
- **Policy and Law Enforcement**: Discussions emphasized the need for DCYF to follow its own policies and laws, with calls for improved enforcement mechanisms.

---

#### **8. Future Directions**
- **Committee Charge**: The committee was established to review DCYF practices and make recommendations for future legislation, focusing on due process and accountability.
- **Next Steps**: The committee plans to review DCYF’s structure, laws, and policies to identify areas for improvement and explore mechanisms to compel DCYF’s participation in future hearings.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored deep concerns about DCYF’s practices, including lack of transparency, accountability, and adherence to due process. The committee emphasized the need for significant reforms to protect families, ensure constitutional rights, and improve oversight. Proposed legislative actions aim to address systemic issues, enhance transparency, and balance the rights of children and parents. The chair expressed hope for progress in separating DCYF’s roles and scheduled further discussions to advance these critical reforms.
