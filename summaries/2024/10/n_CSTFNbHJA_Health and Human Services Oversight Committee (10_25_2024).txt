### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Health and Human Services Oversight Committee Meeting (10/25/2024)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Health and Human Services Oversight Committee convened on October 25, 2024, to address a wide range of issues related to mental health, Medicaid, dental care, and emerging medical technologies. The meeting focused on improving access to care, addressing workforce challenges, and ensuring the effective use of state and federal funds. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

#### **1. Mental Health Services and Managed Care**
- **Managed Care Contract Restructuring**: The committee discussed the restructured Managed Care contract, which impacts Community Mental Health Centers (CMHCs). Despite budget constraints since 2011, CMHCs are required to serve all individuals regardless of their ability to pay, leading to waitlists. Efforts are ongoing to address financial challenges and ensure coverage for patients who lose insurance.
- **Federal Funding and Enhanced Match**: Participation in the Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic (CCBHC) demonstration program provides an enhanced federal match, supporting CMHCs in Nashua and Manchester. This funding helps address care obligations and financial sustainability.
- **Restoration of Competency Program**: The committee highlighted the lack of a formal program to restore competency for individuals incarcerated longer than their potential sentences due to mental health issues. Collaborative efforts with state bureaus were emphasized to address this gap.
- **Solution Health Psychiatric Hospital**: The rejection of a freestanding psychiatric hospital in Londonderry by the town council was discussed. ARPA funds initially allocated for the project were redirected to transitional housing for young adults at New Hampshire Hospital, helping to alleviate acute care needs.

#### **2. Medicaid and Insurance Coverage**
- **Insurance Coverage and Redeterminations**: Delays in Medicaid eligibility redeterminations were identified as a challenge affecting CMHCs' financial stability. The committee also focused on closing gaps in coverage for services like functional supports, which are not always aligned between Medicaid and commercial insurance.
- **Medicaid Rate Increases**: The committee reviewed the impact of Medicaid rate increases on CMHCs, with the goal of achieving 100% of Medicare rates. Additional funding was secured through restructuring managed care contracts to ensure full payment to providers.
- **Postpartum Care and Dental Medicaid Expansion**: The committee discussed the need for more frequent updates on postpartum care and the effectiveness of the Medicaid dental expansion program. The dental program has served over 16,000 members since April 2023, with a focus on preventive care and addressing oral health issues during pregnancy.
- **Medicaid Enhancement for Children and Pregnant Women**: Henry Lipman, State Medicaid Director, provided a quarterly report on expanded postpartum coverage, which now extends to one year. Since its implementation in October 2023, 381 women have utilized the extended coverage.

#### **3. Dental Care and Workforce Challenges**
- **Mobile Dental Clinics**: The mobile dental clinic in Claremont was highlighted for its success in providing services to underserved populations. The addition of another hygienist has increased appointment slots.
- **Provider Engagement and Workforce Challenges**: The committee discussed challenges in recruiting and retaining dental providers, including no-shows and the need for loan forgiveness programs. Efforts are being made to streamline credentialing processes and ensure timely payments to incentivize provider participation in Medicaid.

#### **4. Mental Health 10-Year Plan and Juvenile Justice**
- **Mental Health 10-Year Plan**: The Department of Health and Human Services presented key accomplishments from the first half of the 10-year mental health plan, including the expansion of mobile crisis services, the implementation of the 988 suicide prevention hotline, and the use of federal funds to build mental health infrastructure.
- **Juvenile Justice and Transitions in Care**: The committee emphasized the importance of connecting youth in the juvenile justice system to community-based mental health services. A new Medicaid benefit will provide targeted case management for adjudicated youth transitioning from the Youth Development Center (YDC) to the community. Similar efforts are being made for former foster children and adults in the correctional system to reduce recidivism and improve community ties.

#### **5. Emerging Medical Technology**
- **Emerging Medical Technology Study Committee Report**: Representative Jess Edwards provided an update on the Emerging Medical Technology Study Committee, which held its inaugural meeting in September. The committee aims to gain subject matter expertise and consider enabling legislation for clinical trials and medical technology use in the state.

#### **6. New Hampshire Hospital Updates**
- **High-Security Unit Construction**: Ellen Leo, CEO of New Hampshire Hospital, provided an update on the high-security unit construction project. The unit will serve civilly committed individuals, those involved in the criminal justice system with serious mental illness, and individuals deemed incompetent to stand trial due to mental illness. Discussions also addressed the ethical implications of competency restoration for trial purposes.

#### **7. Recognition and Awards**
- **Health and Human Services IT Systems**: The department received an A-minus grade from the Center for Digital Government for its work in Health and Human Services Information Technology systems, particularly the rapid implementation of the adult dental benefit.
- **American Dental Association (ADA)**: Dr. Richard Rado, an oral surgeon from New Hampshire, was elected president-elect of the ADA, highlighting the stateâ€™s contributions to national dental health efforts.

#### **8. Future Meetings and Reporting**
