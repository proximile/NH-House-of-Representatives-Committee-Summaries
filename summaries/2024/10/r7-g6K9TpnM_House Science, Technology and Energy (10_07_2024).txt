**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Science, Technology, and Energy Committee Meeting (10/07/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee convened on October 7, 2024, for its final meeting of the session, addressing a broad range of topics related to energy, infrastructure, technology, and legislative priorities. The meeting began with the Pledge of Allegiance and included discussions on interim study bills, updates on committee work, and reflections on the session’s accomplishments.

### **Key Discussions and Updates:**

1. **Energy and Infrastructure Funding:**  
   - Representative McGee highlighted the availability of unspent ARPA funds, suggesting they could be allocated to water infrastructure improvements, particularly in response to recent flooding and aging systems. Discussions also focused on equitable funding mechanisms for lake-related infrastructure, such as shoreline assessment fees and boat registration fees, given that most New Hampshire lakes are connected to dams.

2. **Committee Updates and Acknowledgements:**  
   - Representative Plosje provided an update on the Committee to Study the Feasibility and Impact of a New Hampshire Clean Energy Community Resilience and Conservation Corps, noting that a report on House Bill 1499 is due by November 1st.  
   - As the final meeting of the committee, members expressed gratitude and appreciation for their colleagues' contributions, particularly outgoing members. Representative McWilliams, a six-year member, acknowledged the collaborative efforts and progress made in advancing the state's energy policy. The meeting concluded with thanks to substitutes, commendations for Chairman Bowes, and well-wishes for reelection campaigns. Members also anticipated reconvening for Veto Day later in the week.

### **Interim Study Bills:**

The committee evaluated five interim study bills, providing non-binding recommendations to guide future legislative efforts:

1. **HB 509: Phasing Out the Minimum Electric Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS):**  
   - The bill proposed phasing out the RPS over five years, citing consumer freedom as a rationale. Opponents raised concerns about the economic impact on renewable energy businesses and the lack of analysis on the effects of phasing out the RPS. The committee voted 10-7 to **not recommend** the bill.

2. **HB 1398: Utility Recovery of Costs Associated with Net Energy Metering:**  
   - This bill aimed to extend a cost recovery mechanism used by Eversource to other utilities. While supporters argued for transparency, opponents noted that the Public Utilities Commission was already addressing the issue. The committee voted 10-7 to **not recommend** the bill.

3. **HB 1508: Prioritizing Fiber Optic Service Restoration for Public Safety:**  
   - The bill required fiber optic providers to prioritize restoring service for public safety organizations. Concerns were raised about the state's jurisdiction over private companies and the lack of enforcement mechanisms. The committee voted 9-8 to **not recommend** the bill.

4. **HB 1617: Energy Procurement Agreements for Default Service:**  
   - The bill proposed studying the process of setting default service rates. The committee unanimously voted to **not recommend** the bill, as the Public Utilities Commission was already addressing the issue.

5. **SB 540: Investigating Energy Storage Technologies:**  
   - This bill called for a study on battery storage technologies. Supporters argued it was essential for future energy planning, while opponents questioned the need for a costly study given ongoing projects. The committee voted 9-8 to **recommend** the bill for future legislation.

### **Additional Key Topics:**

- **Transmission Upgrades:** Representative Harrington highlighted a $400 million project to upgrade transmission infrastructure, emphasizing the lack of oversight on costs and need. He proposed legislation to require the Site Evaluation Committee to consider cost and necessity for future projects.

- **Artificial Intelligence and Energy:** Representative Munns discussed the growing energy demands of artificial intelligence and its impact on power markets.  
- **Cybersecurity and Quantum Computing:** Representative Summers raised concerns about quantum computing’s potential to break current encryption systems, emphasizing the need for new security measures.  
- **Commission Updates:** Representative Vose provided updates on the commission studying the assessment of power generation, aiming to reduce litigation by removing the Department of Revenue Administration from the process.
