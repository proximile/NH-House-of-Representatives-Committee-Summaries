**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Committee Meeting on the Housing Crisis for People with Disabilities (10/22/2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened a committee meeting on October 22, 2024, to address the housing crisis impacting people with disabilities. The meeting featured testimonies, policy discussions, and presentations on programs like the NH ABLE Savings Plan, highlighting the urgent need for accessible, affordable, and sustainable housing solutions. Key themes and takeaways from the meeting are summarized below:

---

### **1. Testimonies on Housing Challenges**
- **Personal Experiences**: Speakers shared personal stories of the difficulties in finding accessible and affordable housing. Issues included the high cost of renting one-bedroom apartments, the lack of ADA-compliant housing, and the need for retrofitting existing buildings to meet accessibility standards.
- **Section 8 Housing Vouchers**: Testimonies emphasized the financial struggles of low-income individuals with disabilities relying on Section 8 vouchers. Advocates called for expanding the voucher program to support independent living in the community rather than institutional settings.
- **Neighborhood and Accessibility Concerns**: Concerns were raised about neighbors' resistance to group homes and the lack of fully accessible features in rental properties, such as shower lifts.

### **2. Policy and Funding Solutions**
- **Affordable Housing Fund**: The committee discussed increasing funding for affordable housing and operationalizing the Supportive Housing Medicaid benefit.
- **Rental vs. Ownership Models**: While renting remains common due to high costs, there is a growing shift toward owning properties to ensure long-term stability, supported by ARPA funding.
- **Local vs. State Control**: The need for the state to set reasonable standards for local municipalities was emphasized to prevent over-regulation that limits housing options for people with disabilities.
- **Universal Design and Community Integration**: Advocacy for universal design principles and community-based housing models was a recurring theme, promoting self-determination and independence for individuals with disabilities.

### **3. NH ABLE Savings Program**
- **Overview**: The NH ABLE Plan, presented by Chuck Seaya and Monica Mapelli, is a savings program that allows individuals with disabilities to save money without jeopardizing needs-based benefits like SSI and Medicaid. Established in 2017, the program has 1,184 account holders with $11.5 million in assets.
- **Key Features**: ABLE accounts allow annual contributions of up to $18,000 (with additional contributions for working individuals) for qualified disability expenses, including housing, transportation, and personal support services. The program eliminates the $2,000 asset limit, enabling individuals to save without losing benefits.
- **Housing-Related Uses**: ABLE accounts can be used for rent, mortgage payments, and utilities without affecting eligibility for housing benefits like Section 8 vouchers.
- **Challenges**: Despite its benefits, awareness and utilization of the ABLE program remain limited. Efforts are ongoing to promote the program, especially among families and individuals with disabilities.

### **4. Barriers and Advocacy**
- **Accessibility Issues**: Using existing buildings for housing often creates barriers for individuals with disabilities, particularly regarding accessibility and clinical needs.
- **Shared Living Model Limitations**: Sue Soby of Easter Seals New Hampshire highlighted the challenges of the shared living model, where individuals with developmental and intellectual disabilities live in private homes with caregivers. Issues include frequent moves, homelessness, and emergency placements due to funding gaps and rising rents.
- **Call for Action**: Advocates urged the committee to explore funding streams, address regulatory barriers, and ensure long-term fiscal sustainability for housing solutions, particularly for those with high support needs.

---

### **5. Committee Discussion and Next Steps**
- **Interim Report**: The committee discussed drafting an interim report, considering key findings on affordability, accessibility, and barriers to housing. Recommendations for future action will be included.
- **Additional Work Session**: Members debated holding an additional work session before November 1 to finalize the report and agreed to meet again for further discussion.
- **Accessibility Definitions**: The committee explored the definition of "facility" in housing for disabled individuals, particularly how the number of rooms or beds might affect accessibility requirements, and whether this issue warrants further investigation.

### **6. Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the urgent need for comprehensive solutions to address the housing crisis for people with disabilities in New Hampshire. Key priorities include increasing accessible and affordable housing options, expanding funding and support programs like Section 8 vouchers and the ABLE Plan, and advocating for policy changes to promote community integration and self-determination. The committeeâ€™s efforts to draft an interim report and explore actionable recommendations reflect a commitment to addressing these critical issues.

The meeting concluded with plans for a follow-up work session to continue drafting the report and advancing solutions to the housing crisis.
