The New Hampshire House Finance Committee met on October 23, 2024, to review several bills that had been placed in interim study. Key discussions and decisions included:

1. **Senate Bill 453**: The committee discussed the bill, which was amended and incorporated into HB 463 but died in the Committee of Conference. The Deputy Secretary of State indicated that HAVA funds were available for the election portal, making the bill potentially unnecessary. After debate, the committee voted 9-8 **not to recommend further legislation** on SB 453.

2. **Senate Bill 553**: The bill's language was incorporated into HB 1241, which was signed into law. A minor change in wording was noted. The committee voted 17-0 **not to recommend further legislation** on SB 553.

3. **House Bill 1595**: This bill, related to child support guidelines, was combined with HB 1564, which passed and became law. After discussion, the committee voted 9-8 **not to recommend further legislation** on HB 1595.

4. **Senate Bill 239**: The bill addressed harm reduction services and passed the House with amendments. The committee initially voted 8-9 against recommending further legislation, but a subsequent motion to **not recommend further legislation** passed 9-8.

The meeting concluded with acknowledgments of members' hard work and contributions, especially those not returning for the next session, and a commitment to continue striving for effective governance and budgeting.
