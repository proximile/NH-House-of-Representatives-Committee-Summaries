The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on November 12, 2024, for the Governor's Operating Budget Hearing, focusing on the fiscal years 2026-2027. The meeting covered a wide range of topics, including budget overviews, departmental presentations, and discussions on key challenges and priorities across state agencies. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key points:

---

### **1. Opening Remarks and Budget Context**
The session began with acknowledgments of the post-election transition to a new governor, highlighting New Hampshire’s smooth transition process and continuity in agency operations. The state’s strong financial position was emphasized, including surpluses in the Education Trust Fund and the Rainy Day Fund, reduced state debt, and an improved credit rating. The pro-growth, pro-business model was credited for driving economic success. The importance of the budget process in addressing agency needs, public testimony, and legislative oversight was underscored.

### **2. Departmental Budget Presentations**
#### **Department of Revenue Administration (DRA):**
Commissioner Stephanie Rauscher presented the DRA’s budget, focusing on maintaining operations, reducing positions, and transitioning the Revenue Information Management System (RIMS) to a cloud-based platform. The DRA highlighted its cost-effectiveness, with a collection cost of just over 0.5% of revenue collected. RIMS has generated significant revenue uplift ($31.1 million since implementation) through features like automated payment reminders and federal tax information integration. The DRA requested additional funding for RIMS support, audit positions, and a paralegal in the hearings bureau.

#### **Department of Justice (DOJ):**
Attorney General John Formella outlined the DOJ’s budget, emphasizing its roles in law enforcement, prosecution, legal defense, and public protection. The budget includes no new positions and focuses on maintaining existing operations. The DOJ’s organizational structure includes divisions for public protection, legal counsel, and the chief medical examiner. The budget accounts for increased federal grant funds for subgranting and higher fees associated with the chief medical examiner’s operations.

#### **Employment Security and Retirement System:**
The Employment Security department discussed its job training fund, which provides financial support to employers and job seekers. The unemployment trust fund is healthy, with around $400 million, due to low unemployment claim volumes and growth in employment establishments. The New Hampshire Retirement System (NHRS) highlighted its modest pension benefits (average annual pension of $23,000) and its strategic plan to address deferred initiatives and IT modernization. The NHRS has achieved an average annual net return of 7% over the last 10 years but faces challenges with recent lower returns.

#### **Liquor Commission and Department of Agriculture:**
The Liquor Commission emphasized self-funding and competition from neighboring states, discussing the impact of cannabis legalization on liquor sales and the need for a new licensing platform. The Department of Agriculture outlined its budget, which includes reductions in several programs to meet efficiency targets, while modernizing systems like the animal database program.

#### **Banking Department and Veterans Home:**
The Banking Department, a self-funded agency, discussed its budget proposal, emphasizing the need for on-site examinations for consumer protection and training in complex fintech areas. The New Hampshire Veterans Home highlighted its 134-year history, staffing challenges, and efforts to improve recruitment and retention through programs like the Licensed Medication Nursing Assistant (LMNA) program. The facility has capped admissions at 140 due to staffing shortages but plans to expand to 225 beds as staffing improves.

### **3. Law Enforcement and Corrections**
#### **Police Standards and Training:**
Director John Skippa outlined the mission of the Police Academy, which trains and certifies law enforcement officers. The council faces new responsibilities, such as overseeing police misconduct investigations and developing court security officer training programs. Recruitment and retention remain national issues impacting New Hampshire, with a slight uptick in applications.

#### **Department of Corrections:**
Commissioner Helen Hanks presented the department’s budget, emphasizing efforts to reduce recidivism through evidence-based rehabilitation programs. Challenges include aging infrastructure, staffing shortages, and the need for medical and pharmaceutical services. Plans are underway to replace the aging New Hampshire State Prison for Men, with $50 million already appropriated for the project.

### **4. Department of Safety**
The Department of Safety requested $265 million for FY2026 and $273 million for FY2027 to support Public Safety Services. Key divisions include:

- **Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV):** The DMV seeks $34.3 million for FY2026, with 56% going to salaries. Seven positions remain unfunded, which could lead to delays in driver licensing and vehicle registration services.
- **Homeland Security and Emergency Management (HSEM):** The division requested $26.5 million for FY2026, with 72% allocated to operating funds, mostly federal grants.

### **5. Broader State Operations and Challenges**
#### **Department of Administrative Services (DAS):**
The DAS commissioner outlined the department’s broad responsibilities, including retiree health benefits, state budget management, accounting, public works, procurement, and energy management. Significant cost savings were highlighted from transitioning to a Medicare Advantage program for retiree health benefits. The state faces approximately $1 billion in deferred maintenance, with efforts ongoing to prioritize repairs.

#### **Other Agencies:**
- **Office of the Advocate for Special Education:** Ensures federally and state-mandated services for students with IEPs, handling complaints and addressing systemic issues.
- **Conservation Land Stewardship Program (CLS):** Oversees conservation lands and monitors investments, funded through an endowment and contracts.
