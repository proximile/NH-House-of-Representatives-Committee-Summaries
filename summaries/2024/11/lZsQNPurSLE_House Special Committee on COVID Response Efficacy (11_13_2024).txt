### Comprehensive Summary: NH House Special Committee on COVID Response Efficacy (November 13, 2024)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Special Committee on COVID Response Efficacy convened on November 13, 2024, to finalize its evaluation of the state's pandemic response. The bipartisan committee reviewed, debated, and edited both the majority and minority reports, focusing on key issues, findings, and recommendations. The discussions and conclusions from the meeting are summarized below:

#### Key Areas of Discussion and Findings:
1. **Propaganda and State Narratives**:
   - The committee debated whether the state’s promotion of certain narratives during the pandemic, such as stay-at-home orders and vaccine efficacy, constituted propaganda. Members argued that these narratives, regardless of their truthfulness, were used to influence public behavior and instill fear.
   - The state’s extensive marketing efforts, including billboards and commercials encouraging vaccination, were criticized for promoting a specific narrative and limiting open discourse.

2. **Treatment Accessibility and Suppression**:
   - The committee scrutinized the state’s handling of monoclonal antibody treatments, comparing New Hampshire’s restrictive policies to Florida’s more accessible approach. Concerns were raised about equity policies that allegedly prevented some individuals from receiving necessary treatments.
   - The suppression of certain COVID-19 treatments, such as hydroxychloroquine and albuterol, was discussed, with debates over whether these actions should be categorized as censorship or equity measures.

3. **Long COVID and Vaccine Injuries**:
   - Testimony and evidence regarding long COVID and vaccine-related injuries were reviewed. Notably, the committee highlighted that a significant portion of long COVID cases occurred among vaccinated individuals, prompting discussions on whether to include this data in the report.

4. **Economic and Social Disruptions**:
   - The committee emphasized the severe economic and social impacts of COVID-19 measures, including business closures, restrictions on personal liberties, and the shuttering of houses of worship. Members stressed the need to avoid similar overreaches in the future.

5. **Fear and Decision-Making**:
   - Fear was identified as a significant driver of the pandemic response, leading to policy paralysis and reluctance to adapt despite emerging data. The committee underscored the importance of avoiding fear-driven decision-making in future emergencies.

6. **Masks and Government Overreach**:
   - The limited evidence supporting mask efficacy, particularly the use of professionally fitted N95 masks in controlled conditions, was discussed. The committee also expressed concerns about the overreach of executive powers during the pandemic, including the issuance of numerous emergency orders and the bypassing of elected officials.

7. **Adherence to Federal Guidelines**:
   - The committee evaluated the state’s adherence to federal guidelines, noting that measures like mask mandates and social distancing lacked demonstrable impact on the pandemic’s course. Criticism was directed at the indiscriminate application of these measures without adequate justification or evaluation.

#### Recommendations:
1. **Reinstatement of the Committee**:
   - The committee concluded that its work was incomplete and recommended reinstatement in the 2025-2026 legislative session to continue evaluating the state’s pandemic response and its long-term effects.

2. **Future Emergency Planning**:
   - Members called for future emergency planning to be subject to ongoing review and re-evaluation, ensuring that decisions are based on real-time evidence and not driven by fear.

3. **Accountability and Oversight**:
   - The committee emphasized the need for accountability and a reassessment of the chain of command between federal and state officials to prevent overreach and ensure transparency.

4. **Comprehensive Documentation**:
   - The importance of public testimony and comprehensive documentation, including a list of all submitted materials, was acknowledged. The committee suggested expanding its mission to include forward-looking studies on long-term pandemic effects, such as long COVID and speech disabilities in children.

#### Finalization of Reports:
- The committee reviewed and accepted the Democratic members’ **Minority Report**, which expressed disagreement with some findings and recommendations in the majority report. Minor grammatical edits were made for consistency.
- The **Majority Report** was finalized with sections on acknowledgments, summary of findings, recommendations, and specific criticisms of the state’s pandemic response. Edits were made for clarity and accuracy, including standardizing terminology and ensuring the report’s findings were concise and impactful.
- Both reports were adopted after final edits and discussions, with committee members expressing appreciation for the collaborative effort.

#### Conclusion:
The committee’s work highlighted critical areas of concern in New Hampshire’s COVID-19 response, including propaganda, treatment accessibility, government overreach, and the long-term impacts of pandemic measures. By recommending the committee’s reinstatement and calling for future accountability, the members aimed to ensure a more informed and transparent approach to emergency planning and response in the years to come.
