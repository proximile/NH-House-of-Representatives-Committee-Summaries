**Summary of the New Hampshire House Special Committee on COVID Response Efficacy Meeting (11/01/2024)**

On November 1, 2024, the New Hampshire House Special Committee on COVID Response Efficacy convened to review and discuss a draft report evaluating the state’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The bipartisan committee, tasked with conducting a science-based, fact-finding review, focused on assessing the efficacy of measures taken during the pandemic, including federal guidance administration, emergency use authorizations, vaccination efforts, and the economic and educational impacts of the crisis.

### Key Discussions and Outcomes:

1. **Review and Editing of the Draft Report**:  
   Committee members, led by Representative Weary, discussed revisions to the draft report, which included stylistic changes to improve readability and clarify technical concepts such as the Swiss Cheese model and R0 value. No major conclusions or findings were altered, but there was added emphasis on the impact of school closures on early childhood development and socialization. The committee also debated formatting preferences, such as starting each section on a new page and incorporating footnotes or appendices for technical explanations.

2. **Report Structure and Content**:  
   The draft report is organized into three major sections:  
   - **Introduction**: Acknowledges the efforts of state officials and outlines the committee’s mission to evaluate the pandemic response without hindsight bias.  
   - **Policy Areas**: Examines the goals set during the pandemic, the disruption caused by state actions, and the impacts on education, government functioning, and economic stability.  
   - **Specific Measures**: Reviews mitigation strategies like social distancing, masking, closures, and vaccination efforts.  

3. **Findings and Recommendations**:  
   The committee acknowledged that while the initial goal of halting the spread of COVID-19 was not achieved, efforts to prevent healthcare system overload and buy time for treatment development were more successful. However, there was limited evidence to prove the effectiveness of specific measures. The draft report includes recommendations for future policy decisions, such as independently verifying federal guidance and addressing long-term impacts like long COVID and vaccine injuries.

4. **Disagreements and Consensus**:  
   While there was general agreement on the report’s structure and content, some committee members expressed disagreements with certain conclusions and the overall tone. The committee recognized the challenge of reaching a consensus due to differing perspectives but remained committed to producing a balanced and comprehensive report.

5. **Appendices and References**:  
   Members discussed enhancing the report’s credibility and accessibility by adding appendices, including hyperlinks to key documents, witness testimonies, and executive orders related to the pandemic.

6. **Federal Funds Dissemination**:  
   The committee briefly touched on the issue of federal funds distribution during the pandemic, deciding to reference existing executive branch analyses rather than duplicating efforts.

7. **Next Steps and Scheduling**:  
   The committee scheduled a follow-up meeting for November 13, 2024, at 9:00 a.m. to finalize the report. Members were encouraged to review the edited draft and provide feedback. The meeting concluded at 11:39 a.m., with members wishing each other well for the upcoming elections and the next session.

### Personal Circumstances:  
Representative Weary shared that he was dealing with the recent loss of his father and requested time to address outstanding issues after the following week.

### Overall Focus:  
The meeting underscored the committee’s commitment to producing a thorough, balanced, and accessible report that evaluates New Hampshire’s COVID-19 response, identifies lessons learned, and provides forward-looking recommendations to improve future pandemic preparedness and policy decisions.
