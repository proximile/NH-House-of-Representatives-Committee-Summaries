The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Long Range Capital Planning and Utilization Committee meeting on November 12, 2024, focused on several key agenda items related to the sale and disposal of state-owned properties. Here’s a summary of the main discussions:

1. **Sale of Parcels in Conway and Gilmington**:  
   - The committee discussed the authorization to sell state-owned parcels in Conway and Gilmington. In Conway, the Department of Transportation plans to sell parcels after reaching out to the town and the New Hampshire Housing Finance Authority. In Gilmington, a 1.6-acre property on Route 140 was approved for sale to abutters for $27,000, plus an administrative fee, to resolve an unauthorized driveway issue.

2. **Lease Agreement in Hillsborough County**:  
   - The Department of Administrative Services requested approval to lease 9,433 square feet of state-owned space in the Hillsborough County Superior Court building in Manchester to the Hillsborough County Attorney’s Office for four years, generating $518,700 in revenue. The motion was approved.

3. **Sale of Surplus Property in Hampton**:  
   - The New Hampshire Liquor Commission sought approval to sell approximately 88 acres of surplus property in Hampton, including parcels on both the northbound and southbound sides of Interstate 95. The Liquor Commission plans to retain ownership of the land beneath its liquor stores and the on/off ramps while selling the remaining land to a private developer. The minimum sale price is set at $15 million, with proceeds earmarked to retire bond debt. The committee approved the request after extensive discussion about the development plans and the process.

4. **Biennial Report Update**:  
   - The committee reviewed a draft of the biennial report, which summarizes the committee’s activities and updates the value of properties disposed of since its inception. The final report will be submitted by December 1, 2024.

5. **Adjournment**:  
   - The meeting concluded with a motion to adjourn, which was approved unanimously.

Throughout the meeting, committee members asked detailed questions about property values, development plans, and the financial implications of the proposed sales and leases. The discussions highlighted the state’s efforts to manage its real estate assets effectively while ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.
