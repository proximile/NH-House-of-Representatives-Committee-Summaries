7. **Osborne Amendment (Rule 44 – Tabling Calendar)**:  
   Representative Osborne proposed creating a "tabling calendar" to streamline the legislative process by allowing committees to table bills without a public hearing if three-quarters of the committee agreed. The amendment passed 5-4 despite concerns about limiting debate.

### **Late Bill Drafting Requests**

### **Other Key Discussions**

3. **Second Committee Referrals**:  
   A rule change aimed to prevent the chair of a second committee from unilaterally waiving a bill without a committee vote, ensuring thorough review. Opponents argued it could hinder efficiency.

4. **Decorum in Debate**:  
   A rule amendment was proposed to allow members to refer to the Senate or Governor directly during debates, rather than using euphemisms. While seen as a way to improve clarity, concerns about maintaining decorum were raised.
