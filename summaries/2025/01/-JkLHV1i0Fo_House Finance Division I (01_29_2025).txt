Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and decisions from the seven segments of the meeting:

### **1. New Hampshire Retirement System (NHRS)**
The NHRS, a cornerstone of the state’s financial planning, was a major focus of the meeting. Key updates included:
- **Pension Plan Improvements**: Enhanced education and outreach efforts, a new five-year strategic plan for investments, and the growth of the "My Account" online portal to over 31,000 users.
- **Employer Reporting**: Structural changes assigned NHRS relationship managers to improve efficiency, with employer listening sessions providing valuable feedback.
- **Investment Strategy**: The NHRS maintains a diversified portfolio with a focus on long-term growth and reducing volatility. The assumed rate of return is 6.75%, impacting employer contributions and unfunded liabilities.
- **Unfunded Liability**: Efforts to reduce the $5.6 billion unfunded liability (as of FY 2024) are ongoing, with a goal to achieve 100% funding by 2039.
- **Transparency and Performance**: NHRS emphasizes transparency, discloses investment managers, and conducts actuarial audits. It has outperformed 84% of its peers over 15 years.
- **New Building Purchase**: NHRS is relocating to a new $5 million building in Concord, with completion expected by March 2026.

### **2. State Operations and Procurement**
The state’s procurement and financial management systems were discussed, including:
- **Bulk Purchasing**: A century-old system that ensures cost efficiency for commodities like salt and aggregate, often in collaboration with the Department of Transportation (DOT).
- **ERP System Upgrade**: The New Hampshire First ERP system, the backbone of HR, payroll, and finance operations, is being upgraded to the cloud using ARPA funds.
- **ARPA Funding**: $75 million in ARPA funds were allocated for one-time projects, including HVAC upgrades, deferred maintenance, and the establishment of a statewide recruitment unit.
- **Paid Family Medical Leave (PFML)**: A voluntary program offering wage replacement benefits, incentivized through tax credits and administered by MetLife.
- **Staffing Challenges**: Despite a 2% budget increase from 2019 to 2025, staffing levels have remained flat, with significant pay raises contributing to salary and benefits costs.

### **3. Environmental Programs and Financial Management**
The Department of Environmental Services (DES) highlighted its efforts in environmental protection and financial sustainability:
- **State Revolving Loan Fund (SRF)**: A significant portion of the DES budget, focusing on wastewater and drinking water projects, primarily funded by federal and state matching funds.
- **PFAS Contamination**: Active programs to address PFAS in water resources, including financial assistance for treatment and alternative water sources.
- **Dam Management**: Challenges in maintaining high-hazard dams, with discussions on potential revenue sources for upgrades.
- **Business Finance Authority (BFA)**: Supports businesses and nonprofits through loan guarantees and tax-exempt bonds, operating independently with fee-based funding.

### **4. Judicial Branch Challenges and Innovations**
The judicial branch faced significant challenges, including budget constraints and increased caseloads:
- **Family Treatment Courts**: Success in reunifying parents with substance use disorders with their children, with expansions in Manchester.
- **Court Security and Efficiency**: Innovative programs like digital evidence platforms and text reminders for court appearances aim to improve efficiency, but budget cuts threaten court security and potential closures of circuit courts.
- **YDC Claims**: A surge in lawsuits related to the Youth Development Center has created a backlog, requiring additional resources to process cases.
- **Budget Constraints**: The judicial branch submitted an efficiency budget with a 4% reduction, leading to cuts in non-judge positions and deferred programs like veterans courts.

### **5. Department of Administrative Services (DAS)**
DAS, a central service agency, focused on its budget, retiree health benefits, and facility management:
- **Retiree Health Benefits**: Strategies to reduce costs, including transitioning retirees to Medicare Advantage plans and introducing premium contributions, have achieved significant savings.
- **Facility Maintenance**: A $1 billion deferred maintenance backlog for state buildings, with only $2-4 million addressed annually.
- **Procurement and Support**: DAS manages statewide procurement and provides HR support to smaller agencies, while larger agencies like HHS handle their own.

### **6. Financial and Judicial Operations**
Key discussions included:
- **Student Loan Forgiveness Program**: Administered by the BFA, offering up to $50,000 in forgiveness for New Hampshire residents working in regenerative medicine.
- **Rustic Crust Bankruptcy**: The state assured minimal losses due to collateral and asset liquidation.
- **Judicial Innovations**: Treatment courts (drug, mental health, veterans) and a new magistrate program to improve efficiency and access to justice.
- **Access to Justice**: Addressing the high percentage of self-represented litigants and public defender shortages through legislative measures like paralegal representation.
