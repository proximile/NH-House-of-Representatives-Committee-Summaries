### Comprehensive Summary: New Hampshire House of Representatives Labor, Industrial, and Rehabilitative Services Committee Meeting on **House Bill 238 FN** (Right to Work Legislation) – January 22, 2025

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Labor, Industrial, and Rehabilitative Services Committee held a hearing on January 22, 2025, to discuss **House Bill 238 FN**, a "Right to Work" bill. The proposed legislation would prohibit collective bargaining agreements from requiring employees to join or financially support a labor union as a condition of employment. The bill, introduced by **Representative Glasson**, sparked extensive debate among lawmakers, union representatives, business leaders, and other stakeholders. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key arguments, testimonies, and themes from the hearing.

### **Key Arguments in Support of the Bill**
1. **Individual Freedom and Choice**:
   - Proponents, including **Representative Glasson** and **Greg Moore** of Americans for Prosperity, argued that the bill empowers workers by allowing them to choose whether to join or financially support a union without facing repercussions. They framed the issue as a matter of personal liberty and worker autonomy.
   - **Pamela Ian**, a former teacher, shared her personal experience with union-mandated fees, stating that workers should not be compelled to join unions or pay dues.

2. **Economic Growth and Business Attraction**:
   - Supporters claimed that "Right to Work" laws would make New Hampshire more competitive, particularly in attracting businesses to underserved areas like the North Country. They cited examples from other states where such laws have led to lower unemployment, increased business investment, and higher cost-of-living-adjusted incomes.
   - **John Calb**, Vice President of the National Right to Work Committee, presented data suggesting that "Right to Work" states experience higher job growth and economic investment compared to non-"Right to Work" states.

3. **Union Responsiveness**:
   - Proponents argued that the bill would make unions more responsive to their members by eliminating mandatory dues, thereby forcing unions to earn their support through effective representation.

### **Key Arguments in Opposition to the Bill**
1. **Weakening Unions and Collective Bargaining**:
   - Opponents, including **Richard Gulla** of the State Employees Association and **Keith Judge** of Teamsters Local 633, argued that the bill would weaken unions by creating financial instability. They emphasized that unions are democratically chosen by workers and provide essential benefits like healthcare, retirement, and training.
   - **Tom Eaton**, a union member, highlighted the benefits of union jobs, including better wages, benefits, and safety standards, and warned that the bill would undermine these advantages.

2. **Economic and Social Harm**:
   - Opponents cited studies showing that "Right to Work" states often have lower wages, higher poverty rates, and worse working conditions. They argued that such laws benefit corporate interests at the expense of workers and would lead to a "race to the bottom."
   - **Lisa Bodwin**, Executive Director of the New Hampshire Council of Churches, emphasized the importance of unions in upholding workers' dignity, fair wages, and safe working conditions.

3. **Free Rider Problem**:
   - Opponents stressed that unions are legally required to represent all employees in a bargaining unit, even non-members, which creates a "free rider" problem if employees are not required to pay dues or fees. **Janice Kelby**, a retired postal worker, argued that non-union workers often benefit from union-negotiated contracts without contributing to union dues.

4. **Historical and Social Context**:
   - Several speakers, including union members and representatives, highlighted the racist origins of "Right to Work" laws, which were designed to undermine unions and maintain racial divisions in the workplace. They referenced Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s criticism of such laws.

### **Economic and Workforce Impact**
1. **Economic Data**:
   - Supporters cited studies, including a Harvard University study, suggesting that "Right to Work" laws lead to higher employment rates, reduced poverty, and increased labor force participation.
   - Opponents countered with data showing that workers in "Right to Work" states earn, on average, 12% less than those in non-"Right to Work" states and that such laws increase workplace fatalities by 43.8%.

2. **Workforce Development**:
   - Opponents, including **Kristen Bowen** of the Electrical Contractors Association, emphasized the value of union apprenticeship programs and training initiatives. They warned that the bill would harm workforce development and reduce the availability of skilled labor.

### **Personal Testimonies**
1. **Union Members’ Stories**:
   - Union members shared personal stories of how unions transformed their lives, providing stable careers, benefits, and a sense of community. **Mike King**, a retired union ironworker, credited union benefits for allowing him to retire with dignity.
   - **Keith Judge** shared a personal story of how union-negotiated benefits saved his life during a health crisis, emphasizing the importance of collective bargaining.

2. **Business Community’s Perspective**:
   - **Kim Hokinson**, representing the North Atlantic States Regional Council of Carpenters, read a letter signed by eight New Hampshire companies opposing the bill. They argued that "Right to Work" laws interfere with free market negotiations and harm union training programs.

### **Philosophical and Legislative Debates**
1. **Democratic Nature of Unions**:
   - Several speakers, including **Mark Hayward**, emphasized that unions are democratic organizations where members can advocate for change if dissatisfied. They argued that workers already have the choice to join or leave unions and that the bill is unnecessary.

2. **Federal vs. State Law**:
   - There was debate over whether the bill aligns with federal labor laws, particularly the National Labor Relations Act. Some questioned if the bill’s language needed amendment to reflect federal protections.

3. **Historical Context**:
   - Opponents noted that similar "Right to Work" legislation has been repeatedly proposed and defeated in New Hampshire since 1947, indicating bipartisan recognition of the value of unions.

### **Conclusion**
The hearing highlighted a deep divide between those who view unions as essential for protecting workers' rights and those who see "Right to Work" laws as a necessary safeguard for individual liberty. The committee heard passionate arguments on both sides, with opponents warning of the potential harm to workers and supporters framing the issue as a matter of personal freedom. The committee decided to postpone the executive session on HB 238 to January 28, 2025, to allow members to thoroughly review the testimony and materials. The final decision will depend on the committee's assessment of these competing perspectives, reflecting broader national tensions over labor rights, economic policy, and the role of unions in the workplace.
