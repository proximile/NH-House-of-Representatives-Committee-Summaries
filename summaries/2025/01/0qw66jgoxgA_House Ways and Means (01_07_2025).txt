### **Committee Orientation and Overview**
The meeting began with introductions from committee members, who shared their professional backgrounds, prior committee experience, and personal careers in fields such as education, public health, real estate, and military service. Chair John Janigian outlined the committee’s primary responsibilities, which include:
- Generating revenue estimates for the upcoming biennium, a process that involves analyzing data from state departments and economic trends.
- Reviewing bills related to taxes and fees, with a workflow that includes public hearings, work sessions, and executive sessions for final voting.

The chair emphasized the importance of respectful and collaborative discussions, particularly during public hearings, and introduced key staff members who provide research and administrative support. Members were also briefed on accessing committee materials online, including the monthly *Revenue Focus* report, which tracks state revenue trends.

### **Presentations and Discussions on Tax Issues**
The committee engaged in detailed discussions on various tax-related topics, featuring presentations from the New Hampshire Society of CPAs and other experts. Key points included:

1. **Economic Nexus and Apportionment**:
   - Companies must determine if they have a physical or economic nexus in a state, which subjects them to that state’s tax laws.
   - New Hampshire uses a "single sales factor" for apportionment, allocating net profits based solely on sales in the state.

2. **Market-Based Sourcing**:
   - New Hampshire has adopted market-based sourcing, taxing income based on where the customer receives the benefit rather than where the work is performed.
   - This approach has introduced complexities, particularly for industries like software development, where services are delivered across multiple states.

3. **Unitary Filing and Foreign Income**:
   - Businesses with interrelated operations across states may be required to file a unitary return.
   - New Hampshire follows a "waters edge" approach, taxing foreign income only when it enters the state, though recent federal changes, such as the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) provision, have introduced some inclusion of foreign income on state tax returns.

4. **COVID-19 and Remote Work**:
   - The pandemic raised questions about tax jurisdiction for remote workers, with states like Massachusetts and New York taxing employees who worked remotely from other states.
   - New Hampshire has not yet effectively mitigated this issue.

5. **Business Taxes**:
   - **Joel Albre** discussed the now-defunct interest and dividends tax, suggesting that if reinstated, it should be simplified and renamed to avoid confusion.
   - He also explained the Business Enterprise Tax (BET) and its relationship with the Business Profits Tax (BPT), highlighting BET’s low tax rate and its role in stabilizing business tax revenues.
   - **Corey Reynolds** provided an overview of the BPT, detailing its calculation, including adjustments from federal taxable income, compensation deductions, and depreciation differences.

6. **Multi-State Business Taxation**:
   - **Kevin Kennedy** addressed the complexities of multi-state taxation, including the concept of Nexus and the challenges posed by varying state tax laws.

### **Revenue Implications and Future Focus**
The committee discussed the revenue implications of recent tax changes, such as the shift to market-based sourcing and single sales factor apportionment, which were intended to capture revenue from out-of-state companies with customers in New Hampshire. However, the full revenue impact of these changes is still being evaluated.

The meeting concluded with plans for future sessions to:
- Finalize revenue estimates for the upcoming biennium by mid-February.
- Continue discussions on simplifying the tax code, the impact of tax changes on state revenue, and the feasibility of implementing a flat tax.
- Collaborate with state departments and the New Hampshire Society of CPAs to address tax-related challenges.

### **Next Steps**
The committee scheduled upcoming meetings, including sessions with state departments and the New Hampshire Society of CPAs, to further explore tax-related matters. The chair reiterated the importance of balancing fairness, simplicity, and revenue generation to ensure New Hampshire remains an attractive place for businesses while maintaining its unique tax structure.

The meeting concluded with plans for lunch and an afternoon session with the Society of CPAs, followed by discussions on scheduling future committee activities.
