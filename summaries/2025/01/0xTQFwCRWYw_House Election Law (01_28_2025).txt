**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Election Law Meeting (January 28, 2025)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on January 28, 2025, to discuss a wide range of election-related bills and constitutional amendments. The meeting focused on enhancing election integrity, transparency, and accessibility while addressing emerging challenges such as technology, procedural gaps, and voting rights. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **Election Integrity and Security**
1. **House Bill 630**: Introduced by Representative Tom Corman, this bill aims to prevent the dissemination of deep fake materials targeting political candidates before elections. It expands existing laws to include synthetic media created by non-AI technologies. Professor Hany Farid, a digital media forensics expert, supported the bill, emphasizing that manipulated digital content is a broader issue than just AI-generated deep fakes.

2. **House Bill 626**: This bill directs the Secretary of State to implement a vulnerability disclosure program for election systems, allowing security researchers to assess and report vulnerabilities transparently. The Secretary of State supported the bill but requested a provision to address vulnerabilities before public disclosure.

3. **House Bill 448**: This bill proposes establishing a committee to study election law violations identified during the April 2023 ballot law commission. Representative JD Bernardi highlighted over 100 documented violations, including issues with absentee ballots, chain of custody, and voter registration. The bill calls for additional training, auditing, and penalties to improve election integrity. The Secretary of State emphasized the importance of transparency but cautioned against punitive measures for technical errors.

### **Transparency and Accountability**
1. **House Bill 389**: Introduced by Representative Heath Howard, this bill mandates that candidates attest they have not spent or received more than $1,000 in an election if they are exempt from filing detailed financial reports. The bill aims to standardize the process and improve transparency, as nearly half of state representative candidates and a significant number of Senate candidates did not file financial reports in 2022.

2. **House Bill 474**: Sponsored by Representative Claudian Burnham, this bill requires a second witness during the counting of write-in votes to ensure bipartisan oversight. Concerns were raised about the burden on moderators and the potential politicization of the process, especially in nonpartisan elections. The New Hampshire Municipal Association opposed the bill due to its vagueness and additional administrative burden.

### **Procedural Improvements**
1. **House Bill 327**: This bill addresses practical challenges in the election filing process, such as limited Clerk's office hours and the lack of notary services in small towns. It proposes allowing candidates to file directly with the Secretary of State and permitting Town clerks to witness affidavits without being notaries. The Secretary of State’s office supported the bill but suggested simplifying the language regarding Clerk's office hours.

2. **House Bill 336**: This bill clarifies the placement of political advertisements on public rights of way. Representative Judy Aaron introduced the bill following a confusing incident in Claremont during the previous election cycle, where political signs were removed and then reinstated after legal disputes. The New Hampshire Municipal Association supported the bill, arguing it would provide clarity and consistency.

3. **House Bill 423**: This bill addresses the consent required for placing political advertisements on public property, particularly near private property. Representative Wier introduced the bill, sharing personal experiences of removing political signs placed near his property without permission. The bill aims to clarify the rights of property owners and abutters.

### **Political Advertising and Media**
1. **House Bill 107**: This bill sought to remove the requirement for political advertisements in newspapers, periodicals, and billboards to be labeled as such. Representative Perez argued that it was unfair to hold publishers responsible for the content of political ads. Opposition testimony from Kaye of Open Democracy emphasized the importance of transparency and voter awareness, warning that removing labeling requirements could lead to misinformation.

2. **House Bill 336**: Discussions also centered on the placement of political signs on public property, with concerns raised about clutter and the need for clear guidelines. Some representatives suggested that towns designate specific areas for political signs during election periods.

### **Constitutional Amendments**
1. **CACR 3**: Introduced by Representative Moffett, this amendment would allow the legislature to authorize recall elections for elected officials before the end of their terms. Supporters argued it would empower citizens to address malfeasance, while opponents raised concerns about potential misuse by extremist groups. The public hearing revealed mixed opinions, with 9 in support and 32 opposed.

2. **CACR 4**: This amendment seeks to clarify voting eligibility by replacing the term "inhabitant" with "legal resident," requiring voters to be at least 18 years old and residing in the place they claim as their domicile. Multiple speakers, including Kaye of Stadio and Olivia Zinc from Open Democracy, opposed the amendment, arguing it could disenfranchise students, homeless individuals, overseas citizens, and elderly voters in nursing homes. They highlighted the ambiguity of the term "legal resident" and its potential conflict with existing statutes.
