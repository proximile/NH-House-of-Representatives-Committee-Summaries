**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting – House Finance Division III (January 30, 2025)**

The New Hampshire House Finance Division III meeting on January 30, 2025, focused on the state’s efforts to address critical issues in mental health, child welfare, and related services. The discussions, led by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and other stakeholders, highlighted progress, challenges, and future priorities in these areas. Key themes included the state’s focus on community-based care, workforce shortages, data-driven accountability, and the need for sustainable funding models. Below is a cohesive summary of the three segments:

---

### **Mental Health Initiatives and Mission Zero**
The state’s “Mission Zero” initiative, aimed at eliminating emergency room boarding for adults awaiting acute mental health care, has made significant but uneven progress. While zero wait times have been achieved on some days, sustaining this remains a challenge. Efforts focus on improving coordination between hospitals and community partners, addressing both the “front door” (access to care) and “back door” (transitioning out of care). Key components include:
- **Community Mental Health Centers (CMHCs)**: These centers are vital in providing community-based care, though some face financial challenges. None are at immediate risk of closing, and the state is working to ensure their sustainability.
- **Crisis Stabilization and Housing**: Expansion of crisis stabilization services and housing support, including landlord incentives, is critical to providing stable environments for individuals with mental health needs.
- **Data and Accountability**: The state monitors data to track progress, showing reduced average wait times and increased bed availability. Dashboards are used to ensure transparency.
- **Prevention and Early Intervention**: The need for preventative measures, especially for youth, was emphasized, alongside strengthening families and community connections.
- **Substance Abuse and Mental Health Overlap**: The intersection of mental health and substance abuse issues was acknowledged, with a call for more recovery beds.
- **Workforce Challenges**: Workforce shortages persist, though retention rates are higher than national averages. Efforts to hire clinical staff and use contracted workers continue.
- **Future Focus**: Continued investment in acute care and preventative services is essential, with a focus on scaling resources appropriately.

### **Children’s Behavioral Health and Juvenile Justice Reform**
The state has seen a significant rise in mental health issues among youth, with 40% of high school students reporting feelings of sadness or hopelessness and 20% considering suicide. To address this, the state has developed a comprehensive system of care, emphasizing prevention, early intervention, and community-based services. Key efforts include:
- **Funding and Programs**: Federal and general funds support programs like CMHCs, care management entities, and residential treatment. Evidence-based practices, such as home visiting programs, are prioritized to prevent escalation into high-cost care.
- **Juvenile Justice Reform**: The state is shifting from punitive measures to providing care for youth with behavioral health issues, reducing reliance on secure facilities and improving outcomes.
- **Data and Accountability**: Improved data collection and analytics are being implemented to measure program effectiveness and identify best practices.
- **Prevention and Protective Factors**: Stable housing, access to food, and supportive relationships are emphasized as protective factors. The state is exploring successful programs from other states, like New Jersey, to strengthen its system of care.
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: There is a need for more analysis to understand the long-term financial impact of preventive programs, particularly in reducing future costs in areas like corrections and special education.

### **Child Welfare and Residential Care**
The Division for Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF) and the Division for Behavioral Health are working to improve child welfare services, with a focus on community-based care and kinship placements. Key initiatives include:
- **Children and Families Oversight**: The Children's Oversight Committee is being reestablished to monitor residential care for children, with data showing 349 children in residential care as of January 7th.
- **Residential Care and Kinship Placements**: The state is prioritizing kinship placements over foster care or residential care to strengthen family relationships and reduce reliance on institutional care.
- **Foster Care and Recruitment**: Foster care rates are significantly lower than residential care costs, and the state is considering higher rates for intensive foster care. Recruitment efforts include marketing campaigns and support services, though challenges like transportation and respite care persist.
- **Juvenile Justice and Residential Treatment**: The state is reducing reliance on residential treatment and secure settings, focusing on community-based care. The new Youth Development Center (YDC) in Hampstead is being built with a smaller footprint and shared services with Dartmouth Health.
- **Community Mental Health Centers**: The state’s 10 CMHCs serve nearly 60,000 individuals annually but face financial pressures due to Medicaid unwinding, workforce shortages, and rising costs. The state is exploring new models like Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics (CCBHCs) to integrate physical and mental health care.
- **Rapid Response Services**: Expanded rapid response services provide immediate mental health support, reducing reliance on emergency rooms.
- **Data and Accountability**: The state is developing a new data system, Granite Families, to replace outdated systems and improve accountability.
- **Funding and Sustainability**: CMHCs are struggling financially, and the state is working to find sustainable solutions. Quarterly monitoring of their financial health is underway.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the state’s commitment to improving mental health and child welfare services through community-based care, data-driven accountability, and sustainable funding models. Key challenges include workforce shortages, financial pressures on CMHCs, and the need for preventative measures to reduce long-term costs. Future discussions will focus on public health, developmental services, elderly care, and workforce issues, with a continued emphasis on aligning incentives to prioritize wellness and reduce reliance on high-cost services.
