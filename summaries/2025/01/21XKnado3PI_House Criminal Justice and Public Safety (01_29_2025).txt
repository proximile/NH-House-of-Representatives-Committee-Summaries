### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Criminal Justice and Public Safety (January 29, 2025)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on January 29, 2025, to address a range of issues related to criminal justice, public safety, and environmental protection. The meeting focused on several key legislative proposals, with discussions highlighting the need to balance enforcement with concerns about unintended consequences, particularly in areas such as child protection, traffic safety, bail reform, and sex trafficking. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics and discussions:

---

### **1. Child Protection and Neglect**
- **Systemic Gaps**: The meeting addressed significant gaps in the child protection system, with discussions highlighting horrific cases of child neglect and abuse. Proposals like **HB 553** and **SP23** aimed to enhance definitions of neglect and child endangerment. Concerns were raised about the potential for new criminal laws to complicate family reunification and service provision.
- **HB 257 (Charlotteâ€™s Law)**: This bill sought to establish the crime of **criminal neglect of a child**, defining it as failing to provide necessary care, food, clothing, medical care, shelter, or protection from controlled substances, resulting in serious endangerment. Penalties ranged from **Class A misdemeanors** to **Class A felonies** depending on the severity of harm. Debate centered on the necessity of felony classifications and the challenges of proving intent. Amendments were proposed to change the mental state required for prosecution from "purposely" to "knowingly" to make it easier to prosecute neglect cases.
- **Role of DCF vs. Criminal Justice**: County attorneys and law enforcement emphasized the need for criminal statutes to address neglect, as civil avenues through the Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCF) are often slow and inadequate.

### **2. Traffic Safety and Speeding Enforcement**
- **HB 500**: Representative Steve Pearson introduced this bill to create **enhanced enforcement zones** for speeding on highways, with increased penalties to reduce fatalities. Fines from speeding tickets would fund state police enforcement efforts. Concerns were raised about the effectiveness of fines as deterrents, especially for uninsured drivers.
- **HB 245**: Representative Keith Adman proposed creating a **Speed Awareness Fund**, supported by a portion of ticket fees, to help municipalities purchase speed enforcement equipment (e.g., radar guns, signs). Grants would be distributed based on need, with safeguards to prevent perverse incentives for writing more tickets.
- **Technology and Deterrence**: Discussions included the use of technology (e.g., speed cameras, toll sensors) for enforcement and the effectiveness of fines, insurance increases, and license loss as deterrents. The State Police emphasized education and data-driven strategies to reduce speeding and crashes.

### **3. Bail Reform and Magistrate Roles**
- **HB 592**: This bill aimed to address the "revolving door" of repeat offenders released on personal recognizance (PR) bail. Proposed changes included giving judges more discretion to detain individuals who violate bail conditions, fail to appear in court, or are arrested while already on bail. The bill eliminated automatic PR bail for certain high-risk offenders, requiring them to prove they qualify for release.
- **Support and Concerns**: 
  - **Support**: The governor, law enforcement, and judicial representatives supported the bill, citing frustrations with repeat offenders committing violent crimes while out on bail.
  - **Opposition**: The ACLU and defense lawyers argued that the bill risks returning to a wealth-based incarceration system, where those who cannot afford bail are detained pre-trial. They highlighted the success of the 2018 reforms in reducing unnecessary pre-trial detention.
- **Data and Evidence**: Data from Manchester showed that 24% of individuals arrested in 2024 were out on bail at the time of their arrest, underscoring the issue of repeat offenders. Studies indicated that pre-trial detention increases recidivism rates and disrupts families and employment.
- **Next Steps**: A subcommittee was formed to refine the bill, addressing logistical and policy concerns.

### **4. Environmental and Public Safety Issues**
- **Fireworks Regulation (HB 911)**: This bill aimed to simplify the process for fireworks displays by removing the requirement for fire department presence from the moment fireworks arrive until they are set off, allowing fire departments to use their discretion. It was seen as a cost-saving measure and received support from fire departments.
- **EMS Reporting (HB 183)**: The bill proposed removing the unfunded mandate requiring EMS to report within 24 hours of a call. Discussions focused on balancing timely reporting with the financial burden on EMS services, with suggestions to ensure critical calls are still reported promptly.
- **Cyanobacteria and Fertilizer Use (HB 416)**: This bill sought to regulate the disposal of yard waste into water bodies to address cyanobacteria plumes. Concerns about enforcement and effectiveness led the committee to retain the bill for further study.
- **Environmental Penalties (HB 291)**: An amendment proposed reducing penalties for incorrect fertilizer application, focusing on education rather than punishment. The amendment passed, with warnings for first offenses, fines for second offenses, and misdemeanor charges for subsequent violations.

### **5. Sex Trafficking and Illicit Massage Parlors**
- **HB 405**: This bill addressed sex trafficking in New Hampshire by imposing stricter penalties on landlords and businesses that knowingly harbor or facilitate sex trafficking operations. Proposed measures included making it a **Class B felony** for landlords or business operators who knowingly allow sex trafficking and creating a statewide database for massage therapy licensure.
- **Challenges and Solutions**: Law enforcement highlighted difficulties in prosecuting these cases due to language barriers, lack of cooperation, and low-level offenses. Suggestions included empowering local health departments or the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC) to conduct unannounced inspections and coordinating with Homeland Security to address the international nature of trafficking.
- **Legislative Action**: The committee emphasized the need for immediate legislative action rather than further study, with a focus on stronger penalties to deter trafficking.

### **6. Alternative Home Confinement and Recidivism**
- **HB 57**: Requested by the Department of Corrections, this bill aimed to expand the parameters of alternative home confinement to include post-secondary education opportunities. The goal was to reduce recidivism by allowing individuals to take courses that could help them transition back into society. The bill passed unanimously.

### **Key Themes and Observations**
- **Balancing Enforcement and Unintended Consequences**: Discussions consistently highlighted the need to balance enforcement with concerns about unintended consequences, such as wealth-based incarceration, perverse incentives for writing tickets, and disruptions to families and employment.
- **Collaboration and Data-Driven Approaches**: There was a strong emphasis on collaboration between stakeholders (e.g., law enforcement, judicial representatives, advocacy groups) and the use of data to inform legislative decisions.
- **Immediate Action vs. Further Study**: While some bills were retained for further study (e.g., HB 416), there was a clear preference for immediate legislative action in areas like child protection and sex trafficking.

### **Next Steps**
The committee planned to craft legislation based on the discussions and reconvene in a few weeks to finalize proposals for submission to the full committee. Emphasis was placed on creating actionable laws that address immediate needs while balancing enforcement with concerns about unintended consequences.
