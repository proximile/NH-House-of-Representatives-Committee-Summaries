On January 23, 2025, the New Hampshire House Committee on Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs convened to discuss several legislative proposals aimed at addressing critical healthcare and public safety issues. The meeting began with the Pledge of Allegiance and featured in-depth discussions on key bills, including measures related to emergency epinephrine administration, testosterone prescriptions, telehealth services, long COVID, and behavioral crisis services for individuals with intellectual disabilities.

### Key Bills and Discussions:

1. **Epinephrine Nasal Spray (House Bill 63)**:
   - **Purpose**: Allows schools and camps to use an FDA-approved epinephrine nasal spray (Nephy) for emergency treatment of anaphylactic reactions.
   - **Discussion**: The nasal spray, provided at no cost to the state, is easier to administer than traditional auto-injectors and has a longer shelf life. Kristen Evans, a parent, testified in support, sharing her son Truman’s experience with life-threatening allergies and emphasizing the importance of accessible emergency treatment. Truman also spoke about the challenges of living with severe allergies and the need for tools like the nasal spray to empower caregivers.
   - **Action**: The committee unanimously passed the bill with an amendment allowing schools and camps to maintain a supply of epinephrine without a specific prescription.

   - **Discussion**: Representative Dan Maguire explained that this bill builds on previous legislation allowing 90-day supplies for testosterone gel. The 12-month requirement is intended to ensure regular monitoring and prevent abuse. Concerns were raised about tracking prescriptions in retail pharmacies, but the bill received broad support.
   - **Action**: The bill was advanced with strong committee support.

3. **Telehealth Services (House Bill 72)**:
   - **Purpose**: Extends the commission to study telehealth services, focusing on post-pandemic trends, federal policies, and potential legislative recommendations.

Concerns were raised about funding sustainability and the rapid integration of AI in telehealth.

4. **Long COVID (House Bill 58)**:
   - **Purpose**: Establishes a committee to study legislative protections and accommodations for individuals with long COVID.
   - **Discussion**: Representative Wendy Thomas emphasized the economic and public health impacts of long COVID, which affects a significant portion of the workforce. The committee would explore ways to mitigate economic losses, reduce disparities, and improve access to healthcare and disability benefits. Questions were raised about the study’s scope and potential overlap with other chronic diseases.
   - **Action**: The bill was discussed, with attention to its potential to address the long-term effects of COVID-19.

5. **Behavioral Crisis Services (House Bill 370)**:
   - **Purpose**: Reestablishes a commission to study the delivery of behavioral crisis services to individuals with mental illness primarily due to intellectual disabilities.
   - **Discussion**: Representative Mark mlan, standing in for the prime sponsor, explained that the original commission was ineffective due to delayed appointments.
