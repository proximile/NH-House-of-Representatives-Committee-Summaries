The New Hampshire House of Representatives Municipal and County Government Committee meeting on January 30, 2025, addressed a range of bills and issues, with a particular focus on **recovery housing**, **agricultural practices**, **voter participation**, and **local governance**. Here’s a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and decisions:

---

### **Recovery Housing (House Bill 432)**
The meeting extensively discussed **House Bill 432**, which aims to clarify zoning and regulation of **recovery houses** (sober living facilities). Key points include:

1. **Purpose**: The bill seeks to treat recovery houses as residential facilities under state law, streamlining zoning processes to address the lack of recovery housing, particularly in rural areas. It aims to support individuals in recovery by providing safe, substance-free environments and reducing barriers to development.
2. **Support**: Advocates and individuals in recovery emphasized the life-saving impact of these facilities, noting their role in reducing relapse rates and promoting long-term sobriety. Testimonies highlighted the economic benefits, such as reduced incarceration costs and increased workforce participation.
3. **Certification**: Recovery houses must be certified within one year, adhering to national standards. The bill does not protect uncertified homes, addressing concerns about "bad actors" in the industry.
4. **Concerns**: Some residents and officials raised issues about poorly managed facilities, citing safety concerns and increased police activity. Questions were also raised about the certification process and potential loopholes.
5. **Legal Alignment**: The bill aligns with federal protections under the Fair Housing Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act, ensuring equitable housing access for individuals in recovery.

### **Agricultural Practices (House Bill 272)**
The committee discussed **House Bill 272**, which exempts certain agricultural practices from municipal noise regulations:

1. **Purpose**: The bill removes "quiet hours" from statutes to support farmers and forestry workers in conducting necessary activities at any time, particularly during weather-sensitive periods.
2. **Support**: Representatives and organizations like the NH Timberland Owners Association and NH Farm Bureau supported the bill, emphasizing the need for flexibility in agricultural operations.
3. **Concerns**: Questions were raised about the applicability of the exemption to specific activities, such as log trucks, and its impact on existing noise ordinances.

### **Voter Participation and Local Governance**
Several bills addressed voter participation and local governance:

1. **House Bill 149**: This bill proposed allowing both original and amended versions of warrant articles to appear on the ballot, giving voters the final say. While proponents argued it would empower voters, opponents cited concerns about confusion, increased costs, and the complexity of implementation.
2. **House Bill 407**: This bill sets a minimum voter turnout threshold (15% of registered voters) for adopting town and school budgets, aiming to ensure broader community support and prevent special interest groups from dominating low-turnout elections.
3. **House Bill 173**: The committee tied 9-9 on whether to pass this bill, which aimed to maintain the purpose of petitioned warrant articles. A subsequent motion to retain the bill for further review passed 10-8.

### **Other Key Bills**
1. **House Bill 230**: This bill seeks to narrow the scope of municipal public health ordinances to focus on nuisances and sanitation, rather than broader issues like mask mandates. The discussion highlighted concerns about overreach and the lack of public hearings for such ordinances.
2. **House Bill 339**: This bill expands municipal master plans to include agricultural land preservation and the promotion of food production enterprises.
3. **House Bill 346**: The committee voted 10-8 in favor of increasing the maximum fee for racetracks from $100 to $500, with the decision left to local municipalities.
4. **House Bill 165**: The committee unanimously voted to increase the maximum disaster relief funding for municipalities from $25,000 to $100,000, citing outdated limits.
5. **House Bill 447**: This bill aims to expand property tax exemptions for disabled veterans whose homes have been modified through VA programs or made ADA-compliant. While proponents emphasized the need for tax relief, concerns were raised about the bill’s language potentially broadening eligibility too far.
6. **House Bill 453**: This bill, which sought to prohibit municipalities from banning gas-powered ground maintenance equipment, initially failed with a 9-9 vote but was retained for further discussion after a 12-6 vote.
7. **House Bill 488**: This bill, addressing conflicts of interest for municipal board members, was retained unanimously (18-0) for further refinement.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
1. **Recovery Housing**: The committee recognized the critical need for recovery housing but grappled with balancing support for development with concerns about oversight and community impact.
2. **Agricultural Flexibility**: Bills like HB 272 aimed to provide farmers and forestry workers with the flexibility needed to operate outside standard hours.
3. **Voter Empowerment vs. Complexity**: Efforts to increase voter participation, such as HB 149 and HB 407, sparked debates about balancing voter empowerment with the potential for confusion and increased costs.
4. **Local Control**: Many discussions centered on the balance between local control and state oversight, particularly in areas like public health ordinances, agricultural practices, and municipal governance.
