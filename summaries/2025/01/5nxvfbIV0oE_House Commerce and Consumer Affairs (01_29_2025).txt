**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee Meeting (01/29/2025)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee convened on January 29, 2025, to discuss a range of topics, including cryptocurrency and blockchain legislation, insurance law amendments, healthcare and insurance coverage, and administrative updates. The meeting highlighted the need for clear regulations, consumer protection, and proactive measures to address emerging technologies and healthcare advancements.

### **Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Legislation**

1. **Legislative Framework and Consumer Protection**:
   - Representatives debated the lack of a legislative framework for cryptocurrency and blockchain technology in New Hampshire. Concerns were raised about energy consumption, noise pollution from mining operations, and the distinction between smart contracts and legal contracts.
   - The concept of "staking" in blockchain was explained, where digital assets are locked to operate the consensus mechanism, with rewards and penalties for accurate or dishonest participation.
   - A proposal for a blockchain dispute docket was discussed, modeled after the existing business dispute docket. Concerns about costs and workload were addressed by clarifying that the docket would initially be handled by existing judges without significant additional expense.

2. **Energy and Environmental Concerns**:
   - The bill includes provisions to encourage the use of more energy-efficient proof-of-stake validation over proof-of-work in blockchain operations.
   - Discussions emphasized the environmental impact of blockchain technology and the potential for state incentives to promote greener practices.

### **Insurance Law Amendments**

1. **House Bill 499**:
   - The bill makes technical corrections to certain insurance laws, including a notification requirement for insurance companies withdrawing from the market or changing their offerings.
   - The financial threshold for new insurance companies was increased to $3 million to filter out non-serious proposals and reduce administrative burden.
   - Several fees were eliminated to streamline the licensing process and reduce unnecessary administrative costs.

### **Healthcare and Insurance Coverage**

1. **House Bill 552**:
   - Proposed by Representative James Nome, the bill seeks to remove the requirement that children aged 19-25 must be full-time students to qualify for coverage under the state retiree insurance plan.
   - This change aligns the retiree plan with current state employee plans and ACA standards and will not cost New Hampshire taxpayers, as premiums will be paid by retirees.

2. **House Bill 648**:
   - Proposed by Representative Hope Damon Sullivan, the bill aims to require commercial insurance coverage for glucose monitoring devices and supplies for people with diabetes, particularly for those with type 2 or gestational diabetes.
   - Testimonies highlighted the life-saving benefits of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices, including improved patient outcomes and reduced hospitalizations.
   - Concerns were raised about potential insurance cost increases, with discussions on the possibility of amending the bill to include deductible requirements.

### **Administrative Updates and Scheduling**

1. **House Bill 499 (Liquor Commission)**:
   - The bill proposes organizational changes within the New Hampshire Liquor Commission, including splitting the division of administration into separate divisions of administration and finance.
   - Clarifications were made on the distinction between unclassified and classified positions within the Liquor Commission.

2. **Ambulance Bills**:
   - The committee discussed scheduling hearings for ambulance-related bills, including one proposed by fire chiefs that involves a 230% over Medicaid rate.
   - Subcommittee meetings were planned for February 12 to address early bills, with the aim of executing all necessary bills by February 19.

### **Other Discussions**

1. **Blockchain Technology Bill**:
   - Representative Keith Ammon introduced a bill to establish a legal framework for blockchain technology, including provisions to protect individuals' rights to hold and use digital assets and create a blockchain dispute docket.
   - Concerns were raised about the potential impact of large-scale blockchain operations on the state's electrical grid and water supply.

2. **Retention of Bills**:
   - Some bills, including one related to consumer protection and dietary supplements, were retained for further review and potential amendments.

Overall, the meeting underscored the importance of balancing innovation and healthcare advancements with concerns about costs, regulatory impact, and environmental considerations. The committee committed to addressing these issues through clear regulations, proactive measures, and ongoing discussions.
