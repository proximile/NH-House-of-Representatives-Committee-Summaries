### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **1. HB 572: Partners in Housing Program**
- **Purpose**: Address housing affordability and the "missing middle" housing gap by supporting the development of modestly priced homes for working families.
- **Mechanisms**: 
  - Creation of a database of municipal and county-owned land suitable for development.
  - Low-interest loans or grants for developers collaborating with municipalities.
  - Expedited planning board reviews to reduce costs and delays.

#### **2. HB 604: Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs)**
- **Purpose**: Incentivize the creation of ADUs (e.g., garage apartments, in-law suites) to provide affordable housing options.
- **Program Details**: Forgivable loans for lower-income homeowners to build ADUs, with rent caps set at 30% of area median income.
- **Support**: Proponents, including New Hampshire Housing, highlighted the flexibility and affordability of ADUs, especially in rural and urban areas.
- **Concerns**: Fiscal sustainability, forgiveness terms, and rental rate adjustments based on tenant income changes were discussed.

#### **3. HB 382: Parking Minimums**
- **Purpose**: Eliminate statewide parking minimums to encourage housing and commercial development.
- **Support**: Advocates argued that reducing parking requirements would free up land for housing, reduce costs, and promote sustainable growth.
- **Opposition**: The New Hampshire Municipal Association emphasized the importance of local control over parking regulations, citing concerns about congestion and neighborhood disputes.

- **Support**: Proponents argued that the registry would provide critical data to study rental affordability and prevent exploitation.

- **Outcome**: The committee moved to kill the bill, with a minority report recommending further work.

#### **5. HB 623: Corporate Ownership of Single-Family Homes**
- **Purpose**: Regulate the purchase of single-family homes by corporations and non-natural entities, including a 90-day waiting period for corporate buyers.
- **Support**: Advocates highlighted the difficulty individuals face in competing with corporate cash offers, which drive up prices and reduce affordability.
- **Opposition**: Concerns were raised about the bill’s constitutionality, potential economic impact, and unintended consequences, such as reduced rental housing availability.
- **Outcome**: The committee voted to kill the bill (**10-8**), with a minority report suggesting further refinement.

### **Key Themes**

1. **Housing Crisis**: New Hampshire faces a severe housing shortage, with estimates suggesting a need for 20,000–60,000 new units by 2030. High construction costs, restrictive zoning, and corporate ownership of single-family homes were identified as key contributors.

2. **Affordability**: Many bills focused on creating affordable housing options for working families, low-income residents, and vulnerable populations, such as voucher holders and people with disabilities.

3. **Public-Private Partnerships**: Several proposals emphasized collaboration between state, local governments, and private developers to reduce costs and streamline processes.

4. **Local vs. State Control**: Debates centered on the balance between state-level reforms (e.g., eliminating parking minimums) and local control over zoning, parking, and land use.

5. **Tenant Protections vs. Landlord Rights**: Discussions highlighted the tension between protecting tenants (e.g., through rent registries and anti-discrimination measures) and addressing landlords’ concerns about administrative burdens and property rights.

6. **Sustainability and Fiscal Responsibility**: Concerns were raised about the financial sustainability of proposed programs, with suggestions for revolving loan funds, flexible funding mechanisms, and further study.

While there was broad support for increasing housing supply and affordability, significant disagreements emerged over the best approaches, particularly regarding local control, fiscal sustainability, and the balance between tenant protections and landlord rights.

The discussions highlighted the need for innovative, collaborative solutions to ensure equitable access to housing for all residents.
