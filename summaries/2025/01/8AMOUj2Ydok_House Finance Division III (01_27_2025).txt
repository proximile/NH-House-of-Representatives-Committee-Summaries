**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Finance Division III Meeting (01/27/2025)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division III convened on January 27, 2025, for an in-depth discussion on the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and its role in addressing public health, Medicaid, and state services. The meeting, divided into two segments, focused on DHHS’s operational priorities, strategic goals, and efforts to improve service delivery, accountability, and efficiency. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points from both segments:

---

### **Public Health and Medicaid Focus**
1. **Public Contract Accessibility**: Representatives emphasized the need to make state contracts more accessible to encourage public participation and competitive bidding.
2. **Environmental and Public Health Initiatives**: DHHS highlighted its focus on addressing environmental threats such as lead in homes and water, ensuring food safety, and supporting local health officers. Efforts to integrate services aim to streamline care for families and individuals.
3. **Specialized Services**: The department is working to create a more coordinated system for youth, older adults, and individuals with mental health needs, reducing confusion and improving efficiency.
4. **Mission Zero Initiative**: A key priority is reducing emergency department boarding for individuals with acute mental health needs by leveraging multiple funding streams.
5. **Medicaid Program**: Medicaid was discussed as a critical lifeline for vulnerable populations, including children, low-income families, individuals with disabilities, and the elderly. The program covers a wide range of services, including dental benefits, and emphasizes accountability and efficient use of taxpayer funds.

### **DHHS Overview and Strategic Goals**
1. **Department Mission and Vision**: Commissioner Lori Weaver underscored DHHS’s commitment to transparency, honesty, and professionalism, particularly during a challenging budget cycle. The department’s mission focuses on protection, prevention, client service delivery, and regulatory oversight.
2. **Budget and Workforce**: DHHS manages a $3.6 billion budget, representing 53% of the state’s general funds. With a quarter of the state’s workforce, the department has reduced its vacancy rate from 22% to 14% over two years but faces challenges due to a hiring freeze. About 50% of the workforce is in direct care roles.
3. **Budget Complexity**: CFO Nathan White explained the intricacies of DHHS’s budget, including federal funding, cost allocation, and maintenance of effort requirements (e.g., TANF funding). Balancing budget assumptions with actual spending remains a priority.
4. **Strategic Roadmap**: DHHS’s strategic roadmap emphasizes promoting thriving communities, efficient stewardship of resources, and strong customer service. Key initiatives include improving access to behavioral health services, enhancing community-based care, and continuing the Mission Zero initiative.
5. **Technology and Efficiency**: Chief Operating Officer David Weers highlighted the department’s focus on technology and automation, reducing the number of applications from 200 to 130 to improve efficiency. Key platforms include Medicaid Enterprise Systems and Salesforce.
6. **Contract Management**: The centralized contracts unit manages over 700 contracts annually, ensuring enforceability and meaningful performance measures. Lean Six Sigma principles are applied to enhance processes and customer satisfaction.
7. **Quality and Performance**: DHHS conducts risk assessments, audits providers, and monitors financial integrity to ensure funds are used effectively. A dedicated fraud, waste, and abuse team investigates suspicious activities.

### **Future Discussions and Committee Requests**
1. **Upcoming Topics**: The committee plans to delve deeper into specific areas in future sessions, including the system of care for healthy aging, preventive programs for older adults, and the state’s developmental services system.
2. **Clarifications and Data Requests**: Committee members sought detailed information on staffing numbers, Medicaid eligibility, and the coordination of long-term care services. DHHS committed to providing comprehensive data in subsequent presentations.
3. **Strategic Roadmap Alignment**: The committee requested a deeper analysis of how DHHS’s strategic roadmap aligns with budget resources, including financial and personnel allocations.

### **Key Themes**
