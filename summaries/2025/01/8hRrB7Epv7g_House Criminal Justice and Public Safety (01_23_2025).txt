**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on Criminal Justice and Public Safety (January 23, 2025)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee convened on January 23, 2025, to discuss several bills related to cannabis legalization, medical cannabis access, drug checking, and harm reduction. The meeting highlighted a range of legislative efforts aimed at addressing public health, criminal justice reform, and the evolving legal landscape surrounding cannabis and substance use. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and bills addressed during the meeting:

---

### **Cannabis Legalization and Medical Access**

1. **House Bill 75**: This bill proposes to legalize cannabis for individuals aged 21 and older by removing it from the state’s Controlled Drug Act. The sponsor emphasized that the bill is focused solely on legalization and does not address recreational use or sales. The hearing was brief, with no testimony for or against the bill.

2. **House Bill 190**: This bill seeks to increase the therapeutic cannabis purchase and possession limit from 2 to 4 ounces for medical patients. Representative Heath Howard, the sponsor, argued that this change would reduce the burden on patients, particularly those in rural areas who face challenges accessing dispensaries. The bill would allow patients to buy in bulk, create their own products (e.g., edibles, oils), and save money, as therapeutic cannabis is not covered by insurance. Supporters highlighted the importance of regulated cannabis over black-market products, while opponents raised concerns about diversion and the need to extend the purchase time frame to align with the increased limit.

3. **House Bill 380**: This bill aims to remove an **enhanced penalty** for the sale of cannabis by registered patients or caregivers to unauthorized individuals under the state’s therapeutic cannabis program. Currently, such individuals face an additional class B felony, which doubles the penalties. Testifiers argued that the enhanced penalty is redundant, disproportionately impacts vulnerable patients, and is outdated given the availability of legal recreational cannabis in neighboring states. Supporters emphasized that the bill would ensure fairness and align penalties with the current legal landscape.

4. **House Bill 196**: This bill focuses on allowing the Department of Safety to annul misdemeanor and violation-level cannabis possession charges over an 18-month period. Supporters highlighted the barriers individuals face in employment, housing, and education due to past cannabis convictions. The bill aims to provide a more accessible annulment process, helping individuals reintegrate into society. Testimonies included personal stories of the economic and legal challenges caused by cannabis convictions.

5. **House Bill 198**: This bill proposes to legalize the possession of up to 2 ounces of cannabis for adults aged 21 and older, while prohibiting public smoking or vaping and driving under the influence. Supporters argued that cannabis possession arrests are unnecessary and ruin lives, especially given the legalization in surrounding states. Opponents, including the NH Association of Chiefs of Police, raised concerns about sweeping annulments for misdemeanors and violations, advocating for a more intentional, case-by-case approach.

### **Drug Checking and Harm Reduction**

1. **House Bill 226**: This bill legalizes the use of advanced drug-checking equipment by harm reduction organizations to analyze substances for dangerous additives like fentanyl and xylazine. It builds on previous legislation that decriminalized fentanyl and xylazine test strips. Supporters emphasized that drug checking is a critical tool for preventing overdoses, connecting individuals to treatment, and addressing the evolving illicit drug market. A proposed amendment clarified that only authorized organizations can use the equipment, addressing concerns about broad language and ensuring accountability.

2. **General Harm Reduction Discussion**: Throughout the meeting, advocates highlighted the importance of harm reduction programs in engaging with at-risk populations, including college students and those in active addiction. They argued that harm reduction measures, such as drug checking and decriminalization, save lives and provide pathways to recovery. Law enforcement representatives expressed concerns about the potential for exploitation and the need for clarity in legislation, but advocates emphasized the public health benefits of these initiatives.

### **Key Themes and Takeaways**

1. **Accessibility and Affordability**: Many discussions centered on the challenges faced by medical cannabis patients, particularly those in rural areas, in accessing dispensaries and affording therapeutic cannabis. Increasing possession limits and reducing penalties were seen as ways to alleviate these burdens.

2. **Harm Reduction and Public Health**: The meeting underscored the importance of harm reduction strategies, such as drug checking and decriminalization, in addressing the opioid crisis and reducing overdose deaths. Advocates emphasized that these measures save lives and provide opportunities for treatment and recovery.

3. **Criminal Justice Reform**: Several bills focused on reducing the criminalization of cannabis possession and addressing the collateral consequences of past convictions. Supporters argued that these reforms are necessary to reduce stigma, promote rehabilitation, and help individuals reintegrate into society.

4. **Balancing Law Enforcement and Public Health**: Discussions highlighted the need to balance public health goals with law enforcement concerns, particularly regarding drug checking and cannabis legalization. Amendments and clarifications were proposed to address these concerns while advancing harm reduction and criminal justice reform.
