### **Committee Introductions and Orientation**
The meeting began with introductions from committee members, who shared their diverse professional backgrounds and interests in energy, technology, and public service. Key members included:
- **Representative Kaplan**, a public school teacher with energy committee experience.
- **Representative Matson**, a former plumber and industrial mechanic.
- **Representative LaRelle**, a chemist with a background at DuPont.

Committee Chair Michael Vose outlined procedures for public hearings, executive sessions, and committee conduct. Members were reminded of the importance of decorum, attendance, and the use of shared resources like a Google Sheet for tracking bills and votes. Security protocols and emergency procedures were also discussed.

### **Presentations and Key Discussions**

#### **New Hampshire Department of Energy (DOE) Overview**
Commissioner Jared Chakin and Deputy Commissioner Chris Elms provided an overview of the DOE’s mission, structure, and responsibilities, including policy development, consumer services, energy assistance programs, and regulatory oversight. Key points included:
- **Regional Collaboration**: The DOE works closely with ISO New England to ensure energy reliability, affordability, and market efficiency.
- **Clean Energy Transition**: New Hampshire faces challenges in aligning with neighboring states’ ambitious decarbonization goals while prioritizing cost-effectiveness and reliability.
- **Winter Reliability**: The state’s reliance on natural gas and oil for electricity generation during peak heating seasons underscores the need for long-term solutions to balance supply and demand.

#### **Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) and Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs)**
The committee discussed the RPS, which requires electricity providers to obtain RECs to meet renewable energy quotas. Key highlights included:
- **RPS Goals**: The RPS is set to plateau at 25.2% in 2025, with different REC classes for technologies like solar and biomass.
- **Economic Impact**: Adjustments to REC classes, such as reducing Class 3 RECs from 8% to 0.5%, were made to avoid excessive costs for ratepayers while supporting local industries like biomass and timber.
- **Regional REC Market**: RECs can be traded regionally, with states like Connecticut retiring RECs generated in New Hampshire.

#### **Energy Reliability and Infrastructure**
The committee emphasized the importance of maintaining energy reliability, particularly as New Hampshire transitions from a summer peaking to a winter peaking system. Key concerns included:
- **Transmission Costs**: Significant increases in transmission rates since 2004 were attributed to policies incentivizing large-scale infrastructure development.
- **Asset Maintenance**: Regulatory oversight is needed to ensure efficient spending on power line maintenance, especially in the North Country.

#### **Emerging Technologies**
The committee explored the potential of emerging technologies, including:
- **Small Modular Nuclear Reactors (SMRs)**: While SMRs hold promise for future energy needs, high capital costs and a lack of operational examples remain barriers.
- **Energy Storage**: Projects like the Form Energy battery in Maine were highlighted as critical for managing intraday energy shifts and prolonged cold snaps.

---

### **Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Role**
The PUC’s role in setting just and reasonable utility rates, overseeing energy-related matters, and fostering retail competition was outlined. Key points included:
- **Default Service**: The PUC is encouraging utilities to self-procure energy directly from the wholesale market to reduce costs for residential customers.
- **Consumer Protections**: The PUC can impose penalties for overcharging and ensures ethical conduct among commissioners.
- **Regional Coordination**: The PUC represents New Hampshire’s interests in ISO New England, addressing challenges like gas-electric coordination during extreme weather.

---

### **Procedural and Policy Discussions**
The committee reviewed procedural details for public hearings, executive sessions, and committee operations, including:
- **Motions and Amendments**: Members discussed the process for proposing and voting on amendments, with a focus on clarity and efficiency.
- **Conflict of Interest**: New legislation requires members to recuse themselves from voting on bills where they have a conflict of interest, though they can still ask questions.
- **Committee Reports**: Reports must be clear, concise, and fact-based, summarizing legislation and the committee’s reasoning.

---

### **Future Focus and Next Steps**
The meeting concluded with a focus on the committee’s priorities for the legislative session, including:
- **Energy Strategy**: The DOE is revising the state’s energy strategy, emphasizing cost-effective, market-driven approaches to meet energy goals.
- **Public Hearings**: Upcoming hearings will address bills related to renewable energy, energy efficiency, and environmental sustainability.
- **Collaboration**: The committee emphasized the need for collaboration with regional stakeholders to address challenges like energy reliability, affordability, and the transition to cleaner energy sources.

---

### **Key Themes**
1. **Reliability and Affordability**: Ensuring a reliable and cost-effective energy supply remains a top priority, particularly during peak demand periods.
2. **Renewable Energy Transition**: The committee is committed to advancing renewable energy while balancing economic and environmental considerations.
3. **Emerging Technologies**: SMRs, energy storage, and other innovations are seen as critical to New Hampshire’s energy future.
4. **Regulatory Oversight**: The PUC and DOE play vital roles in setting rates, ensuring consumer protections, and fostering market efficiency.

The meeting set the stage for a productive legislative session focused on addressing New Hampshire’s energy challenges and opportunities.
