### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee Meeting (January 21, 2025)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee convened on January 21, 2025, to discuss several key bills addressing environmental, agricultural, and animal welfare issues. The meeting focused on landfill permitting, animal cruelty investigations, rabies vaccination requirements, dog licensing penalties, and the declawing of cats. Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions and key points from each segment:

---

### **1. Landfill Permitting (HB 215 and HB 2115)**
The committee extensively debated bills aimed at modernizing the landfill permitting process and ensuring transparency in evaluating the public benefits and harms of landfill projects.

- **HB 215** requires landfill permit applicants to conduct a **cost-benefit analysis**, assessing potential harms (e.g., pollution, health risks, property value declines) and benefits (e.g., job creation, waste capacity). The analysis would be conducted by an independent third party and made part of the public record. Proponents argued that this would provide host communities with critical information to make informed decisions, especially as they often lack resources to investigate long-term impacts. Critics, including the **Department of Environmental Services (DES)**, raised concerns about the bill potentially constraining permitting processes and the need for impartial evaluations.
  
- **HB 2115** expands on this by requiring a **net public benefit analysis** for both new landfills and expansions of existing facilities. Discussions highlighted concerns about increased traffic, odor, and environmental degradation from expansions. Representatives also debated whether existing landfills, such as the TurnKey landfill in Rochester, should undergo updated evaluations given their long operational histories. The bill received strong public support, with 69 individuals registering in favor and only 4 in opposition.

Key themes included the need for **transparency**, **community protection**, and **responsible waste management**. Suggestions for amendments included clarifying the role of third-party consultants and ensuring that recycling center proposals are not used to "sweeten" landfill permits.

### **2. Animal Cruelty Investigations (HB 153)**
The committee discussed **HB 153**, which mandates specialized training for law enforcement officers to handle animal cruelty cases, particularly in rural areas lacking Animal Control Officers (ACOs).

- The bill requires **20 officers statewide** (two per county and 10 state police officers) to complete an 8-hour training course on animal cruelty laws, with a 2-hour refresher every three years. The goal is to improve due process and ensure officers are equipped to investigate cases involving livestock and other animals.
  
- **Supporters**, including Representative Barbara Comtois, argued that training is essential to prevent mishandling of cases due to lack of knowledge. Farmers and animal welfare advocates emphasized the need for better training to assess cruelty cases, especially those involving livestock.
  
- **Opponents**, such as Sheriff Bill Wright of the NH Sheriff’s Association, raised concerns about **unfunded mandates** and ambiguity in the bill’s language. They argued that sheriffs and state police could be overburdened if required to assume primary investigative roles.

Proposed solutions included creating a **statewide task force** for animal cruelty investigations, expanding training for all law enforcement officers, and clarifying that assistance is provided "as staffing allows."

### **3. Rabies Vaccination for Dogs (HB 240)**
The committee reviewed **HB 240**, which proposes removing the penalty of **dog forfeiture** for non-payment of dog license fees while retaining financial penalties and court involvement.

- The bill’s sponsor shared a constituent’s story of an elderly dog threatened with seizure over a $25 late fee, highlighting the need for more compassionate enforcement. Testimony from a town clerk revealed that many towns use forfeiture as a **scare tactic** rather than enforcing it, emphasizing the importance of rabies vaccination.
  
- **Opponents**, including veterinarians and animal welfare organizations, argued that removing penalties could reduce compliance with rabies vaccination laws, posing significant public health risks. They stressed that exemptions exist for dogs with health issues and that penalties are necessary to enforce vaccination requirements.

### **4. Declawing of Cats (HB 21)**
The committee debated **HB 21**, which seeks to ban the declawing of cats in New Hampshire.

- **Supporters** described declawing as inhumane, likening it to amputating a cat’s fingers at the first knuckle. They cited data showing that declawing leads to chronic pain, behavioral issues, and reduced quality of life. Alternatives such as nail trimming, nail caps, and scratching posts were emphasized as humane solutions. Supporters also noted that 42 countries and several U.S. states have already banned declawing.
  
- **Opponents**, including the New Hampshire Veterinary Medical Association (NHVMA), argued that the bill undermines veterinarians’ professional judgment and autonomy. They noted that declawing is rarely performed and should remain an option for medically necessary cases. Concerns were raised about the bill setting a precedent for legislative interference in veterinary practices.

Proposals included conducting a comprehensive survey of New Hampshire veterinarians to determine the current prevalence of declawing before legislating.

### **5. Dog Licensing Penalties (HB 240)**
The committee revisited **HB 240**, focusing on the removal of forfeiture penalties for non-payment of dog license fees.

- The sponsor highlighted the disproportionate impact of forfeiture on low-income pet owners and shared personal stories of dogs at risk of seizure due to minor late fees. Testimonies from town clerks revealed that many towns do not enforce forfeiture but use it as a deterrent.
  
- **Concerns** were raised about public health risks if penalties were removed entirely, with some committee members suggesting amendments to provide **exceptions** for extenuating circumstances.

### **Key Outcomes and Next Steps**
The meeting concluded with a call for amendments to refine the bills’ language and address concerns raised by stakeholders. Key areas for further discussion included:
- **Clarifying roles and responsibilities** in animal cruelty investigations (HB 153).
- **Balancing public health and compassion** in dog licensing penalties (HB 240).
- **Ensuring transparency and community protection** in landfill permitting (HB 215 and HB 2115).
- **Balancing animal welfare and veterinary autonomy** in the declawing ban (HB 21).

The committee scheduled additional work sessions to refine the bills before moving them forward, emphasizing the need for clear, well-defined legislation that balances public benefit, environmental protection, and operational practicality.
