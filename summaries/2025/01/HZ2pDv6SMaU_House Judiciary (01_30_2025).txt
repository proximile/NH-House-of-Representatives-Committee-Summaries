**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Judiciary Committee Meeting (01/30/2025)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Judiciary Committee convened on January 30, 2025, to discuss and vote on a range of bills and resolutions. The meeting addressed critical issues such as parental rights, library privacy, public records access, and judicial transparency, while also revisiting procedural matters and preparing for an upcoming heavy legislative workload. Here is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and actions:

---

### **1. Library Privacy and Parental Rights**
- **HB 273 (Parental Access to Library Records)**: The committee debated a bill allowing parents access to their minor child’s library borrowing records. Proponents argued that parents have a fundamental right to oversee their children’s activities, while opponents raised concerns about privacy, particularly in sensitive situations such as custody disputes or mental health issues. The bill ultimately passed, though some members highlighted potential unintended consequences.
- **HB 376 (Library Privacy Exemption)**: The committee discussed a bill to exempt library card and membership information from public disclosure under the Right-to-Know law. Supporters emphasized the importance of protecting privacy to encourage library use. The bill passed with broad support, with one dissenting vote.

### **2. Public Records Access and Fees**
- **HB 66 and HB 74 (Public Records Access)**: The committee revisited legislation addressing public records access. HB 66 proposed broadening access by replacing "citizen" with "person" and allowing remote record requests, while HB 74 sought to define "citizen of the state." An amendment to HB 66 was proposed to restrict remote requests to individuals with a New Hampshire connection or media members. The committee voted to pass HB 66 without the amendment and retain HB 74 for further study.
- **Municipal Fees for Public Records**: The committee debated the appropriateness of municipalities charging fees for public records requests exceeding 250 emails in a month. While some members argued fees are necessary to cover administrative costs, others stressed the importance of free access to public records. A compromise from the previous year was acknowledged, but further refinement was deemed necessary.

### **3. Sexual Assault Legislation and Competency Restoration**
- **HB 369 (Sexual Assault Misdemeanor Cases)**: Representative Kutab proposed an amendment to clarify that victims under 18 at the time of prosecution would be covered under the bill. The amendment was supported, though some members requested additional time to review the underlying bill before finalizing their vote.
- **HB 480 (Restoration of Competency for Criminal Defendants)**: The committee discussed a bill addressing the restoration of competency for criminal defendants to stand trial. Members requested more time to review the bill before proceeding.

---

### **4. Procedural Corrections and Revisited Votes**
- **HB 98 and HB 164**: Due to a procedural error, the committee revoted on these bills, both of which had previously passed unanimously. HB 98 relates to professional limited liability company assistant managers, while HB 164 addresses local records and includes an updated fiscal note amendment.
- **HR6 (Condemnation of Disparate Impact Doctrine)**: The committee discussed HR6, which condemns the judicial doctrine of disparate impact. Representative Manos moved to recommend "ITL" (Inexpedient to Legislate), arguing that the legislature cannot bind the judiciary on such decisions. The motion passed with a 15-2 vote.

### **5. Right-to-Know Ombudsman and Other Bills**
- **HB 11 (Right-to-Know Ombudsman Extension)**: The committee debated extending the position of the Right-to-Know Ombudsman for four years. An amendment was proposed to address concerns about legal threats and attorney fees in ombudsman cases. The amendment passed 16-1, and the bill was recommended for passage with a 15-2 vote.
- **HB 80 (Physical Presence for Voting)**: A bill requiring physical presence for voting in public meetings was discussed but ultimately voted down.
- **HB 265 (Meeting Minutes)**: A bill to include start/end times and the name of the minute-taker in official meeting minutes passed unanimously.
