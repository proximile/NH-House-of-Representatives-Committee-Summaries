The New Hampshire House Labor, Industrial, and Rehabilitative Services Committee convened on January 21, 2025, to address a range of labor-related issues and proposed legislation. The meeting included discussions on workers' compensation, unemployment insurance, employment protections, and emerging labor trends, as well as the introduction and debate of several key bills. Here is a cohesive summary of the key points and discussions from the meeting:

---

### **1. Committee Organization and Mission**
The meeting began with organizational matters, including introductions of committee members and staff. The committee’s mission is to address issues related to labor, wages, workers' compensation, unemployment insurance, collective bargaining, job retention, and rehabilitative services, balancing employee rights with the needs of the industrial sector. Procedures for meetings, subcommittees, and executive sessions were outlined, emphasizing respect for testimony and the role of staff in supporting committee work.

### **2. Labor Market Overview and Department of Labor’s Role**
The Department of Labor (DOL) provided an overview of its responsibilities, including wage and hour law enforcement, workers' compensation, public employee safety, and boiler and elevator certification. Key points included:
- **Workers' Compensation**: Employers must comply with safety requirements, including joint loss management committees and safety summary forms, with DOL inspectors ensuring compliance.
- **Unemployment Insurance**: The system is funded by employer taxes, with New Hampshire’s unemployment trust fund at $390 million—the healthiest in state history. Benefits include up to 26 weeks of unemployment, with a maximum weekly benefit of $427. The state’s unemployment rate is 2.2%, reflecting full employment.
- **Labor Market Trends**: Strong growth in professional, technical, and scientific industries is noted, though high demand persists in healthcare, particularly for nurses. Remote work and independent contractor trends are being monitored, though gig workers are not covered by traditional unemployment insurance.

### **3. Key Bills and Legislative Discussions**
Several bills were introduced and debated, with stakeholders providing testimony and raising concerns:

#### **House Bill 69 (HB 69): Mandatory Use of E-Verify**
- **Purpose**: Requires businesses to use the federal E-Verify system to confirm employment eligibility.
- **Support**: Proponents argue it ensures compliance with immigration laws and protects workers.
- **Opposition**: Critics, including the New Hampshire Immigrants’ Rights Network and the Business and Industry Association, cite concerns about error rates, regulatory burdens, and the redundancy of existing I-9 verification requirements.

#### **House Bill 353 (HB 353): Hearing Protection for Nightclub and Music Venue Employees**
- **Purpose**: Protects employees from sustained high-decibel noise exposure.
- **Support**: Advocates highlight the risks of hearing loss and the need for enhanced protections.
- **Opposition**: Stakeholders, including the New Hampshire Lodging and Restaurant Association, argue the bill is impractical and difficult to enforce, particularly in dynamic environments.

#### **House Bill 225 (HB 225): Employment Protections for Military Spouses**
- **Purpose**: Allows spouses of deployed military personnel to take a leave of absence and return to their jobs post-deployment.
- **Support**: Emphasizes the sacrifices of military families and the need for financial stability during deployments.
- **Concerns**: Questions were raised about the burden on small businesses, enforcement mechanisms, and alignment with federal standards.

### **4. Emerging Issues and Policy Discussions**
The committee explored several emerging labor issues and policy considerations:
- **Noise Exposure Regulations**: Administrative rule **14341**, which mirrors OSHA standards, sets acceptable noise exposure levels for public employers. Discussions centered on the potential impact of stricter regulations on workers' compensation claims and liability.
- **Private Unemployment Insurance**: Representative Granger proposed a study committee to explore private-sector unemployment insurance options. Concerns were raised about compliance with federal requirements and potential unintended consequences, such as incentivizing longer unemployment periods.
- **Military Spouse Employment Protections**: The committee discussed the importance of supporting military families while balancing the practical concerns of employers, particularly small businesses.

### **5. Conclusion and Next Steps**
The meeting concluded with a commitment to refine and improve the proposed bills, addressing stakeholder concerns and ensuring clarity and feasibility. The committee will consider amendments, conduct further studies, and explore administrative rule changes where appropriate. The discussions highlighted the committee’s focus on maintaining a robust and compliant labor market system while adapting to emerging trends and supporting vulnerable populations, such as military families and workers in high-risk industries.
