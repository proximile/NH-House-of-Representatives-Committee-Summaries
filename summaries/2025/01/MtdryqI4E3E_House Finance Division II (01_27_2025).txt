The NH House of Representatives' House Finance Division II meeting on January 27, 2025, focused on the state's investment in education and workforce development, with presentations from the New Hampshire University System (UNH) and the Community College System of New Hampshire. The discussions emphasized the critical role of these systems in addressing workforce needs, improving accessibility to education, and ensuring economic growth. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key points:

---

#### **State Investment in Education and Workforce Development**
1. **Early College and Dual Enrollment Programs**:
   - The state’s $2.5 million annual investment in early college and dual enrollment programs has yielded significant returns, saving residents $13 million in tuition and fees.
   - These programs enable high school students to earn college credits, associate degrees, or complete a year of college, reducing student debt and accelerating entry into the workforce.
   - Program growth has been steady, with a 15% year-over-year increase in credits earned, totaling approximately 60,000 credits annually.

2. **Community College System**:
   - The system serves a diverse student population, including older students (40% are 25+), part-time students (2/3), and working adults balancing education with family and job responsibilities.
   - Workforce training programs, such as welding, soldering, and microelectronics boot camps, are offered in partnership with employers like BAE Systems, providing immediate job opportunities and foundational skills.
   - Healthcare and nursing programs are highly successful, with New Hampshire achieving the highest first-time NCLEX pass rate in the country. Many nursing students are older, already hold degrees, and contribute to workforce retention.

3. **University System**:
   - The system includes UNH, Keene State College, and Plymouth State University, with a total enrollment of 23,000 students.
   - State investment of $95 million in FY25 subsidizes in-state tuition, keeping average net tuition at $7,000. Out-of-state tuition is significantly higher.
   - The system generates a $3.7 billion economic impact and partners with thousands of businesses for internships, research, and curriculum development.

   - Transportation and childcare remain significant barriers for students, particularly those in rural areas. Expanding public transportation and program accessibility is crucial for increasing participation.

2. **Demographic Shifts**:
   - Declining high school enrollments and demographic changes pose challenges for both systems. The university system has seen a 14% enrollment decline since FY19, while the community college system is focusing on lifelong learning and upskilling to address this trend.
   - Competition from other states to retain students is intensifying, necessitating innovative strategies to attract and retain talent.

3. **Fiscal Pressures**:
   - Both systems face budgetary challenges and rely heavily on state funding to maintain affordable tuition and program quality. Potential budget cuts could impact their financial stability and ability to deliver high-quality education.
