### Comprehensive Summary: NH House of Representatives Meeting on Education Funding (January 16, 2025)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 16, 2025, centered on debates surrounding two key bills: **House Bill 15 (HB15)** and **House Bill 115 (HB 115)**, both proposing expansions to the **Education Freedom Account (EFA)** program. EFAs are state-funded vouchers that allow parents to use public education funds for private schooling, homeschooling, or other educational expenses. The meeting featured extensive testimonies from parents, educators, students, and representatives, revealing a deep divide over the merits and drawbacks of the EFA program.

### **Key Points from the Testimonies:**

#### **Support for Expanding EFAs:**
1. **Parental Choice and Flexibility**: Proponents argued that EFAs empower families to choose the best educational path for their children, whether public, private, or homeschool. They emphasized that education funding should follow the student, not the system, and highlighted the success stories of children who thrived in alternative educational settings.
2. **Middle-Class Access**: Advocates noted that the current income eligibility threshold (350% of the poverty level) excludes many middle-class families who struggle to afford private or alternative education options. Removing income limits would make EFAs more accessible to these families.
3. **Special Needs and Safety Concerns**: Parents of children with special needs or those facing bullying in public schools testified that EFAs allowed them to access better educational environments tailored to their children’s needs. Some shared personal stories of their children flourishing in private schools with EFA support.
4. **Cost Savings and Efficiency**: Supporters claimed that EFAs save taxpayers money by reducing the per-pupil cost of public education. They also argued that competition from private schools would improve educational outcomes and incentivize public schools to innovate.

#### **Opposition to Expanding EFAs:**
1. **Public School Funding**: Opponents argued that EFAs divert critical funds from public schools, which serve the majority of students, including low-income families, students with disabilities, and English language learners. They warned that expanding EFAs would exacerbate existing funding shortfalls, leading to larger class sizes, reduced programs, and higher local taxes.
2. **Lack of Accountability and Oversight**: Critics raised concerns about the lack of transparency and accountability in how EFA funds are spent, citing instances of misuse and insufficient oversight. Unlike public schools, private schools and homeschooling programs are not subject to the same academic standards or performance evaluations.
3. **Equity Concerns**: Opponents argued that EFAs primarily benefit wealthier families who can already afford private education, while many lower-income families remain unable to access these options. They emphasized that public schools are legally mandated to accept all students, ensuring equitable access to education.
4. **Special Education and Inclusion**: Public schools are federally required to provide individualized education plans (IEPs) and comprehensive services for students with disabilities, while private schools often lack the resources or legal obligations to do so. Critics warned that EFAs could lead to increased segregation of students with disabilities and reduced access to specialized services.
5. **Constitutional and Fiscal Concerns**: Some opponents argued that the state’s constitutional duty is to fund public education, not private or religious schools, and that expanding EFAs undermines this obligation. They also warned that the estimated $100-130 million annual cost of universal EFAs could deplete the state’s education trust fund and increase the financial burden on taxpayers.

### **Special Education and Inclusivity:**
- **Supporters** of EFAs highlighted their ability to provide tailored educational opportunities for students with unique needs, including those with disabilities or those in unsafe school environments.
- **Opponents** emphasized that public schools are better equipped to provide comprehensive services for students with disabilities, as mandated by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). They warned that withdrawing from public schools could result in the loss of these federally protected rights.

### **Public Schools’ Role:**
- Many speakers underscored the importance of adequately funding public schools, which serve as foundational institutions for equitable education and community building. They shared stories of how public schools have positively shaped students’ lives and urged lawmakers to prioritize public education.
- Critics of EFAs argued that public schools are the backbone of the state’s education system and should be fully funded to ensure equitable opportunities for all students, regardless of income or location.

---

### **Religious Schools and Separation of Church and State:**
- Some opponents raised constitutional concerns about EFAs being used to fund religious schools, arguing that this violates the separation of church and state.
- Supporters countered that EFAs provide parents with the freedom to choose religious or secular education, and the funds are directed by parents, not the state.

---

### **Fiscal Responsibility and Accountability:**
- Critics of EFAs called for greater transparency and oversight, including annual audits and stricter eligibility criteria, to ensure compliance with state laws.
- Supporters argued that EFAs are a cost-effective way to provide educational choice and flexibility for families, but opponents warned of the potential long-term fiscal consequences, including increased property taxes and budget deficits.

### **Conclusion:**
The meeting highlighted a deep divide between those who view EFAs as a means to expand educational opportunities and those who see them as a threat to public education and equity. Supporters emphasized the importance of parental choice, flexibility, and competition, while opponents stressed the need to adequately fund public schools, ensure accountability, and uphold the state’s constitutional obligations. Lawmakers were urged to consider the broader implications of expanding EFAs on students, families, and communities before voting on HB 15 and HB 115. The debate underscored the complex interplay between educational choice, equity, and fiscal responsibility in New Hampshire’s education system.
