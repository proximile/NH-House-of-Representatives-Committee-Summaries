**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Transportation Committee Meeting (01/14/2025)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Transportation Committee convened on January 14, 2025, for a comprehensive session that covered introductions, procedural guidelines, presentations from state departments, and discussions on key transportation-related issues. The meeting was divided into four segments, each focusing on different aspects of the committee’s work, including committee orientation, legislative processes, departmental updates, and funding challenges.

### **Committee Introductions and Orientation**
The session began with committee members introducing themselves, sharing their backgrounds, terms served, and enthusiasm for transportation-related issues such as aerospace, road safety, and infrastructure. The meeting commenced with the Pledge of Allegiance, followed by presentations from various state departments.

### **Presentations from State Departments**
1. **Department of Safety**: Assistant Commissioner Steve Lavoy provided an overview of the department’s seven divisions, including State Police, Marine Patrol, and Motor Vehicles. He emphasized their roles in law enforcement, emergency management, and highway fund revenue collection.
2. **State Police**: Captain Matt Amuchi detailed the State Police’s structure, operations, and challenges, including staffing shortages and increased call volumes. He highlighted specialized units like the K9 team, bomb squad, and aviation unit.
3. **Marine Patrol**: Captain Tim Dunleavy outlined the Marine Patrol’s responsibilities, including law enforcement on public waters, boating education, and maintaining aids to navigation. He noted recruitment challenges and the unit’s role in homeland security.
4. **Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV)**: Director John Morasco introduced the DMV’s leadership team and highlighted the agency’s focus on efficient customer service, handling approximately 400,000 in-person transactions annually.

### **Highway Fund and Funding Challenges**
The committee discussed the highway fund’s importance for funding transportation and safety initiatives, noting a structural deficit and reliance on general fund transfers. The highway fund, which is the primary source of revenue for the operating budget, was only about 57% appropriated for highway-related expenses in 2024, with the remainder allocated to other agencies and local municipalities. Challenges such as inflation, workforce vacancies, and declining revenues from fuel taxes were highlighted, with the rise of electric vehicles further complicating revenue sustainability.

### **Committee Procedures and Legislative Processes**
The chair explained the process for adopting amendments (via voice vote) and committee recommendations (via roll call). The committee emphasized the importance of creating detailed committee reports, especially for non-unanimous bills, which allow the minority to submit a Minority Report. The committee culture was noted for its collegiality and respectful nature, despite differences of opinion.

### **DMV and DOT Operations**
1. **DMV**: The DMV is phasing in a new vendor for license production, upgrading its phone system, and exploring a move to a new location in Raymond to address space constraints. The agency is also focusing on fraud detection, employee safety, and training.
2. **DOT**: The DOT manages 4,600 miles of state roadways, 2,160 state bridges, and 25 public airports. They face a 25% vacancy rate in permanent positions, impacting their ability to maintain infrastructure. The DOT’s $700 million budget is divided into municipal aid/construction and operating expenses, with federal funds supporting most construction projects.

### **Legislative Bills and Initiatives**
The committee discussed several legislative bills, including those related to vehicle inspections, driver’s licenses, and the "blue envelope" bill for individuals with autism. The DMV is also considering bills to validate online license renewal receipts and address issues with vertical licenses for those turning 21 on weekends.

### **Committee Resources and Operations**
The chair reminded members of the administrative support available, including researchers and assistants, and encouraged new members to seek help when needed. The process for organizing caucuses was explained, with the ranking member managing Democratic caucuses and the vice chairman handling Republican ones. The chair anticipated public hearings for the following Tuesday and encouraged members to monitor the calendar for updates.

### **Conflict of Interest and Recusal**
Members were reminded of the importance of recusing themselves from discussions or votes where they may have a conflict of interest, especially in light of new financial disclosure requirements.

### **Closing Remarks**
The chair encouraged a lighthearted and collaborative atmosphere, emphasizing the importance of laughter and respect in committee interactions. Members were reminded to stay informed about upcoming hearings and bills.

### **Overall Focus**
The meeting focused on orienting new committee members, understanding the roles of key state departments, addressing challenges in transportation and public safety, and reviewing recurring and new legislative proposals in the transportation sector. The committee emphasized procedural clarity, resource availability, and collaborative decision-making to effectively manage the state’s transportation needs.
