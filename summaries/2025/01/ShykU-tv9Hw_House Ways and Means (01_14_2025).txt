### **Key Themes and Discussions**

#### **1. Housing Crisis and Affordability**
New Hampshire is grappling with a severe housing crisis, characterized by a significant shortage of affordable housing and rising home prices. Since 2016, the median home price has surged by 105% to $514,000, while median income has only increased by 50%. The state’s housing inventory is critically low at 1.9 months of supply, far below the balanced market benchmark of 6 months. This has made housing unaffordable for many residents, with median-income families able to afford only 58% of the median home price.

- **Root Causes**: The decline in housing construction since the Great Recession, restrictive zoning laws (e.g., large lot requirements for single-family homes), and a shift away from building smaller, more affordable "starter homes" have exacerbated the crisis.
- **Impact**: High housing costs are straining household budgets, with 60% of residents viewing housing availability as a major problem. The lack of affordable housing is also hindering workforce retention and business growth.
- **Policy Solutions**: Legislators emphasized the need for regulatory reform, including easing zoning restrictions, promoting infill development, and encouraging accessory dwelling units (ADUs). Increased investment in infrastructure to support housing development was also highlighted.

#### **2. Economic and Workforce Challenges**
New Hampshire’s economy remains strong, with a low unemployment rate of 2.5% and a favorable business tax climate (ranked 6th nationally). However, the state faces significant workforce challenges due to housing affordability, rising energy costs, and limited childcare options.

- **Labor Market Trends**: Job postings have declined since their 2022 peak, signaling a cooling labor market. The quit rate has also decreased, suggesting workers are less willing to leave their jobs amid economic uncertainty.
- **Childcare Crisis**: The lack of affordable childcare is a major barrier to workforce participation, particularly for prime working-age individuals. Childcare costs are prohibitively high, with center-based care for an infant and a four-year-old costing nearly $32,000 annually.
- **Policy Solutions**: Legislators discussed the need to increase housing supply, support childcare providers, and potentially adjust tax policies to enhance economic competitiveness.

#### **3. Energy Costs and Economic Competitiveness**
Energy costs have risen sharply in New Hampshire, with electricity prices increasing by 60.7% over the past 15 years. High energy costs are a concern for businesses, particularly manufacturers, and are impacting the state’s economic competitiveness.

- **Policy Solutions**: Legislators called for policy options to reduce energy costs, including exploring renewable energy investments and improving energy efficiency.

#### **4. Real Estate and Property Taxes**
The real estate market faces challenges in both residential and commercial sectors. Residential property values have surged, leading to increased property tax burdens for homeowners. Commercial real estate, particularly retail and office spaces, has struggled, with some storefronts remaining vacant.

- **Policy Solutions**: Repurposing underutilized commercial spaces into residential properties and addressing the impact of short-term rentals on housing supply were discussed. Legislators also emphasized the need for a balanced approach to property taxation.

#### **5. State Revenues and Fiscal Responsibility**
State revenues have been volatile, with significant increases during the pandemic followed by declines in 2023 and 2024. Business tax revenues, particularly the Business Profits Tax (BPT), have been a major source of revenue but are declining due to policy changes.

- **Fiscal Challenges**: The state ended fiscal year 2023 with a record surplus of over $500 million, but fiscal year 2024 saw a much smaller surplus of $126 million. Rising housing and childcare costs are major constraints on household budgets, impacting economic growth.
- **Policy Solutions**: Legislators emphasized the need for fiscal responsibility, ensuring state spending aligns with revenue projections and maintaining a balanced budget.

#### **6. Education and School Choice**
The lack of school choice in K-12 education was a key topic of discussion. Legislators highlighted charter schools, open enrollment policies, and Education Freedom Accounts (EFAs) as potential solutions to improve educational outcomes and create a competitive market.

- **Policy Solutions**: Expanding school choice options and improving oversight of EFAs were emphasized as ways to enhance educational quality and parental control.

#### **7. Demographic Trends and Population Growth**
New Hampshire’s population has grown by about 7% from 2010 to 2024, significantly slower than the 25% growth seen from 1980 to 1990. The state is aging, with 20% of the population over 65 and 15% aged 55-64. Immigration, both domestic and international, has been crucial for population growth.

- **Policy Solutions**: Legislators discussed the need for policies that support workforce participation across all age groups and address the challenges posed by an aging population.

#### **8. Economic Freedom and Growth**
New Hampshire ranks highly in economic freedom, which includes low government spending, taxation, and labor market regulations. This has contributed to strong economic growth, low poverty rates, and high employment levels.

- **Policy Solutions**: Maintaining economic freedom, addressing housing and education market inefficiencies, and ensuring fiscal responsibility were emphasized as key priorities.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the interconnected challenges of housing affordability, workforce retention, and economic competitiveness facing New Hampshire. Legislators emphasized the need for comprehensive policy solutions, including regulatory reform, infrastructure investment, and fiscal responsibility, to address these issues and support the state’s continued economic growth and low poverty rates. The discussions highlighted the importance of maintaining economic freedom while addressing critical issues such as housing, childcare, and education to ensure a prosperous future for New Hampshire.
