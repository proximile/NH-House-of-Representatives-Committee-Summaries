**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Session â€“ January 8, 2025**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on January 8, 2025, for its opening session, marking the beginning of the legislative year. The day began with traditional ceremonial activities, including a prayer by Reverend Reed Loy, the Pledge of Allegiance, and a performance of the National Anthem by the Paradigm Quartet. The House then addressed procedural matters, such as granting leaves of absence, introducing guests, and swearing in newly elected representatives and the Sergeant-at-Arms.

A significant portion of the session was dedicated to forming a **Joint Convention** with the Senate to canvass the votes for governor and executive council. **Secretary of State David M. Scanlan** presented the election results, declaring **Kelly Ayotte** the winner of the gubernatorial race with a plurality of votes. Several candidates were also elected to the Executive Council. Following the Joint Convention, the House resumed its session to introduce numerous bills and resolutions.

The House engaged in extensive debates and votes on **amendments to House rules**, addressing a wide range of procedural and operational issues. Key amendments included:

1. **Subpoena Power (House Rule 28)**: A contentious debate arose over an amendment to clarify the process for issuing subpoenas, requiring committee approval and speaker involvement. The amendment failed after a division vote, with concerns about overreach and procedural complexity.

2. **Business Attire (House Rule 2)**: An amendment requiring representatives to wear proper business attire during sessions was debated but ultimately failed, with objections citing enforceability challenges and subjectivity.

3. **Executive Session Notice (House Rule 44)**: An amendment to change the notice requirements for executive sessions passed, balancing arguments for transparency with concerns about maintaining tradition.

4. **Special Order Motions (House Rule 20)**: An amendment to reduce the threshold for special order motions from three-fifths to a simple majority passed, with proponents emphasizing efficiency and opponents warning of potential procedural chaos.

5. **Withdrawal of Bills (House Rule 39e)**: An amendment allowing prime sponsors to withdraw bills later in the legislative process, with co-sponsor concurrence, passed. It was seen as a measure to streamline the legislative process.

6. **Deadly Weapons Display (House Rule 64)**: An amendment clarifying that only the intentional display of deadly weapons is prohibited passed after a roll call vote, addressing concerns about accidental violations.

7. **Bill Sponsorship (House Rule 36e)**: An amendment requiring six co-sponsors for most bills after the first one filed by a representative passed, aiming to ensure bill viability and collaboration.

Additional debates included:

- **Firearms in the Chamber**: A contentious amendment to restore a previous rule prohibiting firearms in the House chamber sparked heated debate. Supporters argued for safety, while opponents emphasized constitutional rights and self-defense. The amendment was ultimately defeated.

- **Committee Operations**: Several amendments addressed committee procedures, including the election of chairs and vice chairs, bill referrals between committees, and the handling of minority reports. These aimed to improve transparency and fairness in committee operations.

- **Public Notice for Hearings**: An amendment proposing to extend the public notice period for hearings from three to ten days was debated. Supporters argued it would enhance public participation, while opponents cited logistical challenges. The amendment failed in a close vote.

- **Gender-Neutral Language**: An amendment to replace gendered terms like "chairman" with gender-neutral alternatives like "chair" sparked debate over language usage and inclusivity. The amendment was defeated.

The session concluded with **announcements**, including an invitation to a disability advocacy event and reminders about upcoming training sessions and the inauguration ceremony. The House adjourned and will reconvene on **January 9, 2025**, for a joint convention to hear the report on the gubernatorial election results and the inauguration of the governor.

Throughout the session, representatives engaged in detailed and often passionate debates on rule changes, balancing tradition, efficiency, and transparency in legislative processes. The session highlighted the complexities of governing and the diverse perspectives within the House.
