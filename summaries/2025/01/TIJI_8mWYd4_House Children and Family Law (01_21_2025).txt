The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting covered a wide range of topics, with a primary focus on **child welfare, juvenile justice, family law, and legislative proposals** aimed at improving systems and addressing challenges in these areas. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key discussions and themes:

### **Child Welfare and Juvenile Justice**
1. **Bureau of Child Support Services**:  
   - **Lisa Decowski**, bureau chief, outlined the mission of the Bureau of Child Support Services to promote responsible parenting and family self-sufficiency. Services include locating absent parents, establishing paternity, and enforcing child support orders. The program has been effective in reducing child poverty and promoting economic mobility.

2. **Division for Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF)**:  
   - **Marie Nunan**, DCYF director, discussed the division’s strategic priorities, including transforming the juvenile justice system through diversion programs and community-based services. She highlighted the decrease in youth placements and the increase in kinship care. DCYF’s 2025-2026 priorities include improving case practice, expanding service arrays, building a new youth detention center, and implementing a new electronic case management system.

3. **Behavioral Health and Children’s System of Care**:  
   - The Division of Behavioral Health, led by **Kya Fox** and **Daryl Tenny**, presented an overview of the Children’s System of Care, emphasizing trauma-informed, family-driven, and community-based services. Programs like Fast Forward (intensive support for youth) and mobile crisis response were highlighted, along with partnerships with schools and mental health centers.

### **Family Law and Military Retirement Pay**
1. **House Bill 170 (Military Retirement Pay in Divorce)**:  
   - The bill seeks to redefine military retirement pay as **disposable retired pay** rather than property in divorce settlements, giving judges more discretion to structure fairer settlements. Testimonies, including from **Representative Mike Moffett** and retired Air Force Major **Larry White**, highlighted the financial burden on military retirees who face non-terminating payments to former spouses. The bill aims to align New Hampshire law with federal definitions and provide flexibility in divorce settlements.

2. **Child Support Reporting and Enforcement**:  
   - **House Bill 204** addressed the reporting of child support arrears to federal agencies, particularly the issue of passport denials for minor delinquencies (e.g., as low as 4 cents). **Representative James Spillane** shared a personal experience of passport denial due to a $6 delinquency, emphasizing the need for transparency and threshold-based reporting. The Bureau of Child Support Services stated it complies with federal guidelines but acknowledged the need for clearer processes.

3. **Wage Garnishment for Child Support (House Bill 213)**:  
   - The bill aims to notify parties during divorce proceedings about their right to avoid wage garnishment for child support if both agree. Concerns were raised about the fiscal impact of creating a new form for this notification, prompting the committee to request a fiscal note before proceeding.

### **False Reporting of Child Abuse and Neglect**
1. **House Bill 243**:  
   - The bill proposes penalties for knowingly false reports of child abuse or neglect and for professional mandatory reporters who fail to report suspected abuse. Testimonies highlighted the emotional, financial, and reputational harm caused by false accusations, particularly in contentious family disputes. Opponents, including **Emily Lawrence** of Waypoint and **Lisa Masio** of the Office of the Child Advocate, argued that the bill could deter legitimate reporting. Supporters, such as **Katherine Shay** and **Adam Kaufman**, shared personal experiences of being falsely accused, advocating for accountability for malicious reporters.

### **Judicial Branch and Family Treatment Courts**
1. **Circuit Court Overview**:  
   - **Judge Ellen Christo**, administrative judge of the New Hampshire Circuit Court, provided an overview of the court’s operations, which handle family, probate, and district matters. The court emphasizes mediation and arbitration in family cases, particularly in divorce and parenting disputes.

2. **Family Treatment Courts**:  
   - The Family Treatment Court program, initially piloted in Newport and expanded to Manchester, focuses on parents with substance abuse issues involved in abuse and neglect cases. The program provides intensive wrap-around services to support reunification and reduce recidivism.

### **Key Themes and Concerns**
- **Prevention and Community Engagement**:  
   Across discussions, there was a strong emphasis on prevention, community-based services, and reducing system involvement for families and youth.

- **Fairness and Accountability**:  
   Legislative proposals like HB 170 and HB 243 aimed to address fairness in family law and accountability in reporting systems, balancing the need to protect individuals from harm while ensuring systems are not misused.

- **Systemic Challenges**:  
   Issues such as minor child support delinquencies leading to passport denials, delays in court proceedings, and the complexities of proving false reporting highlighted systemic inefficiencies that require legislative and procedural improvements.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the importance of strategic planning, collaboration, and legislative action to address challenges in child welfare, family law, and the juvenile justice system. The discussions reflected a commitment to improving outcomes for families, ensuring fairness in legal processes, and protecting children from abuse while preventing the misuse of reporting systems. Further review and potential amendments to proposed bills were planned to address concerns and unintended consequences.
