The New Hampshire House Committee on Housing convened on January 21, 2025, to discuss several key housing-related bills, with a primary focus on **HB 60**, which proposes changes to landlord-tenant eviction laws. The meeting also addressed other bills, including **HB 351**, **HB 399**, **HB 296**, **HB 444**, **HB 65**, and **HB 309**, reflecting the state’s ongoing efforts to address its severe housing crisis. Here is a comprehensive summary of the discussions:

### **HB 60: Landlord-Tenant Relationships and Evictions**
**HB 60**, which has previously passed the House three times but failed in the Senate, seeks to allow landlords to terminate leases without cause after the lease term ends with 60 days’ notice. The bill sparked intense debate, with stakeholders divided over its implications.

- **Support for HB 60**:  
  - Prime sponsor **Rep. Bob Lynn** argued that current law, based on a 2005 Supreme Court decision, prevents landlords from evicting tenants after a fixed-term lease ends, undermining contract principles. He contended that landlords should have the right to decide whether to renew a lease.  
  - Supporters, including the **New Hampshire Association of Realtors**, claimed the bill would provide clarity and certainty for landlords, encouraging them to rent out more properties, particularly "mom-and-pop" landlords hesitant under current laws.  

- **Opposition to HB 60**:  
  - Opponents, including tenant advocates and organizations like the **Home for All Coalition** and the **NH Coalition to End Homelessness**, argued that the bill would exacerbate homelessness, housing instability, and economic hardship, particularly for vulnerable populations such as seniors, low-income families, and individuals with disabilities.  
  - Testimonies from tenants like **Victoria Maritz**, **Ann Marie Rook**, and **Alyssa Antman** highlighted personal struggles with housing insecurity and discrimination, emphasizing the human cost of no-cause evictions.  
  - Legal experts noted that the bill would undermine existing just-cause eviction laws and tenant protections, potentially increasing homelessness and straining social services.  

- **Housing Crisis Context**:  
  - The discussion took place against the backdrop of New Hampshire’s severe housing shortage, with a 0% vacancy rate, rising rents, and a lack of affordable housing. Opponents warned that HB 60 would worsen the crisis by making it easier to displace tenants without cause.  

### **HB 351: Eviction Notice Periods**
**HB 351**, introduced by **Rep. Matthew Pataro**, seeks to align eviction notice periods for tenant-at-will agreements. Currently, tenants must give 60 days’ notice to leave, while landlords only need to provide 30 days. The bill would require landlords to also give 60 days’ notice.  

- **Support for HB 351**:  
  - Supporters framed the bill as addressing an inequity in the law, ensuring fairness and equity for tenants.  
  - The bill received significant public support, with 14 in favor and 2 against based on sign-in sheets.  

- **Opposition to HB 351**:  
  - Opponents, including landlords, argued that extending the notice period would prolong the eviction process, especially for problematic tenants, and negatively impact other tenants.  

### **HB 399: Zoning Enabling Act Study**
**HB 399**, introduced by **Rep. Joe Alexander**, proposes establishing a bipartisan commission to study the 100-year-old New Hampshire Zoning Enabling Act (RSA 674). The commission would examine the evolution of zoning laws, court interpretations, and local zoning powers.  

- **Support for HB 399**:  
  - Supporters, including **Greg Moore** (Americans for Prosperity) and **Drew Klein** (Josiah Bartlett Center for Public Policy), emphasized the need for a comprehensive review of zoning regulations to address the state’s housing crisis.  
  - An amendment introduced by **Rep. Paige** to ensure bipartisan appointments to the commission passed unanimously (16-0).  

- **Next Steps**:  
  - The bill, as amended, passed unanimously and was recommended for further consideration on the regular calendar.  

### **HB 296: Private Road Development**
**HB 296**, introduced by **Rep. Rick Lad**, proposes streamlining the permitting process for building on private roads by shifting review from planning boards to select boards.  

- **Support for HB 296**:  
  - Supporters argued that the bill would expedite housing development and address the state’s housing crisis by reducing lengthy and costly permitting processes.  

- **Concerns**:  
  - **Margaret Burns** (NH Municipal Association) supported the bill but noted a typo in the text and suggested mirroring a similar process for class six roads.  
  - **Attorney Paul Alano** expressed concerns that the bill could complicate the process and suggested focusing solely on ensuring emergency vehicle access to lots.  

### **HB 444: Tenant Opportunity to Purchase**
**HB 444**, introduced by **Rep. Allen Reed**, would give tenants in multifamily housing (5+ units) a 60-day notice before a sale, allowing them to form a cooperative and submit a competing offer.  

- **Support for HB 444**:  
  - Reed emphasized the importance of homeownership in addressing the housing crisis, citing the success of a similar law for manufactured housing parks.  

- **Opposition to HB 444**:  
  - Opponents, including **Chris Freeman** and **Nick Norman**, argued that the 60-day notice could be burdensome for sellers, complicate portfolio sales, and may not be feasible for all tenants due to financial constraints.  

### **HB 65: Rent Reporting to Credit Bureaus**
**HB 65** would require landlords to report rent payments to credit bureaus to help tenants build credit.  

- **Support for HB 65**:  
  - Some landlords supported the concept, noting it could benefit tenants.  

- **Concerns**:  
  - Others raised concerns about the administrative burden and costs, leading to proposals for amendments and a potential study committee.  

### **HB 309: Optional Electronic Payments**
**HB 309** would prohibit landlords from requiring tenants to pay rent exclusively through electronic means.  

- **Support for HB 309**:  
  - Supporters, including tenants, particularly seniors, highlighted concerns about online banking and preferred traditional payment methods like checks.  

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the deep divisions over housing policy in New Hampshire, with debates centered on balancing tenant protections and landlord rights. While bills like **HB 60** and **HB 444** faced significant opposition from tenant advocates, others like **HB 309** and **HB 351** received broader support. The discussions highlighted the urgent need to address the state’s housing crisis through a combination of tenant protections, zoning reform, and streamlined development processes. The committee’s decisions will shape New Hampshire’s housing landscape, with a focus on fairness, equity, and practical solutions.
