**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Meeting on Education Funding (January 21, 2025)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on January 21, 2025, to address several critical issues related to education funding and policy. The meeting featured discussions on multiple bills aimed at improving school infrastructure, ensuring fair disciplinary processes in higher education, enhancing civic literacy, and addressing funding inequities across the state. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points and themes from the meeting:

### **School Building Aid and Infrastructure**
1. **HB 366 – Increasing School Building Aid**:
   - The bill proposes increasing the minimum annual funding for school building aid from $50 million to $60 million to address a $200 million backlog in infrastructure improvements.
   - The bill seeks to rectify the impact of a 10-year moratorium on building aid during the Great Recession, which left many schools with outdated, unsafe, or overcrowded facilities.
   - Equity concerns were highlighted, particularly for property-poor communities that have struggled to fund renovations independently, leading to higher property taxes.
   - Testimonies emphasized the link between building conditions and student outcomes, especially for special education students, who often face out-of-district placements due to inadequate facilities.
   - The bill includes provisions to retroactively fund projects completed during the moratorium and prioritize schools with urgent safety and space needs.

2. **HB 515 – Repealing Charter School Eligibility for Building Aid**:
   - The bill aims to repeal charter schools’ eligibility for state building aid, arguing that limited funds should prioritize traditional public schools with significant infrastructure needs.
   - Opponents of the bill, including the sponsor of the original bill (HB 354) that granted charter schools eligibility, argued that charter schools are public schools and should have access to funding, provided they meet strict criteria.
   - The discussion highlighted broader concerns about education funding, including the challenges of securing facilities for charter schools and the need to address aging infrastructure in traditional public schools.

### **Education Funding Adequacy**
3. **HB 550 – Addressing Education Funding Inequities**:
   - The bill responds to the **Conval lawsuit**, which ruled that the state must increase its base adequacy funding to $7,356 per student to meet its constitutional obligation.
   - Stakeholders testified about the struggles of underfunded schools, including teacher shortages, high turnover rates, and the inability to recruit qualified staff. For example, Newport School District reported being 14 teachers short and spending $27,000 per student annually, with only $4,200 coming from state funding.
   - The bill proposes a $450 million annual increase in state funding to raise the base adequacy amount by $3,200 per student, aiming to alleviate the burden on local property taxpayers and reduce disparities between districts.
   - The discussion emphasized the long-term benefits of investing in education, including economic growth, reduced social costs, and equitable access to resources for all students.

### **Civic Literacy and Higher Education**
4. **HB 112 – Civics Exam Requirement for College Graduation**:
   - The bill extends the civics exam requirement, currently mandated for high school graduation, to associate and bachelor’s degree programs in New Hampshire’s higher education institutions.
   - Supporters argue that the exam promotes civic awareness and engagement, though opponents raised concerns about administrative burdens, costs, and potential barriers for students, particularly those with special needs or limited English proficiency.
   - Amendments were proposed to exempt New Hampshire high school graduates who have already passed the exam and to limit the requirement to associate degree students.
   - The community college system expressed willingness to implement the requirement but highlighted logistical challenges, such as integrating the exam into their learning management systems.

### **Due Process in Higher Education**
5. **HB 510 – Ensuring Due Process Rights in Disciplinary Proceedings**:
   - The bill aims to establish fair disciplinary procedures for students, student organizations, and faculty members at state higher education institutions.
   - Provisions include the right to notice, the presumption of innocence, the right to an advisor or attorney, and the right to remain silent without adverse inference in civil proceedings.
   - The bill addresses concerns raised in a previous version, including delays in disciplinary proceedings and conflicts with collective bargaining agreements.
   - While the sponsor emphasized the need for proactive measures to ensure fairness, some committee members questioned the necessity of the bill, citing existing robust disciplinary procedures.

### **Broader Themes and Challenges**
- **Property Tax Burden**: The heavy reliance on local property taxes to fund education was a recurring theme, with representatives highlighting the disproportionate burden on property-poor communities. Districts with low property values, such as Newport, struggle to raise sufficient funds, exacerbating inequities.
- **Teacher Retention and Salaries**: Low starting salaries and high turnover rates in underfunded districts were cited as significant challenges. For example, Newport School District reported a 45-50% annual turnover rate due to salaries as low as $34,000/year, compared to higher-paying neighboring districts.
- **Long-Term Implications**: The discussions underscored the long-term consequences of underfunding education, including reduced economic opportunities, lower graduation rates, and declining community strength.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the urgent need for addressing New Hampshire’s education funding challenges, particularly in light of the state’s constitutional obligation to provide an adequate education for all students. While there was broad support for increasing funding and improving infrastructure, debates over the allocation of limited resources, the role of charter schools, and the implementation of new requirements like the civics exam revealed significant divisions. The House will continue to evaluate these bills, with a focus on balancing equity, fairness, and fiscal responsibility.
