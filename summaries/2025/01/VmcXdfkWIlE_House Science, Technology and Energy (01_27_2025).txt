**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Science, Technology, and Energy Committee Meeting (January 27, 2025)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee convened on January 27, 2025, to discuss a range of bills focused on energy, technology, and telecommunications. The meeting highlighted key debates around nuclear energy, energy efficiency programs, renewable energy funding, and distributed energy resources (DERs). Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

---

### **1. Nuclear Energy and Clean Energy Definitions (House Bill 189)**
The committee focused on **House Bill 189**, which seeks to include nuclear energy, particularly small-scale nuclear technology, in New Hampshire's definition of clean energy. Key points included:
- **Purpose**: The bill aligns New Hampshire with states like New York and Colorado that have already recognized nuclear energy as clean energy. It aims to signal openness to nuclear technology and attract investment.
- **Debate**: Questions arose about the definition of "small-scale nuclear," concerns over nuclear waste, and the broader implications of defining clean energy. Some members suggested a broader definition of clean energy as non-greenhouse gas-emitting sources.
- **Support**: The Public Utilities Commission (PUC) and a nuclear startup, Starcube, supported the bill, emphasizing the potential for New Hampshire to become a leader in advanced nuclear technology and energy exports.

### **2. Energy Efficiency Programs and Cost-Benefit Analysis (House Bill 221)**
**House Bill 221** addressed changes to the **Granite State Test**, a cost-benefit analysis tool for evaluating energy efficiency programs. Key discussions included:
- **Granite State Test**: Proponents, including utilities like Eversource, argued the test provides stability and predictability, essential for program planning. Critics claimed it excludes societal costs and benefits, such as climate change mitigation.
- **Opposition**: Contractors and low-income advocates opposed the bill, fearing it would disrupt energy efficiency programs, harm businesses, and reduce services to vulnerable populations.
- **Support**: Some stakeholders argued for a more holistic approach to cost-benefit analysis, including environmental and public health impacts.

---

### **3. Renewable Energy Fund and Proposed Bill**
The committee debated a bill that would eliminate the **Renewable Energy Fund (REF)**, redirecting funds back to ratepayers. Key points included:
- **REF Overview**: The REF, funded by alternative compliance payments (ACPs), supports renewable energy projects, including low-income grants and municipal solar initiatives. It has leveraged significant private investment (6:1 ratio).
- **Opposition**: Stakeholders, including renewable energy businesses and environmental groups, opposed the bill, arguing it would undermine renewable energy development, increase long-term energy costs, and harm New Hampshire's energy independence.
- **Economic Impact**: Testifiers highlighted the REF's role in job creation, reducing fossil fuel reliance, and supporting over 100 municipal solar projects.

### **4. Distributed Energy Resources and Competition (House Bills 460 and Related Legislation)**
The committee discussed bills aimed at promoting competition in the DER market, ensuring fair evaluation of utility investments in DERs, and expanding opportunities for third-party developers. Key points included:
- **Purpose**: The bills seek to level the playing field between regulated utilities and competitive market players, promoting innovation and cost savings for customers.
- **Utility Perspective**: Eversource and Unitil expressed concerns that the bills could increase costs for all customers and discourage utility investment in DERs.
- **Support**: Advocates, including the Community Power Coalition, argued the bills would enhance competition and allow third-party developers to access the same benefits as utilities.

---

### **5. Other Key Discussions**
- **Municipal Solar Grant Program**: Over 100 projects are being tracked, with questions raised about cost savings and kilowatt-hour usage calculations.
- **Lifeline Program Expansion (House Bill 627)**: The bill aims to expand affordable telecommunications access for low-income residents by allowing new providers to participate in the federal Lifeline program.
- **Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Commission (House Bill 436)**: The committee briefly discussed a bill proposing a commission to investigate unidentified anomalous phenomena, with some members questioning its relevance.

---

### **6. Field Trip Planning**
The committee considered field trips to energy and technology facilities, such as hydro power plants and the Eversource control room, to enhance their understanding of energy systems.

---

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
The meeting underscored several recurring themes:
- **Clean Energy Transition**: Discussions on nuclear energy, renewable energy funding, and DERs highlighted New Hampshire's efforts to diversify its energy portfolio and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
- **Economic and Environmental Balance**: Stakeholders emphasized the need to balance economic growth, energy affordability, and environmental sustainability.
- **Stakeholder Collaboration**: The committee heard extensive testimony from utilities, contractors, environmental groups, and state agencies, reflecting the complexity of energy policy and the importance of stakeholder input.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted New Hampshire's commitment to advancing clean energy, improving energy efficiency programs, and fostering competition in the energy market. The committee will continue to deliberate on the proposed bills, considering the feedback from various stakeholders to ensure alignment with the state's energy goals and the needs of its residents.
