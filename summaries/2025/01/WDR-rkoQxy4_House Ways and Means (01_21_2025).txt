The January 21, 2025, meeting of the New Hampshire House of Representatives' Ways and Means Committee focused on a wide range of fiscal and legislative matters, including tax revenue discussions, public hearings on proposed bills, and the committee’s role in revenue estimation for the state’s budget. Below is a cohesive and comprehensive summary of the key points from all segments:

---

### **Tax Revenue Overview**
The committee reviewed several major tax revenue streams and their trends, highlighting the following:

1. **Holding Company Transactions**: Most transactions and revenue are concentrated in Hillsboro and Rockingham County, with steady growth from 2015 to 2020 and a significant spike during the pandemic (2020–2022).
2. **Interest and Dividends Tax (IND)**: Repealed effective January 1, 2025, the IND tax saw increased revenue in 2023 due to higher interest rates.
3. **Communication Services Tax (CST)**: A 7% tax on two-way communications (e.g., cell phone bills) has declined over the past decade due to reduced landline usage and increased data consumption.
4. **Medicaid Enhancement Tax (MET)**: A 5.4% tax on net patient services revenue from hospitals supports uncompensated care and Medicaid funds.
5. **Nursing Facility Quality Assessment (NFQA)**: Similar to MET, this tax funds nursing homes and has grown significantly due to an aging population.
6. **Utility Property Tax**: A tax on utility property at $660 per thousand of value, with revenues fluctuating based on property performance.
7. **Local Property Taxes**: The Department of Revenue sets local, school, county, and statewide education property tax (SWEPT) rates, ensuring a minimum of $363 million annually.
8. **RIMS (Revenue Information Management System)**: A modernized tax administration system that has improved revenue collection through reminders, federal tax information usage, and online payment plans.

### **Business Taxes**
The committee discussed the Business Enterprise Tax (BET) and Business Profits Tax (BPT):
- **BET**: A tax on wages, interest, and dividends, with exceptions for 501(c)(3) organizations. The filing threshold is $298,000, and unused credits can be carried forward for 10 years.
- **BPT**: Recently reduced from 7.6% to 7.5%, the BPT is significantly contributed to by a small percentage of large corporations. The committee also reviewed apportionment rules and market-based sourcing for services.

### **Other Key Taxes**
1. **Meals and Rooms Tax (M&R)**: An 8.5% tax on meals, rooms, and motor vehicle rentals, with operators retaining 3% if they file and pay on time. Revenue is allocated to the general fund, education trust fund, and municipal revenue fund.
2. **Tobacco Tax**: Includes taxes on cigarettes ($1.78 per pack), other tobacco products (65.03% of wholesale price), and e-cigarettes (30 cents per milliliter for closed systems, 8% of wholesale price for open systems). Challenges include untaxed e-cigarettes from China and the destruction of contraband products.
3. **Real Estate Transfer Tax**: A rate of 75 cents per $100 of the sale price, with the register of deeds retaining 4% of the face value of stamps. Real estate holding company transactions are reported directly to the Department of Revenue.

### **Public Hearings on Proposed Bills**
1. **House Bill 83 (HB 83)**:
   - **Proposal**: Raise the minimum age for sports betting from 18 to 21.
   - **Rationale**: Young adults (18–20) are more prone to risky behaviors and gambling addiction. Sports betting, often conducted via mobile apps, is highly accessible and addictive.
   - **Fiscal Impact**: In FY 2024, 18–20-year-olds wagered over $14 million, contributing $639,000 in state revenue. Raising the age would reduce gambling addiction but result in a revenue loss of approximately $639,000 annually.
   - **Discussion**: Representatives questioned the difference between sports betting and charitable gaming, the fiscal impact, and comparative gambling behavior across age groups. The sponsor emphasized public health benefits.

2. **House Bill 163 (HB 163)**:
   - **Proposal**: A housekeeping measure to streamline the management of state funds by clarifying definitions, repealing 13 inactive or outdated funds, and improving oversight.
   - **Outcome**: The committee unanimously (15–0) recommended the bill for passage, placing it on the consent calendar for a full House vote.

### **Revenue Estimation and Budget Planning**
The committee emphasized its responsibility for estimating unrestricted revenues, which include the general fund, education trust fund, highway fund, and fishing and game fund. Key points included:
1. **Legislative Budget Assistance Office (LBA)**: Provides fiscal notes, analyzes fiscal impacts, and assists in budget development.
2. **Revenue Trends**: Business taxes remain a significant revenue source, while tobacco tax revenue has declined post-COVID-19 due to changing consumer behavior.
3. **Upcoming Steps**: The committee will continue reviewing agency presentations, preparing revenue estimates, and reconciling differences with the Senate through a potential conference committee.
