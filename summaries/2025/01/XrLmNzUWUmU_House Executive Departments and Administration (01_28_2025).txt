**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Meeting on January 28, 2025: Executive Departments and Administration**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 28, 2025, focused on discussions related to building codes, energy efficiency, and administrative amendments. The meeting included both the full committee and a subcommittee, with debates centered on several key house bills and their potential impact on building standards, enforcement, and energy conservation.

### Key Discussions and Outcomes:

1. **Building Codes and Vapor Barriers (Segment 1/2):**
   - The committee discussed the importance of proper vapor barriers in managing indoor air quality and extending building lifespans by preventing moisture-related issues such as mold and rot.
   - A motion was made to recommend the bill "Ought to Pass" (OTP), with one representative advocating for a positive mindset and further committee discussion. However, another representative opposed the motion, citing the ongoing review process by the Building Code Review Board (BCRB) of the 2024 building codes, which is expected to provide recommendations next year.
   - The committee ultimately voted against the OTP motion, deciding to delay action pending further research and discussion. The meeting concluded with a recess on **House Bill 428**, pending the drafting of an amendment, and a notice for the next subcommittee meeting.

2. **House Bill 428 (Segment 2/2):**
   - The subcommittee focused on an amendment to **HB 428**, presented by Philip Sherman, Chair of the BCRB. The amendment aims to clarify and streamline building code enforcement, focusing on administrative changes while prohibiting technical amendments.
   - The committee debated the implications of the amendment, including enforcement mechanisms for municipalities and the process for confirming amendments through the BCRB. There was also a suggestion to adjust the effective date of a specific paragraph in the bill.
   - The subcommittee decided to schedule another meeting to further discuss the amendment and review additional information.

3. **House Bill 244 (Segment 2/2):**
   - **HB 244** seeks to consolidate building code provisions scattered across various statutes into RSA 155a. Sherman emphasized that the bill is primarily editorial and does not change responsibilities, though it adds significant content to RSA 155a.
   - The committee considered recommending the bill be retained for further review, as more time and stakeholder input are needed to refine it.

4. **House Bill 96 (Segment 2/2):**
   - The discussion on **HB 96** revolved around adopting the 2021 International Energy Conservation Code (IECC). Sherman noted that the BCRB is currently reviewing the 2024 IECC, with recommendations expected by November 2025 and potential updates taking effect by July 2026.
   - The committee expressed concerns about the costs and benefits of adopting the 2021 IECC, especially given New Hampshire’s ongoing housing crisis. There was skepticism about the reported costs and the necessity of mandating the new energy code.
   - Public testimony from Paul Beus, former president of ASHRAE New Hampshire, highlighted the 2021 IECC’s 15% improvement in energy efficiency and its benefits to indoor air quality. Beus also addressed discrepancies in cost estimates, suggesting that actual costs might be lower than previously reported.

### Overall Tone and Next Steps:
The meeting reflected a cautious approach to adopting new building codes and amendments, with a strong emphasis on ensuring clarity, consistency, and stakeholder input. The committee prioritized thorough review and discussion, particularly given the ongoing BCRB review process and the potential financial and administrative implications of the new codes. 

Next steps include:
- Drafting an amendment to **HB 428** and scheduling another subcommittee meeting to discuss it further.
- Retaining **HB 244** for additional review and stakeholder input.
- Continuing to evaluate the costs and benefits of adopting the 2021 IECC under **HB 96**, with further discussions expected in future meetings.

The committee’s deliberations underscored the importance of balancing regulatory updates with practical considerations, particularly in the context of New Hampshire’s housing and energy challenges.
