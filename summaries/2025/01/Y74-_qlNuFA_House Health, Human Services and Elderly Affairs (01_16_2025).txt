The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs Committee convened on January 16, 2025, for a comprehensive meeting addressing a wide range of topics related to health, human services, and elderly care. The meeting featured presentations from key department leaders, discussions on Medicaid and public health programs, and strategic planning for the state’s aging population and behavioral health needs. Here is a cohesive summary of the key points:

---

### **Medicaid and Health Services Overview**
1. **Medicaid Program**:
   - The Managed Care program oversees Medicaid services, excluding Medicaid expansion (Granite Advantage Healthcare Program). The state has successfully processed eligibility verifications post the public health emergency.
   - Medicaid expenditures on drugs and pharmaceuticals have nearly doubled over the past seven years, driven by the rise in gene and cell therapies, particularly for children. Efforts to acquire drugs more cost-effectively and implement provider rate increases are underway.
   - The 1115 waiver, renewed in July 2024, focuses on inpatient substance use disorder and psychiatric care, with new community re-entry services for adults and limited benefit programs for youth.

2. **New Hampshire Hospital**:
   - The state’s inpatient acute adult psychiatric hospital has reached full capacity. Efforts to eliminate emergency department (ED) boarding, including the role of Care Traffic Control (CTC), have been successful, with zero queue achieved on several occasions. However, discharge delays persist due to resource shortages in the community.

3. **Division of Program Quality and Integrity**:
   - This division supports data-driven decision-making, quality management, and performance improvement. The Bureau of Program Integrity handles reviews, investigations, and compliance, while the Office of Internal Audit focuses on internal reviews and fraud investigations.

2. **Public Health Services**:
   - Ian Watt, Director of the Division of Public Health Services, highlighted programs like WIC (Women, Infants, and Children) and the therapeutic cannabis program. The division focuses on disease prevention, health education, and emergency response.
