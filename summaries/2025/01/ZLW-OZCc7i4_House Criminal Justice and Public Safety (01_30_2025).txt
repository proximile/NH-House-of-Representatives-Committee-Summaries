**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Meeting on Criminal Justice and Public Safety (January 30, 2025)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 30, 2025, focused on several bills related to firearms, public safety, and self-defense tools. The discussions centered on balancing public safety with constitutional rights, particularly the Second Amendment, and addressed issues such as gun control, voter intimidation, and the regulation of self-defense tools. Below is a cohesive summary of the key bills and debates:

---

### **House Bill 56: Prohibiting Firearms for High-Risk Groups and Mandatory Waiting Periods**
- **Purpose**: The bill proposes universal background checks for firearm purchases and a mandatory 72-hour waiting period before transferring a firearm.
- **Support**: Advocates, including mental health professionals and organizations like Moms Demand Action, argued that these measures would reduce gun-related homicides, suicides, and impulsive acts of violence. Personal testimonies highlighted the potential lifesaving impact of waiting periods.
- **Opposition**: Critics, including Joe Hannah of Gun Owners of New Hampshire, contended that the bill infringes on Second Amendment rights and places undue burdens on law-abiding citizens. Opponents also argued that criminals would circumvent the law and that the bill does not address the root causes of violence.
- **Key Concerns**: Debate focused on whether waiting periods endanger those needing immediate self-defense and whether universal background checks effectively close loopholes in private firearm sales.

### **House Bill 352: Prohibiting Firearms at Polling Places**
- **Purpose**: The bill seeks to prohibit firearms at polling places to prevent voter intimidation and ensure safe, neutral spaces for voting.
- **Support**: Proponents, including election officials, cited historical and recent examples of armed individuals intimidating voters and emphasized the importance of protecting democracy.
- **Opposition**: Critics argued that the bill infringes on Second Amendment rights and creates "victim zones" by disarming law-abiding citizens. They also raised concerns about the security of firearms left in vehicles.
- **Outcome**: The bill was ultimately deemed inexpedient to legislate, with calls for amendments to focus on *intentional display* of firearms rather than a blanket prohibition.

- **Purpose**: The bill establishes clear timeframes for the return of firearms and ammunition seized under court orders (e.g., bail conditions or restraining orders).
- **Support**: Constituents and representatives shared personal stories of delays in retrieving firearms, emphasizing the need for a streamlined process to protect due process rights.

### **House Bill 609: Strengthening New Hampshire’s Preemption Statute**
- **Purpose**: The bill aims to expand the state’s preemption statute (RSA 159:26) to include non-lethal self-defense tools (e.g., pepper spray, tasers) and prevent state agencies from imposing restrictions on these tools.
- **Support**: Proponents argued that the bill protects individual rights to self-defense, removes redundant regulations, and ensures consistency in state laws. It also addresses a loophole where state agencies disarm employees, citing a tragic incident involving Officer Bradley Haas.
- **Concerns**: Questions were raised about potential conflicts with existing laws in secure facilities like prisons and schools. Testifiers suggested amendments to address these issues.
