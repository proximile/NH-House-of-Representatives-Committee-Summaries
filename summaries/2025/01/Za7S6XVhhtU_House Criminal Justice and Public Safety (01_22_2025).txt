     - Improving oversight of massage businesses through a statewide database.
     - Addressing challenges such as language barriers, victims' fear of deportation, and traffickers' exploitation of immigrants.

### **2. Child Welfare and Protection**
   - **House Bill 194 (Interference with Custody)**: This bill aimed to strengthen penalties for interference with child custody, escalating offenses to felonies for repeat violations. Discussions centered on balancing parental rights with the emotional well-being of children and addressing systemic enforcement challenges.
   - **House Bill 257 (Criminal Neglect of a Child – Charlotte’s Law)**: The bill proposed establishing criminal neglect as a distinct crime to address gaps in current statutes. Supporters emphasized the need for earlier intervention in neglect cases, while opponents cautioned against criminalizing poverty or unintentional neglect.

### **4. Immigration Enforcement**
   - **House Bill 511 (Sanctuary Policies)**: This bill sought to prohibit sanctuary policies in New Hampshire and mandate cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities. Supporters argued it would enhance public safety by ensuring consistent enforcement of immigration laws. Opponents raised concerns about constitutional issues, eroding trust between immigrant communities and law enforcement, and potential liability for local governments. Testimonies highlighted the risks of deterring crime reporting and the disproportionate impact on vulnerable immigrant populations.
