**Summary of the NH House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee Meeting (01/30/2025)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee convened on January 30, 2025, to discuss several key bills, focusing on cannabis legalization, paint recycling, alcohol sales regulations, and the privatization of the Liquor Commission. Below is a comprehensive summary of the meeting’s key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **1. Cannabis Legalization (House Bill 186)**
The committee extensively debated **House Bill 186**, which proposes to legalize, regulate, and tax the sale of cannabis in New Hampshire. Key points included:

- **Bill Overview**:  
  The bill aims to legalize cannabis possession, sales, and regulation, modeled after a similar bill that passed nearly unanimously in 2023. It introduces an **8.5% room and meals tax** to keep taxes low, ensuring competitiveness with neighboring states like Massachusetts, Vermont, and Maine. An **independent cannabis commission** would oversee implementation and create regulations.

- **Motivation**:  
  Prime sponsor Representative Sullivan argued that arresting people for cannabis possession is “ridiculous” and emphasized the need to prevent New Hampshire residents from spending money in neighboring states where cannabis is legal.

- **Public Safety and Restrictions**:  
  Public smoking of cannabis would remain **prohibited**, with fines starting at $100 and escalating for repeat offenses. Employers can enforce policies against workplace impairment, though the bill does not set a specific THC impairment standard.

- **Law Enforcement Concerns**:  
  The New Hampshire Association of Chiefs of Police opposed the bill, citing concerns about impaired driving, federal firearm laws (which prohibit cannabis users from possessing firearms), and the lack of a reliable THC impairment test. They also expressed concerns about home cultivation reducing state revenue and increasing unregulated cannabis availability.

- **Support for the Bill**:  
  Supporters highlighted the potential for revenue generation, reduced unnecessary arrests, and alignment with neighboring states and Canada. Dr. Joe Hannon, a former committee member and cannabis advocate, emphasized the bill’s benefits, including reducing racial disparities in enforcement and creating a regulated market.

- **Impaired Driving**:  
  The lack of a legal THC impairment limit poses enforcement challenges. Supporters noted that cannabis impairment is less dangerous than alcohol but still carries risks.

- **Next Steps**:  
  The bill will move to a subcommittee for further review and refinement.

### **2. Paint Recycling Program (House Bill 451)**
The committee held a public hearing on **House Bill 451**, which proposes a **post-consumer paint stewardship program** to recycle leftover paint and reduce its environmental impact. Key points included:

- **Program Overview**:  
  The bill establishes a voluntary, industry-supported program where consumers can return leftover paint to participating retailers or municipal collection sites for recycling. Manufacturers fund the program through a small fee added to the price of paint at the point of sale.

- **Environmental and Economic Benefits**:  
  The program aims to **divert paint from landfills**, recycle latex paint into new products, and use solvent-based paint for waste-to-energy recovery. It will **reduce costs for municipalities** by eliminating the need for expensive hazardous waste collection days and **save taxpayer dollars** by reducing landfill usage.

- **Stakeholder Support**:  
  The bill has **broad bipartisan support** from the paint industry, municipal associations, environmental groups, and solid waste management organizations. **PaintCare**, a nonprofit created by the paint industry, will manage the program.

- **Fee Structure**:  
  A small **assessment fee** (e.g., $1.75 for a gallon of paint) will fund the program, ensuring it is self-funded and imposes no additional costs on the state.

- **Legislative History**:  
  Similar legislation passed unanimously in the House last year but was interim studied to refine the program. The current bill is seen as an **improved version**, tailored to New Hampshire’s needs.

### **3. Alcohol Sales Regulations and Liquor Commission Privatization**
The committee also addressed several bills related to alcohol sales and the Liquor Commission:

- **Alcohol Sales Regulations (House Bill 81)**:  
  The committee amended the bill to prohibit patrons from taking alcoholic beverages into restaurant restrooms. The amendment passed unanimously, and the bill was placed on the consent calendar.

- **Scanner Regulations (House Bill 77)**:  
  The bill was amended to ensure that scanners used in alcohol and tobacco sales do not store personal information. The Liquor Commission will enforce this regulation, and violators risk losing their licenses. The amendment passed, and the bill was placed on the consent calendar.

- **Privatization of the Liquor Commission (House Bill 79)**:  
  The committee voted against establishing a commission to study the privatization of the Liquor Commission, deeming it “inexpedient to legislate.” The motion passed with a vote of 10-8, and a minority report was expected.

### **4. Other Discussions**
The committee briefly touched on hazardous waste management, emphasizing the environmental and public health benefits of proper waste disposal and the financial impact on municipalities. Testimonies from stakeholders highlighted the potential for improved recycling efforts and reduced costs for local governments.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting showcased a mix of support and opposition across various bills, with debates focusing on public safety, economic benefits, and regulatory challenges. Key decisions included advancing the cannabis legalization and paint recycling bills, amending alcohol sales regulations, and rejecting the privatization of the Liquor Commission. The committee demonstrated a strong focus on environmental protection, consumer safety, and fiscal responsibility, with many bills reflecting collaborative, bipartisan efforts to address pressing issues.
