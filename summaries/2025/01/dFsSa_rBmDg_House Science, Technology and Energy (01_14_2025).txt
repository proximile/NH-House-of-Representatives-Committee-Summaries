### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Science, Technology, and Energy Committee Meeting (January 14, 2025)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee convened on January 14, 2025, to address a wide range of critical issues related to energy, infrastructure, environmental protection, and climate change. The meeting featured presentations, discussions, and testimonies on key topics, including dam maintenance and hydropower, air quality and energy programs, renewable energy integration, grid reliability, and the financial impacts of climate change. Below is a cohesive summary of the key themes and discussions from the meeting:

---

#### **1. Dam Maintenance and Hydropower**
- **Challenges with State-Owned Dams**: New Hampshire inherited a large inventory of dams in the 1970s, many of which are over 100 years old. The state faces a $414 million backlog to bring dams up to current standards, with 64 classified as high-hazard due to downstream development.
- **Funding Shortfalls**: Annual maintenance costs are $7.5 million, but revenue from leased hydropower sites has declined since the 1990s. Proposed solutions include a $158 per linear foot fee for shoreline property owners and a $5 increase in boat registration fees.
- **Hydropower and Environmental Concerns**: The state manages eight hydropower dams and 26 water user agreements. Challenges include relicensing costs, fish passage improvements, and balancing environmental protections with energy production.
- **Dam Removal**: Removing dams is controversial due to local opposition, despite the benefits of reducing risks and costs. Examples like Goose Pond Dam illustrate the impact on water levels and shoreline properties.

---

#### **2. Air Quality and Energy Programs**
- **Air Quality Monitoring**: New Hampshire monitors air quality at 13 sites, focusing on ozone, fine particulate matter, and transport pollution from other regions and Canadian wildfires.
- **Pollution Reduction Efforts**: Programs like wood stove change-outs and regional initiatives (e.g., NESCAUM) have improved air quality. The state is also using Volkswagen settlement funds ($31 million) to expand EV charging infrastructure.
- **Climate Action**: New Hampshire received a $3 million EPA grant to develop a climate action plan. A $450 million heat pump accelerator program aims to install 500,000 heat pumps in New England over the next decade.

#### **3. Renewable Energy and Grid Integration**
- **Net Metering and Hydropower**: State agencies are now participating in net metering, allowing taxpayers to benefit from local hydroelectric projects. Small hydro facilities face financial and regulatory challenges, but Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) and the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) provide critical revenue.
- **ISO New England’s Role**: ISO New England manages the regional grid, highlighting the growing impact of solar energy and the need for flexible resources to balance renewables. The interconnection queue is dominated by battery storage, wind, and solar projects.
- **Grid Reliability**: Concerns were raised about the aging fossil fuel and nuclear fleet, with New England shifting to a winter-peaking system due to electrification. The ISO emphasized the need for dispatchable resources like natural gas and nuclear to ensure reliability.

#### **4. Utility Operations and Infrastructure**
- **Storm Response and Customer Service**: Utilities like Eversource and Unitil discussed improvements in outage response times and grid resilience. The frequency and severity of storms have increased customer expectations for faster restoration.
- **Rate Setting and Costs**: The process of setting utility rates balances infrastructure investments with affordability. Discussions included the breakdown of customer bills into supply, distribution, and transmission charges.
- **Future Energy Needs**: Utilities acknowledged the rise of electric vehicles, rooftop solar, and time-of-use rates, emphasizing the need to adapt infrastructure and rate structures.

---

#### **5. Climate Change and Financial Impacts**
- **House Bill 106 (HB 106)**: The bill proposes establishing a commission to study the financial costs of climate damage in New Hampshire and explore ways to recoup these costs. Testimonies highlighted rising insurance rates, infrastructure damage, and impacts on industries like tourism and agriculture.
- **Support for HB 106**: Proponents argued that climate change is already causing significant economic harm and emphasized the need for proactive measures. Examples included increased flooding, wildfires, and shorter sugaring seasons.
- **Opposition to HB 106**: Critics questioned the scientific basis for attributing specific damages to climate change and raised concerns about the economic burden on fossil fuel-dependent industries.

---

#### **6. Emerging Contaminants and Environmental Protection**
- **PFAS Regulation**: New Hampshire has established groundwater quality standards for PFAS and is monitoring emissions from industrial sources. The state is evaluating the need for air emission rulemaking related to PFAS.
- **Biosolids Management**: The Department of Environmental Services (DES) is addressing the challenges of biosolids management, including land application and transportation costs, in collaboration with the EPA and other states.

---

#### **7. Funding and Budget Challenges**
- **ARPA Funds**: DES has used ARPA funds for dam rehabilitation and drinking water projects, but with ARPA funding ending, the department faces potential budget reductions.
- **Federal Grants**: Federal grants from the bipartisan infrastructure law have supported fish passage and dam safety improvements, but these cover only a third of project costs, with the remainder coming from private sources.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexity of addressing New Hampshire’s energy, infrastructure, and environmental challenges. Key takeaways include the need for sustainable funding for dam maintenance, innovative solutions for integrating renewables into the grid, and proactive measures to mitigate the financial and environmental impacts of climate change. The discussions highlighted the importance of balancing economic growth with environmental protection and the critical role of state policies, regional coordination, and public engagement in shaping New Hampshire’s energy future.
