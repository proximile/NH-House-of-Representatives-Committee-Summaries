The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Science, Technology, and Energy Committee meeting on January 28, 2025, covered a wide range of topics related to energy policy, telecommunications, utility regulation, affordable housing, and clean energy financing. Hereâ€™s a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

### Energy Policy and Resource Selection
1. **House Bill 504**:
   - The bill aims to revise the state's energy policy to emphasize affordability, reliability, and security of energy resources, while limiting government intervention in resource selection and promoting market-driven solutions.
   - Supporters argue it ensures cheap, reliable energy and grid reliability without over-reliance on government subsidies.
   - Critics, including environmental groups, contend it favors fossil fuels over cleaner energy sources, undermines fuel diversity, and fails to address health and environmental impacts.
   - The Department of Energy (DOE) is neutral but noted the bill provides clearer policy direction than existing statutes.

2. **House Bill 189**:
   - This bill defines clean energy and updates the state's energy strategy. An amendment to include low greenhouse gas-emitting sources was adopted, and the bill passed 11-7.

### Utility Regulation and Telecommunications
1. **House Bill 535**:
   - The bill seeks to redefine the role of the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) and address ambiguities in the regulatory process following the creation of the DOE in 2021.
   - Key issues include transferring investigative authority from the PUC to the DOE, the presumption that settlement agreements must be approved by the PUC, and concerns about increased costs and inefficiencies.
   - The bill sparked significant debate over the balance of authority between the PUC and DOE, with further discussion and potential amendments needed.

2. **House Bill 508**:
   - Proposes reducing the assessment rate for telecommunications companies from 33% to 10% of gross utility revenue, arguing the current rate is disproportionate to services received from the PUC.
   - Savings from the reduced assessment could be redirected toward expanding broadband infrastructure, particularly in rural areas.

### Affordable Housing
1. **House Bill 45Z**:
   - Aims to improve affordable housing by addressing lending and capital issues for housing developers, particularly for multifamily units with five or more properties.
   - The bill includes safeguards to prevent abuses seen in past programs and aims to facilitate additional capital for housing projects.

### Clean Energy Financing
1. **House Bill 450 (C-PACER)**:
   - The bill creates a voluntary financing program for commercial, industrial, and multifamily residential property owners to fund energy efficiency, renewable energy, and resiliency upgrades.
   - Payments are made through property tax assessments, ensuring the debt stays with the property even if ownership changes.
   - The New Hampshire Business Finance Authority (BFA) is proposed as the central administrator to streamline the program and reduce the burden on municipalities.
   - The bill has bipartisan support and addresses market failures in energy efficiency investments, making energy upgrades more accessible.

### General Themes
- **Balancing Affordability, Reliability, and Environmental Considerations**: Discussions emphasized the need to balance these factors in energy policy, with particular focus on the role of renewable energy and infrastructure improvements.
- **Regulatory Efficiency and Clarity**: There was a recurring theme of the need for clearer legislative direction to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of utility regulation in New Hampshire.
- **Market-Driven Solutions vs. Government Intervention**: Many bills aimed to promote market-driven solutions while reducing government intervention, though this approach was debated in terms of its impact on clean energy and environmental goals.

### Conclusion
The meeting highlighted the complexities of addressing energy policy, utility regulation, and clean energy financing in New Hampshire. While there was bipartisan support for certain initiatives, significant debates arose over the balance of authority between regulatory bodies, the role of market-driven solutions, and the prioritization of clean energy versus fossil fuels. Further discussions and potential amendments were deemed necessary to address these issues comprehensively.
