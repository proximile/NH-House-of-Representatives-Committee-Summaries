**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting: Municipal and County Government Committee (January 13, 2025)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Municipal and County Government Committee convened on January 13, 2025, to discuss a range of bills addressing municipal and county government issues. The meeting included public hearings, committee discussions, and administrative planning, with a focus on fairness, efficiency, and local control. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics and discussions from the meeting:

---

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

1. **House Bill 84 - Taxing Unregistered RVs in Campgrounds**  
   - **Current System**: Unregistered RVs in campgrounds are treated as real estate, subject to property taxes. However, the administrative burden of assessing and collecting these taxes often outweighs the revenue generated.  
   - **Proposed Change**: The bill would allow municipalities to replace property taxes with a fixed annual fee (up to $200) for unregistered RVs, simplifying the process and reducing disputes.  
   - **Support**: Representative Fogner, the bill’s sponsor, highlighted the inefficiencies in the current system, particularly for municipalities like Swansea.  
   - **Opposition**: Jeremy Sprint of the New Hampshire Campground Owners Association raised concerns about unclear language, potential liability for campground owners, and lack of stakeholder consultation.

2. **House Bill 86 - Increasing Costs for Unlicensed Dog Notices**  
   - **Issue**: Municipalities currently subsidize the cost of certified mail notices for unlicensed dogs, which is financially burdensome.  
   - **Proposed Change**: The bill would increase the cost of these notices to match current postal rates, shifting the financial burden to dog owners who fail to license their pets.  
   - **Support**: Town clerks from Laconia, Derry, and Kingston testified in favor, citing inefficiencies in the current system.

3. **House Bill 92 - Separation of Planning and Zoning Boards**  
   - **Issue**: Individuals serving simultaneously on planning and zoning boards may create conflicts of interest or bias in land use decisions.  
   - **Proposed Change**: The bill would prevent overlapping roles to ensure fair appeals processes and impartial decision-making.

4. **House Bill 99 - Property Tax Waivers for Disabled Veterans**  
   - **Proposed Change**: The bill would allow municipalities to offer a 100% property tax waiver for veterans with 100% service-connected disabilities, up from the current $700 limit.  
   - **Nature of the Bill**: As enabling legislation, municipalities can choose whether to adopt it.

5. **House Bill 101 - Property Tax Exemption for Elderly Homeowners**  
   - **Proposed Change**: The bill would exempt up to $530,000 of assessed property value for homeowners aged 72+ who have been NH residents for at least 10 years and owned their property for 2+ years.  
   - **Rationale**: Aimed at helping elderly residents stay in their homes amid rising property taxes and inflation.  
   - **Concerns**:  
     - Potential tax burden shift to younger residents or non-exempt property owners.  
     - Lack of means testing, allowing high-net-worth individuals to benefit.  
     - Ambiguities in definitions (e.g., “residence” and “homeowner”) and reporting requirements.  
   - **Opposition**: The NH Municipal Association opposed the bill, citing implementation challenges and potential tax shifts.

6. **House Bill 78 - Clarifying Residency Requirements for County Commissioners**  
   - **Issue**: A Strafford County commissioner was elected from a district they no longer reside in, highlighting a loophole in current law.  
   - **Proposed Change**: The bill would clarify that commissioners must be domiciled in the district they represent.  
   - **Amendment**: Senator Gray proposed an amendment to further define domicile requirements and address vacancy procedures.  
   - **Concerns**: Former Rockingham County Commissioner Brian Chiarchiaro raised issues with the phrase “at the time of his election,” suggesting it could allow unethical representation.

7. **House Bill 110 - Revolving Funds for Law Enforcement Special Details**  
   - **Proposed Change**: The bill would allow counties to establish revolving funds for special details or private services performed by law enforcement, reducing the need for large budget appropriations.  
   - **Rationale**: Aimed at streamlining expenses and saving taxpayer money.  
   - **Concerns**: Questions were raised about the mechanics of fund withdrawals and potential transfers to other accounts.

Throughout the meeting, several recurring themes emerged:
- **Fairness and Equity**: Many bills aimed to address disparities, such as tax exemptions for disabled veterans and elderly homeowners. However, concerns about tax burden shifts and unintended consequences were raised.

- **Local Control**: Enabling legislation, such as HB 99, emphasized the importance of allowing municipalities to make decisions based on local needs.
