**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting: House Resources, Recreation and Development (01/22/2025)**  

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 22, 2025, focused on several bills addressing water quality, environmental protection, recreational access, and boating regulations. The discussions highlighted the complexities of balancing regulatory compliance, cost-effectiveness, and stakeholder interests. Here’s a detailed summary of the key topics and bills covered:  

---

### **Water Quality and Water Districts**  

**House Bill 449 (Water Districts and Drinking Water Standards)**  
- **Purpose**: The bill proposes shifting the responsibility for addressing water quality issues from water districts to individual institutions, such as schools, and suggests providing residential customers with water filtration systems as an alternative to costly infrastructure upgrades.  
- **Key Points**:  
  - In cases like the Epsom water district, which faces a $6 million cost to address PFAS contamination, the bill would require the district to provide individual home filtration systems.  
  - Concerns were raised about long-term maintenance, enforcement, and the water district’s continued responsibility for water quality.  
  - Testimony from Brandon Kernan, administrator of the Drinking Water and Groundwater Bureau, highlighted that the bill conflicts with federal Safe Drinking Water Act requirements, which mandate strict water quality standards and certified operators.  
  - Point-of-use filters, while allowed under federal law, require rigorous compliance, making them impractical for large systems.

### **Environmental Protection and Lake Management**  

**House Bill 332 (Cyanobacteria Blooms and Village Districts)**  
- **Purpose**: Introduced by Representative Rosemary Rung, the bill empowers local communities to form village districts to address cyanobacteria blooms in New Hampshire lakes.  
- **Key Points**:  
  - Village districts would allow residents to establish protective ordinances, raise funds for lake treatment, and collaborate across municipalities, as many lakes span multiple towns.  
  - Supporters emphasized the need for local solutions to water quality issues, while opponents raised concerns about taxation and potential overreach.  

**House Bill 334 (Comprehensive Development Plan)**  
- **Purpose**: This bill updates the state’s comprehensive development plan to include environmental needs and threats, particularly related to water resources.  
- **Key Points**:  
  - Supporters argued that proactive environmental planning is essential for protecting New Hampshire’s natural resources, which are vital to the state’s economy and tourism.  
  - The bill received bipartisan support and had previously passed the committee in an earlier session.  

**House Bill 422 FN (Shoreline Water Quality Protection Act Fines)**  
- **Purpose**: The bill seeks to increase the maximum fine for violating the Shoreline Water Quality Protection Act from $5,000 to $15,000 to serve as a stronger deterrent.  
- **Key Points**:  
  - Organizations like the Lake Sunapee Protective Association and New Hampshire Lakes supported the bill, arguing that the current fine is often seen as a “cost of doing business” rather than a penalty.  
  - Some representatives questioned whether the increased penalty would lead to more enforcement, given the infrequency of fines.

### **Recreational Access and Snowmobile Trails**  

**House Bill 513 (Snowmobile Trail Connectors)**  
- **Purpose**: The bill aims to resolve a 14-year-old blockage in an east-to-west snowmobile trail connector, primarily on an interstate right-of-way.  
- **Key Points**:  
  - The Sutton Ridge Runners snowmobile club has been working to address the issue, and the New Hampshire Snowmobile Association (NHSA) supports the bill.  
  - The Department of Transportation (DOT) raised safety concerns, including fencing, lighting, and maintenance, which would be addressed in collaboration with the Department of Natural and Cultural Resources (DNCR) and snowmobile clubs.  
  - Representatives discussed potential amendments to streamline the permitting process for trail connectors without requiring extensive paperwork or measurements.

### **Boating Regulations**  

**House Bill 393 FN (Mooring Regulations)**  
- **Purpose**: The bill seeks to regulate the use of spuds and lifts in lieu of permitted moorings, particularly targeting their use on sandbars or for extended periods without occupancy.  
- **Key Points**:  
  - Marine construction industry representatives requested an exemption for spuds used in their work, as they are essential for operations like excavation and crane work.  
  - Fishermen raised concerns about the bill potentially impacting their use of spuds for anchoring during fishing activities.  
  - Homeowners expressed frustration over neighbors using boat lifts and sea legs to park boats seasonally without proper mooring permits, leading to overcrowding and safety concerns.  
  - Proposed amendments included exempting marine construction and clarifying language to ensure the bill doesn’t affect fishermen or day-use anchoring.

### **Key Themes and Conclusions**  
1. **Regulation and Enforcement**: Bills like HB 393 and HB 422 focus on strengthening regulations and enforcement mechanisms to address environmental and safety concerns.  
2. **Cost and Affordability**: HB 449 and discussions around water quality issues highlight the financial challenges faced by small water districts and the need for cost-effective solutions.  
3. **Local Control and Collaboration**: Bills like HB 332 emphasize the importance of local control and collaboration across municipalities to address environmental issues like cyanobacteria blooms.  
4. **Stakeholder Input**: The discussions underscored the importance of considering the needs of various stakeholders, including marine construction workers, fishermen, homeowners, and water district customers.  

The meeting concluded with plans for further review and potential amendments in executive sessions, reflecting the committee’s commitment to balancing regulatory goals with practical and financial considerations for affected communities and industries.
