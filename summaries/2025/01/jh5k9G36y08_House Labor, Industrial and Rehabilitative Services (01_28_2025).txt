The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 28, 2025, focused on several labor-related bills and issues, including workers' compensation, workplace safety, union recertification, and support for first responders. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

### **Workers' Compensation and Attorney Representation**
- **House Bill 299**: Introduced by Representative Steve Pearson, the bill seeks to reimburse attorney's fees and costs for workers who successfully litigate their workers' compensation claims at the initial hearing stage, rather than only at the appeals stage. 
  - **Support**: Brian Will, president of the Professional Firefighters of New Hampshire, argued that the bill would deter frivolous denials by insurance companies and reduce the financial burden on injured workers, particularly first responders.
  - **Opposition**: George Russos, representing insurance associations, contended that the current system is fair and efficient, warning that earlier reimbursement of legal fees would increase costs for employers and complicate the process.
  - **Broader Implications**: Supporters emphasized the emotional and financial toll on workers fighting denied claims, while opponents highlighted concerns about rising insurance premiums.

### **First Responders and Critical Injury Benefits**
- **HB 282**: This bill proposes increasing the maximum benefits for critically injured first responders from $500,000 to $1 million, funded by the state’s general fund rather than local insurance premiums.
  - **Support**: Testimonies highlighted the evolving risks faced by first responders and the need for enhanced compensation and mental health support, particularly in small communities with limited resources.
  - **Challenges**: Concerns were raised about the financial feasibility of a proposed $150,000 appropriation for an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) for volunteer first responders, given the potential demand.

### **Occupational Safety Standards for Public Sector Workers**
- **House Bill 303**: This bill aims to align New Hampshire’s safety standards for public sector workers with OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) standards, addressing gaps in protections for public employees.
  - **Purpose**: The bill was inspired by tragic incidents, including the death of Tom Wooten, a Northfield public works employee, and seeks to ensure safety standards are "at least as effective" as OSHA regulations.
  - **Bipartisan Support**: The bill received bipartisan backing, with emphasis on the importance of workplace safety.
  - **Concerns**: Opponents raised issues about the financial burden on local governments and municipalities, particularly for upgrading older facilities to meet new standards.
  - **Implementation**: The Department of Labor (DOL) would develop and implement the standards over three to four years, with annual reviews and updates.

### **Union Recertification and Labor Relations**
- **House Bill 735**: This bill proposes mandatory recertification of public sector unions based on a majority of the entire bargaining unit, rather than just those who vote, or on a time-based schedule (e.g., every 5 or 10 years).
  - **Proponents**: Supporters, including Americans for Prosperity, argued that the bill ensures unions remain accountable to their members, similar to political elections.
  - **Opponents**: Representatives from unions, such as the AFL-CIO and the Professional Firefighters of New Hampshire, criticized the bill as unnecessary, anti-worker, and a bureaucratic burden that disrupts labor-management relations.
  - **Existing Processes**: The Public Employee Labor Relations Board (PELRB) already oversees union certifications and decertifications, with employees able to initiate decertification with 30% support.
  - **Concerns**: Opponents highlighted potential administrative chaos, increased costs, and the bill’s potential to undermine collective bargaining.

### **Other Bills and Discussions**
- **HB 238**: The committee passed a bill prohibiting collective bargaining agreements from requiring employees to join or contribute to a labor union, sparking a heated debate over workers’ rights and union strength.
- **HB 69 and HB 353**: These bills, related to employment verification and hearing protection for nightclub employees, were deemed inexpedient to legislate.
- **HB 1228**: A bill related to unemployment system reforms was retained for further study.

### **Key Themes**
- **Workers' Rights and Protections**: The meeting underscored efforts to improve workers' compensation, enhance workplace safety, and support first responders, particularly in small communities.
- **Union Accountability vs. Labor Relations**: Debates over union recertification and collective bargaining highlighted tensions between ensuring union accountability and maintaining harmonious labor-management relations.
- **Financial and Practical Considerations**: Many discussions centered on balancing the need for worker protections with the financial and logistical challenges of implementing new regulations and programs.

### **Next Steps**
The committee will continue deliberations on several bills, including HB 735, with further hearings and executive sessions planned. The discussions reflected a commitment to addressing labor issues while considering the practical implications for workers, employers, and the state.
