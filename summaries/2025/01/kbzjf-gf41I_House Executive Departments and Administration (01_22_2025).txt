**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting on January 22, 2025**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 22, 2025, centered on critical discussions related to energy codes, building regulations, workers' compensation, and administrative updates. The session highlighted a mix of contentious debates, collaborative amendments, and forward-looking policies aimed at improving energy efficiency, housing affordability, and public welfare. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics and outcomes:

---

### **1. Debate Over the 2021 Energy Code**
The adoption of the 2021 energy code emerged as a central issue, with strong arguments both for and against its implementation.

#### **Arguments Against Adoption:**
- **Cost Concerns**: Matt Mayberry, CEO of the New Hampshire Home Builders Association, argued that the code would impose significant financial burdens, estimating $76 million in consumer debt and making homes less affordable for middle- and low-income families.
- **Impact on Housing Affordability**: Opponents warned that higher construction costs could exacerbate the affordable housing crisis and deter new housing developments.
- **Process Concerns**: Stakeholders, including Alex Katris from the Associated General Contractors of New Hampshire, noted that the Building Code Review Board and committee had previously voted against the code, urging a comprehensive review before adoption.

#### **Arguments in Favor of Adoption:**
- **Energy Efficiency and Cost Savings**: Supporters like Bruce Buttrick and Paul Beamus highlighted the long-term benefits, including lower utility bills, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and a quick payback period for upgrades (estimated at $2,300 per home with annual savings of $531).
- **Health and Comfort**: Advocates emphasized improved insulation, vapor barriers, and indoor air quality, which contribute to healthier living conditions and better resilience during extreme weather events.
- **Long-Term Benefits**: Energy-efficient buildings were described as more durable, easier to maintain, and better equipped to handle power outages or fuel shortages.

#### **Additional Points:**
- **Geothermal Heat Pumps**: Discussions included the feasibility and cost of geothermal heat pumps, which were mentioned in the context of the 2024 energy code.
- **Carbon Pricing and Energy Market Trends**: Some speakers linked the debate to broader energy market changes, such as rising costs and potential carbon pricing.
- **Subcommittee Review**: The committee deferred the decision, sending the issue to a subcommittee for further analysis and stakeholder input.

### **2. Ground Source Heat Pumps and Energy Efficiency**
The meeting also explored the role of ground source heat pumps and updates to energy codes:
- **Ground Source Heat Pumps**: The technology was explained as an efficient heating solution that extracts heat from the earth, though it involves higher upfront costs due to drilling requirements.
- **2021 vs. 2024 Energy Codes**: While the 2021 code was recommended for immediate adoption, the 2024 code was discussed as a future consideration.
- **Vapor Barriers and Building Efficiency**: Proper placement of vapor barriers was emphasized to prevent mold and structural issues, alongside the importance of building commissioning to ensure energy efficiency standards.
- **Affordable Housing and Efficiency**: Smaller or multi-family units were noted as more energy-efficient due to reduced surface area-to-volume ratios, addressing concerns about affordability.

---

### **3. Building Code Legislation and Municipal Authority**
Several bills related to building codes and municipal authority were discussed:
- **House Bill 428**: This bill seeks to eliminate municipalities' authority to amend the State Building Code, raising concerns about inconsistencies and enforcement issues. Stakeholders recommended amendments to make the bill workable, and it was sent to a subcommittee for further review.
- **House Bill 244**: Aimed at consolidating enforcement provisions for building and fire codes, this bill received support but was also recommended for subcommittee review to ensure clarity and avoid unintended policy changes.
- **House Bill 96**: This bill mandates the use of the 2021 Energy Building Codes or equivalent standards, with proponents citing benefits like economic growth, job creation, and building resilience. Concerns about construction costs and affordability led to discussions about referencing the 2024 edition of the International Energy Conservation Code instead.
- **House Bill 134**: This bill updates the state building code to adopt the 2023 National Electrical Code, supported by electricians and the Building Code Review Board.

---

### **4. Workers' Compensation and Administrative Updates**
The meeting also addressed administrative and public welfare issues:
- **House Bill 216**: This bill seeks to remove limitations in workers' compensation for severely injured workers, allowing more than one year of service credit toward retirement. Supporters argued it impacts a small number of workers, while fiscal concerns were raised.
- **House Bill 885**: This bill allows student respiratory therapists to work under supervision, supported by the hospital association with no opposition.
- **House Bill 267**: This bill permits animal chiropractors to practice without a veterinarian referral, correcting a language defect from a previous vetoed version.

---

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
The meeting underscored several recurring themes:
- **Balancing Efficiency and Affordability**: Discussions consistently highlighted the need to balance energy efficiency and building resilience with concerns about housing affordability and construction costs.
- **Subcommittee Reviews**: Many bills, including those related to energy codes and municipal authority, were sent to subcommittees for further refinement and stakeholder input.
- **Consistency and Transparency**: Representatives emphasized the importance of maintaining consistency with national standards and ensuring transparency in municipal amendments to building codes.
- **Long-Term Benefits vs. Short-Term Costs**: Advocates for updated energy codes and building standards focused on long-term savings, health benefits, and environmental sustainability, while opponents stressed the immediate financial burdens on homeowners and builders.

### **Conclusion**
The January 22, 2025, meeting of the New Hampshire House of Representatives reflected a robust dialogue on critical issues affecting energy efficiency, housing affordability, and administrative governance. While significant progress was made in advancing several bills, many issues were deferred to subcommittees for further analysis, ensuring thoughtful and inclusive decision-making. The outcomes of these discussions will have far-reaching implications for the stateâ€™s energy policies, building standards, and public welfare initiatives.
