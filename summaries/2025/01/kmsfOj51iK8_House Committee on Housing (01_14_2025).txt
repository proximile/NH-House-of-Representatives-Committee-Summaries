**Summary of the New Hampshire House Committee on Housing Meeting (01/14/2025)**

On January 14, 2025, the New Hampshire House Committee on Housing convened its inaugural meeting, chaired by Representative Joe Alexander, to address the state's pressing housing crisis. The committee, composed of 10 Republicans and 8 Democrats, including Vice Chair Brian Cole and Clerk Sher Reinford, began with the Pledge of Allegiance and introductions. Housing affordability and availability were identified as the top issues for voters, with the committee emphasizing bipartisan collaboration to tackle challenges such as landlord-tenant rights, zoning, and planning.

**Key Discussions and Presentations:**

1. **Zoning and Development Reforms**:
   - The committee explored the impact of new zoning ordinances aimed at increasing housing supply, including shorter setbacks, higher density allowances, and fewer single-family-only zones. These reforms are designed to facilitate the construction of affordable housing, including Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs), and reduce parking restrictions. Examples from other cities and Europe were cited to illustrate the potential benefits of such changes.

2. **State Funding and Subsidies**:
   - There was a strong call for increased state funding, particularly through the low-income housing tax credit program, to support affordable housing projects. The committee also stressed the importance of streamlining the permitting process to reduce delays and uncertainty for developers.

3. **Short-Term Rentals and Second Homes**:
   - The potential impact of short-term rentals (e.g., Airbnb) and second homes on housing availability, especially in the North Country, was debated. While the correlation between these factors and housing shortages was not universally agreed upon, concerns were raised about their effect on local housing markets.

4. **Organizations and Resources**:
   - The New Hampshire Home Builders and the Housing Stability Council were highlighted as key organizations working to address housing challenges. These groups engage in both development and policy advocacy to promote solutions.

5. **Permitting Reforms**:
   - The committee emphasized the need for state-level permitting reforms to provide more predictability and reduce red tape. Suggestions included setting specific timelines for permit approvals and addressing inspection backlogs by allowing certified professionals to assist in the process.

6. **New Hampshire Housing Finance**:
   - Representatives from New Hampshire Housing Finance provided an overview of their initiatives, including managing multifamily housing, homeownership programs, and supportive housing. They highlighted the importance of state funding, such as the affordable housing trust fund, in leveraging federal resources to build and preserve affordable housing.

7. **Public Housing and Vouchers**:
   - The committee discussed the challenges facing public housing and housing choice vouchers, including long waiting lists and insufficient funding to meet the needs of low-income residents, particularly seniors and individuals with disabilities.

8. **Research and Local Solutions**:
   - New Hampshire Housing Finance shared insights from their research on housing needs and local solutions, including the Housing Opportunity Planning (HOP) grants program, which helps communities assess housing needs and revise zoning ordinances to increase supply.

**Commissioner Caswell's Presentation**:
   - Commissioner Caswell from the New Hampshire Department of Business and Economic Affairs discussed the state's housing challenges and initiatives. He highlighted the **InvestNH** program, which allocated $100 million in federal funds to address affordable housing, resulting in over 5,000 new units. He also introduced the **Housing Champions** program, which provides grants to municipalities for housing infrastructure.

**Developer Chris Schiller's Testimony**:
   - Housing developer Chris Schiller provided a detailed overview of the crisis, noting:
     - The median home price in New Hampshire is $520,000, double the national average.
     - Rental rates have increased by 30% in recent years, with the median rent for a two-bedroom apartment now at $1,850.
     - Vacancy rates are extremely low (2% in his portfolio), and homelessness is rising sharply.
     - The state needs **30,000 housing units immediately** and **90,000 over the next decade** to stabilize the market.
     - Challenges include restrictive zoning, rising construction costs, and resistance to affordable housing developments.

**Committee Procedures and Member Introductions**:
   - Chair Alexander outlined the committee's rules, emphasizing respectful discourse, fair questioning of witnesses, and the importance of executive sessions for decision-making. Members introduced themselves, sharing their professional backgrounds and personal motivations for addressing the housing crisis.

**Conclusion**:
   The meeting concluded with plans for upcoming public hearings and discussions on specific housing-related bills. The committee underscored its commitment to addressing New Hampshire's housing crisis through policy reforms, funding initiatives, and data-driven, collaborative solutions. Both immediate and long-term housing needs were highlighted as critical priorities for the committeeâ€™s work.
