### **2. Higher Education and Workforce Development**
The meeting featured presentations from **Chancellor Katherine Prenter** of the University System of New Hampshire (USNH) and **Chancellor Mark Rubinstein** of the Community College System of New Hampshire (CCSNH), focusing on the role of higher education in workforce development and economic growth.

#### **University System of New Hampshire (USNH):**
- **Overview**: USNH includes UNH, Plymouth State, and Keene State, contributing $3.7 billion annually to the state’s economy. Research activity has grown by 75% since 2019.
- **Enrollment and Affordability**: Enrollment has declined by 13% since 2019, but New Hampshire student numbers increased slightly in 2024 due to flat in-state tuition and expanded financial aid. The system received $95 million in state support for FY25, with $81 million directly reducing in-state tuition.
- **Workforce Challenges**: Prenter emphasized workforce shortages in trades, healthcare, and advanced manufacturing, noting that housing, childcare, and education are top concerns for businesses.

#### **Community College System of New Hampshire (CCSNH):**
- **Overview**: CCSNH serves over 24,000 students annually, including 10,000 high school students earning college credits through early college programs.
- **Early College Programs**: Supported by $2.5 million in state funding, these programs allow high school students to earn college credits at a low cost, expanding access to higher education.
- **Workforce Training**: CCSNH collaborates with employers to offer workforce training and apprenticeships, addressing immediate industry needs.

#### **Shared Goals and Challenges:**
- **Pathways and Partnerships**: Both systems are working to create seamless transfer pathways from community colleges to universities, with over 100 transfer pathways established. Partnerships with employers ensure alignment with workforce needs.
- **Challenges**: Declining high school graduation rates and demographic shifts pose challenges, but both systems are focusing on innovation, accessibility, and affordability to attract and retain students.

### **3. Key Strategies and Initiatives**
The meeting outlined several strategies to enhance education funding and student success:
- **Credit Transfer and Affordability**: Efforts are underway to ensure no loss of credit during transfers, reduce delays and costs for students, and promote early college programs to minimize debt.
- **Data Utilization**: The Department of Education has used individual student IDs for nearly 20 years to track students from high school to higher education, though full utilization of this data remains unclear.
- **State Funding and Budgets**: The community college system relies heavily on state funding, with recent budgets around $120 million, including contributions from House Bills 1 and 2, tuition, and grants.
- **Administrative Efficiency**: Both systems are exploring ways to manage administrative costs while providing extensive advising to support diverse educational pathways.
- **Healthcare Programs**: Accreditation standards for healthcare programs, such as nursing and dental hygiene, require small class sizes and close supervision, making them expensive but essential.
- **ERP System Transition**: The university system is transitioning to a new ERP system, while the community college system is assessing the feasibility and costs of a similar transition.
- **Single Accreditation**: A report on single accreditation for the community college system is expected soon, with ongoing discussions about the best path forward.
