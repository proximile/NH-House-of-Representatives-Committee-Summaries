### Comprehensive Summary: New Hampshire House of Representatives Meeting on Education Funding (January 28, 2025)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on January 28, 2025, to discuss several key education funding bills aimed at improving equity, transparency, and access to resources for students across the state. The meeting focused on addressing disparities in education funding, streamlining access to school meals, and enhancing early college and career readiness programs. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and proposals from the meeting:

---

#### **1. House Bill 651: Modifying Education Funding to Address Equity and Adequacy**
**Purpose**: HB 651 seeks to revise the state’s education funding formula by increasing the base cost of an adequate education and introducing equity components to address the needs of underserved student populations, including low-income students, English language learners (ELLs), and students in special education. The bill responds to the **ConVal lawsuit**, which challenged the adequacy of the state’s education funding system.

**Key Provisions**:
- Increases the base cost of an adequate education from $4,100 to $7,351 per student.
- Enhances differentiated aid for students with additional needs, such as low-income, ELL, and special education students.
- Shifts more of the funding burden to the state, reducing reliance on local property taxes, which currently account for 70% of education funding.
- Raises state education funding by approximately $576 million, increasing the state’s share to 45-50% of total education spending.
- Impacts charter schools and the Education Freedom Account (EFA) program, as their funding is tied to the base adequacy grant.

**Testimony and Discussion**:
- **Representative Dave Luno** emphasized the bill’s focus on equity and fairness for students and taxpayers.
- **Zach Shen** (NH School Funding Fairness Project) highlighted the disparities in tax rates and funding across districts due to reliance on local property taxes.
