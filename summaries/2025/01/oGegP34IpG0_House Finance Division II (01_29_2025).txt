### **Department of Safety Budget and Operations**
The Department of Safety, comprising seven divisions, requested a budget of $265 million for fiscal year 2026 and $273 million for fiscal year 2027. The majority of the budget is allocated to salaries and benefits for 1,151 full-time classified positions and 14 unclassified roles. Key divisions include the Office of the Commissioner, Division of Administration, Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), Division of State Police, Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management, Division of Emergency Services and Communications, and the Division of Fire Safety and Emergency Medical Services.

- **DMV**: Focused on road safety through credentialing drivers and vehicles, the DMV is primarily self-funded through cost collections, with a budget request of $34.3 million for fiscal year 2026.
- **State Police**: The division faces staffing shortages, with $2.7 million allocated for body camera contracts and $2.1 million for overtime costs.
- **Emergency Services**: The 911 system is funded through a surcharge on phone bills, with discussions about whether other entities benefiting from the system should contribute.

### **Emergency Services and Fire Fund**
The meeting emphasized the financial needs of the 911 system and the fire fund, which requires a $4 million transfer to maintain services. Representatives explored revenue sources for the fire fund and questioned the adequacy of current funding. Discussions also addressed the challenges of hiring and retaining law enforcement personnel and the balance between public safety and revenue generation from fines.

### **New Hampshire Fish and Game Department**
The Fish and Game Department, led by Executive Director Stephanie Simi, presented its budget and challenges. The department relies heavily on hunting and fishing license sales (70% of revenue) and federal grants but faces a $4 million annual deficit due to rising costs and increasing demands on natural resources.

- **Challenges**: Declining species, habitat changes, climate resilience, and diseases like chronic wasting disease.
- **Initiatives**: Successful programs include the voluntary Hike Safe program, which has exceeded revenue expectations, and efforts to modernize IT infrastructure.
- **Search and Rescue**: Primarily funded through the Hike Safe program, though indirect costs remain underfunded.

### **Transportation Funding and Infrastructure**
The stateâ€™s transportation system faces significant financial challenges, with heavy reliance on federal funding for highway projects. Key points include:

- **Highway Fund**: Structural deficits due to rising operational and maintenance costs, exacerbated by inflation and declining gas tax revenue as fuel efficiency improves and electric vehicle adoption grows.
- **Turnpike System**: Toll revenue is restricted to turnpike maintenance, with discussions about potential toll increases to fund capital projects.
- **Electric Vehicles**: A premium registration fee for electric vehicles and hybrids has generated revenue, but long-term solutions are needed to address declining highway fund revenue.
- **Coastal Resilience**: Recent severe weather has caused significant damage to coastal infrastructure, requiring unbudgeted repairs and federal emergency relief funds.

### **Workforce Shortages and Operational Challenges**
The New Hampshire Department of Transportation (NHDOT) faces chronic workforce shortages, particularly in engineering and highway maintenance positions. Post-COVID workforce dynamics and wage competitiveness have further strained hiring efforts.

- **Project Development**: The department leverages federal funds to support operational needs and minimize the impact on the highway fund, including through indirect cost reimbursements and toll credits for federal matching requirements.
- **Aeronautics, Rail, and Transit**: The state administers FAA block grants for 12 federally funded airports and supports 11 local transit systems, with discussions about increasing state support for transit match requirements.
