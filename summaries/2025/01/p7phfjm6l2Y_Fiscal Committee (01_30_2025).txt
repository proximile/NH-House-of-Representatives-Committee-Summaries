**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Fiscal Committee Meeting – January 30, 2025**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Fiscal Committee convened on January 30, 2025, addressing a wide range of topics, including organizational matters, departmental updates, and audits of state agencies. The meeting highlighted both progress and ongoing challenges in state operations, with a particular focus on the Department of Information Technology (DoIT), the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), and the Department of Transportation (DOT).

### Committee Organization and Procedures
The meeting began with the election of officers, with Senator Jim Gray elected as vice chair and Representative F as clerk. The committee adopted its rules and procedures for the biennium, including an amendment to automatically release audits ahead of time for public and constituent review. The minutes from the previous meeting were approved, and the consent calendar, which included bills and items removed or withdrawn by various departments, was reviewed.

### Department of Information Technology (DoIT) Audit
A significant portion of the meeting was dedicated to the findings and recommendations from a performance audit of DoIT. The audit identified several longstanding weaknesses, including insufficient controls over cost allocation, accounts payable policies, activity code assignment, segregation of duties, telecommunications revenue processing, and payroll monitoring. Many of these issues, which date back to audits from 2006 and 2018, remain unresolved.

Key concerns included:
- **Cost Allocation Issues**: DoIT’s inability to fully recalculate cost allocations, particularly in the CAP 95 system, raised questions about the fairness of charges to state agencies.
- **Recommendations**: The audit suggested improvements in documentation, policy implementation, and process transparency, including monthly reconciliations, formal risk assessments, and better segregation of duties.
- **Legislative Action**: Some findings required legislative changes, such as clarifying unclassified position titles and ensuring compliance with statutes.

DoIT Commissioner Dennis Goulet acknowledged the issues and outlined steps being taken to address them, including the implementation of a new cost allocation system (CAP Plus) and efforts to improve policy documentation. Committee members expressed frustration over the long-standing unresolved issues and stressed the need for timely action and better tracking of audit recommendations.

### Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)
The committee discussed several issues related to DHHS, including:
- **Newborn Screening Program**: Operates on an opt-out basis, with ongoing discussions about its effectiveness and outreach.
- **Sununu Youth Development Center**: The low census at the center and the potential financial impact of claims related to it were highlighted.
- **Telework Policies**: The potential impact of telework policies on DHHS operations was also discussed.

### Department of Transportation (DOT)
The committee addressed winter maintenance funding, with DOT officials indicating that additional requests for funds might be necessary depending on winter conditions.

### Judicial Council and Office of Legislative Budget Assistant
The committee approved items related to the Judicial Council and discussed the need for potential legislative action to address the financial impact of claims related to the Sununu Youth Development Center.

### Audits
Several audits were presented and discussed:
- **Turnpike System**: KPMG presented a clean audit report, confirming compliance with financial reporting and bond covenants.
- **Lottery Commission**: The LBA presented a clean audit report, highlighting significant revenue growth and efficient financial management.
- **DoIT**: The LBA identified 14 issues in its audit of DoIT’s internal controls over revenues and expenditures, recommending improvements to ensure compliance with state law and better oversight.

### Youth Development Center Claims
The committee discussed the ongoing claims process related to the Sununu Youth Development Center, noting the significant financial exposure and the need for efficient resolution.

### Conclusion
The meeting concluded with the committee scheduling its next meeting for February 21, 2025, and addressing logistical challenges due to overlapping commitments of members. Overall, the meeting underscored the importance of addressing long-standing issues, particularly within DoIT, and highlighted the need for both departmental and legislative action to ensure efficient and transparent state operations.
