### **4. Legislative Debates**
The meeting featured robust discussions on two key bills:
- **HB 55: Repeal of the Selective Service Compliance Act**: This bill seeks to remove state-level penalties for failing to register for the Selective Service. Supporters argued the draft is outdated and infringes on individual freedoms, while opponents emphasized its role as a contingency for national defense.
- **HB 104: Defend the Guard Act**: This bill aims to prevent the National Guard from being deployed to foreign combat zones without a formal declaration of war by Congress. Proponents argued it restores constitutional checks and balances, while opponents warned of potential federal funding losses and operational challenges.

### **5. Constitutional and Historical Context**
Throughout the meeting, representatives and speakers referenced constitutional principles and historical events to frame their arguments:
- **Constitutional Concerns**: Discussions emphasized Congress’s war-declaring authority under Article 1, Section 8, and criticized the use of Authorizations for Use of Military Force (AUMFs) as circumventing constitutional requirements.
- **Historical Precedents**: References to the Vietnam War, the Gulf of Tonkin incident, and President Eisenhower’s warning about the military-industrial complex highlighted the need for transparency and accountability in military decisions.

### **8. Fiscal and Political Implications**
The financial impact of legislative proposals was a recurring theme. Opponents of the Defend the Guard Act warned of potential federal funding losses, while supporters argued that upholding constitutional principles outweighed fiscal risks. The fiscal note for HB 104, estimated at $55 million, was debated, with some representatives calling it exaggerated.

### **9. Setting a National Precedent**
New Hampshire aims to lead by example in passing the Defend the Guard Act, hoping to inspire other states to adopt similar legislation and create a unified front against federal overreach.
