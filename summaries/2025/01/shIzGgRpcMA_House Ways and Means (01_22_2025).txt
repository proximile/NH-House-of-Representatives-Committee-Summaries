**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Meeting (House Ways and Means Committee, January 22, 2025)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on January 22, 2025, centered around critical discussions on **tobacco and e-cigarette taxation**, **education funding**, **property tax relief**, and **charitable gaming oversight**. The session highlighted the complexities of balancing public health, economic considerations, and fiscal responsibility through proposed legislation and policy reforms.

### **House Bill 290: Tobacco and E-Cigarette Tax Increase**
The committee extensively debated **House Bill 290**, which proposes increasing taxes on cigarettes, e-cigarettes, and other nicotine products. Key points included:

1. **Public Health and Revenue Goals**: Representative Jerry Stringham, the bill’s sponsor, emphasized the dual objectives of improving public health and generating revenue. New Hampshire’s cigarette tax ($1.78 per pack) is the lowest in New England and has not been adjusted since 2013. The bill proposes a $1 increase to $2.78 per pack, which would still leave the state with one of the lowest rates in the region. Higher taxes are expected to reduce smoking and vaping, particularly among youth and low-income populations, while generating an estimated $87.5 million from tobacco stamps and $3 million from e-cigarettes.

2. **Support and Opposition**: Proponents, including the **American Heart Association** and the **American Cancer Society**, highlighted the public health benefits and revenue potential. Opponents, particularly from the convenience store and vaping industries, argued that the tax increase would harm businesses, reduce cross-border sales, and drive consumers to the black market. Concerns were also raised about the lack of effective enforcement mechanisms for vaping taxes.

3. **Economic and Competitive Concerns**: Opponents warned that higher taxes could erode New Hampshire’s competitive advantage, driving consumers to neighboring states with lower taxes and potentially reducing overall revenue. Historical context was provided, noting that the tobacco tax has not been raised since 2008 and e-cigarette taxes were introduced in 2020.

### **Education Funding and Property Tax Relief**
The committee also addressed **House Bill 318** and **House Bill 255**, which aim to increase education funding and provide property tax relief:

1. **House Bill 318**: Introduced by Representative Tom Shamburg, this bill proposes increasing the percentage of revenue from the **Business Enterprise Tax (BET)** deposited into the **Education Trust Fund**, generating an estimated $226 million. However, it falls short of fully addressing the **Statewide Education Property Tax (SWEPT)** issue, which shifts education costs to local property taxpayers.

2. **House Bill 255**: This bill seeks to increase funding for the education trust fund by reallocating a portion of the **Business Profits Tax**, generating an estimated $18 million. The goal is to provide property tax relief for homeowners and businesses while addressing the **Claremont decisions**, which mandate adequate state funding for public education.

3. **Funding Challenges**: Discussions highlighted the difficulty of balancing education funding with property tax relief and other state priorities. Representatives pointed out 118 unfunded state mandates on education, complicating local budget management. Proposals included school consolidation in rural areas and finding cost-saving measures within the education system.

### **House Bill 328: Charitable Gaming Oversight**
The committee discussed **House Bill 328**, which proposes reauthorizing a **Charitable Gaming Oversight Commission** for a 10-year period:

1. **Commission Responsibilities**: The commission would oversee the implementation of charitable gaming laws, address problem gambling, restructure fund allocation systems, and prevent the over-concentration of gaming locations. It would consist of 9 voting legislative members and 6 non-voting external stakeholders.

2. **Problem Gambling Concerns**: Representatives raised concerns about the lack of guardrails for gambling machines and the need for interventions to address problem gambling, similar to measures in Massachusetts. The commission would also examine the selection process for charities receiving funds to ensure fair and equitable distribution.

### **Key Themes and Challenges**
Throughout the meeting, several overarching themes emerged:

1. **Balancing Public Health and Economic Impact**: The debate over tobacco and e-cigarette taxes highlighted the tension between public health goals and economic considerations, particularly for small businesses and cross-border sales.

2. **Education Funding and Property Tax Relief**: Representatives emphasized the need for innovative solutions to address education funding shortfalls and reduce property taxes, while ensuring fiscal responsibility and avoiding new deficits.

3. **Structural Reforms**: Discussions underscored the importance of structural changes in the state budget, including reallocating existing revenue streams and identifying cost-saving measures.

4. **Bipartisan Cooperation**: The meeting highlighted the need for bipartisan collaboration to address complex issues like education funding, property tax relief, and charitable gaming oversight.

Overall, the session reflected the challenges of crafting policies that balance public health, economic competitiveness, and fiscal responsibility, while addressing the needs of New Hampshire’s residents and businesses.
