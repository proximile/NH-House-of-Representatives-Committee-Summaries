**Summary of the NH House of Representatives Finance Committee Meeting on January 16, 2025**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Committee meeting on January 16, 2025, focused on the state’s budget process, procedural preparations, and committee orientation. The discussions highlighted the complexity of budget planning, revenue challenges, and the collaborative efforts required between the governor, House, Senate, and state agencies to finalize a balanced budget. Here’s a comprehensive summary of the meeting:

---

### **Key Budget Discussions**

1. **Budget Targets and Reductions**:  
   The governor’s office is targeting an overall 4% reduction in agency budget requests for Fiscal Year 2025. Agencies are working on additional reductions to present a balanced budget by the February 15 deadline. The fiscal committee oversees transfers between class lines and approves additional funds, such as competitive grants, that agencies may receive after the budget is passed.

2. **Revenue Concerns**:  
   The state is approximately $50 million under revenue projections through December 2024. March and April are critical months for revenue performance, and the Ways and Means Committee will provide updated revenue estimates. Agencies are hesitant to provide solid estimates until they collaborate with the governor’s office.

3. **Budget Timeline**:  
   The governor’s budget phase is ongoing, with the House set to work on the budget from February to April. The process is tight, with about six weeks to finalize the budget, including public hearings and presentations to the Full House. The Senate will then work on their portion until June, followed by potential concurrence or non-concurrence between the House and Senate.

4. **Double Counting and Transfers**:  
   The budget includes double counting, particularly with transfers between agencies, such as the Department of Information Technology (DoIT). The total budget is approximately $14.5 billion after accounting for these transfers.

5. **Federal Funds and Grants**:  
   Federal funds, including ARPA and CARES Act funds, make up a significant portion of the budget. These are one-time expenses outside the regular budget process, and the fiscal committee tracks them to ensure proper use.

6. **Surplus Statements and Financial Reports**:  
   The state provides surplus statements and comprehensive financial reports, including a 10-year history of fund balances and employee data. The release of the audited financial report has been delayed due to a transition in the liquor division’s accounting system.

7. **Legislative Process and Amendments**:  
   Major policy changes may be included in House Bill 2 (the trailer bill) to avoid killing individual bills. The Legislative Budget Assistant (LBA) plays a crucial role in drafting amendments, coordinating between the House and Senate, and providing financial analysis.

   - The process involves analyzing agency requests, reviewing fiscal notes, and ensuring a balanced budget.

   Each division will handle specific areas of the budget, with analysts assisting in reviewing agency requests and preparing recommendations for the full committee.
