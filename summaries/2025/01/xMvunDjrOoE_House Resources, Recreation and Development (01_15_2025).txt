The January 15, 2025, meeting of the New Hampshire House of Representatives' **Resources, Recreation, and Development Committee** focused on several key bills related to off-highway recreational vehicles (OHRVs), trail management, and public safety. The discussions highlighted the interplay between economic development, environmental conservation, and recreational interests, particularly in the North Country. Here’s a comprehensive summary of the key topics and debates:

---

### **House Bill 127: Extending the ATV Trail Season**
- **Purpose:** The bill proposes extending the **ATV trail season** on the **Connecticut Lakes Headwaters property** in Pittsburgh, NH, from **September 30th to Columbus Day** (an additional 8-13 days).
- **Arguments in Favor:**
  - **Economic Impact:** Supporters argued that extending the season would provide a significant economic boost to the North Country, particularly Pittsburgh, which serves as a hub for ATV tourism. The ATV industry generates **$460 million annually** in NH, and extending the season by two weekends could bring in **$9 million per weekend** in economic activity.
  - **Trail Connectivity:** Extending the season would prevent Pittsburgh from being "landlocked," allowing ATV riders to access over **700 miles of trails** in the region.
  - **Climate Change:** With reduced reliable snow for snowmobiling due to climate change, ATV tourism has become increasingly important for the region’s economy.
- **Opposition Concerns:**
  - **Hunting Conflicts:** The **Fish and Game Department** and the **Headwaters Advisory Committee** raised concerns about conflicts with **bird hunting season**, which begins on September 30th.
  - **Conservation Easement:** The **Connecticut Lakes Headwaters property** is governed by a **conservation easement** that prioritizes non-motorized recreation. Opponents argued that the bill circumvents the established **public process** for managing trail use.
  - **Law Enforcement:** While the **Coos County Sheriff’s Department** agreed to handle enforcement, concerns about limited resources and safety during the overlap with hunting season were raised.
- **Outcome:** The debate reflected tensions between **economic development** and **conservation priorities**, with no immediate decision made.

### **House Bill 174: Increasing the Weight Limit for UTVs**
- **Purpose:** The bill proposes increasing the weight limit for **Utility Task Vehicles (UTVs)** on state-owned trails from **2,100 pounds to 3,500 pounds** to accommodate heavier, more advanced vehicles, including electric models.
- **Arguments in Favor:**
  - **Technological Advancements:** Modern UTVs, especially electric models, are heavier due to features like air conditioning and larger batteries. The increased weight limit would allow these vehicles to operate legally.
  - **Economic Impact:** UTV recreation is a significant economic driver in rural areas like Coos County, and the change could encourage more tourism and participation.
  - **Compliance:** Many UTVs are already overweight due to accessories, and raising the limit would bring them into compliance.
- **Concerns:**
  - **Trail Degradation:** Opponents, including landowners and environmental advocates, worry that heavier vehicles will accelerate trail erosion and increase maintenance costs.
  - **Private Landowners:** Approximately 80% of trails in NH are on private land, and critics argue that landowners have not been adequately consulted about the potential impact.
  - **Enforcement:** There is no clear mechanism to enforce the weight limit, as law enforcement does not carry scales to weigh vehicles.
  - **Infrastructure Strain:** Heavier vehicles could strain existing trail infrastructure, particularly bridges.
- **Outcome:** The debate highlighted the need to balance recreational vehicle use with trail integrity and landowner concerns, with suggestions to involve the **OHRV Study Commission** in further review.

### **House Bill 1113: OHRV Use on State Highways in Windsor**
- **Purpose:** The bill proposes allowing OHRVs to operate on a small section of state highway within the town of **Windsor**, enabling local residents to traverse the road legally.
- **Arguments in Favor:**
  - **Local Mobility:** The bill addresses a specific issue where residents are currently unable to legally traverse the only paved road in Windsor.
  - **Limited Scope:** The bill is not intended to create a trail system or attract tourism but to allow local residents to move freely within their community.
- **Opposition Concerns:**
  - **Noise and Safety:** Residents raised concerns about noise, safety, and the lack of law enforcement in Windsor.
  - **Public Process:** Critics argued that the bill bypasses the public process required for opening roads to OHRVs.
  - **Community Impact:** Some residents highlighted the negative impacts of OHRVs on communities, including noise and disturbances.
- **Outcome:** The discussion emphasized the need to balance local OHRV use with community concerns, with no immediate decision made.

### **House Bill 203: Mandating PFDs During Cold Water Season**
- **Purpose:** The bill mandates the use of **Coast Guard-approved personal flotation devices (PFDs)** for kayaking, canoeing, and rowing sculls between **November 15th and May 15th** to address the dangers of cold water immersion and hypothermia.
- **Arguments in Favor:**
  - **Safety:** Over 83% of drowning victims in paddlecraft accidents were not wearing life jackets. The bill aims to reduce fatalities during the extended boating season.
  - **Hypothermia Prevention:** Cold water immersion can lead to rapid hypothermia, and PFDs are critical for survival.
- **Opposition Concerns:**
  - **Personal Responsibility:** Some argued that the bill contradicts New Hampshire's "Live Free or Die" spirit, emphasizing personal responsibility over government mandates.
- **Outcome:** The hearing concluded with committee members asking questions about the bill’s scope and functionality, with no immediate decision made.

2. **Balancing Interests:** The discussions highlighted the need to balance the interests of OHRV users, hunters, landowners, conservationists, and public safety advocates.
3. **Collaboration:** Stakeholders emphasized the importance of collaboration between OHRV clubs, landowners, state agencies, and local communities to ensure sustainable trail use and address concerns.
4. **Public Process:** Several bills raised concerns about bypassing established public processes for decision-making, particularly regarding conservation easements and trail management.
