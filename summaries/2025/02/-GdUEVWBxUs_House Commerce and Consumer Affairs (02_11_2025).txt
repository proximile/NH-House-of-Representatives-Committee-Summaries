**Summary of the NH House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Meeting on February 11, 2025**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee convened on February 11, 2025, to address a range of legislative issues, including cryptocurrency mining regulations, cannabis legalization, and paint recycling programs. The discussions highlighted the committee’s efforts to balance economic development, environmental sustainability, and community concerns.

### **1. Cryptocurrency Mining and Noise Ordinances**
A significant portion of the meeting focused on legislation addressing cryptocurrency mining, particularly its impact on noise ordinances and zoning regulations. Key points included:
- **Noise Concerns**: Members debated the noise generated by cooling systems (chillers) used in cryptocurrency mining and whether local noise ordinances should apply. Some argued for state-level guidelines to prevent municipalities from unfairly targeting mining operations.
- **Zoning Issues**: Concerns were raised about the placement of mining operations in residential areas, especially in densely populated apartment buildings. The committee discussed whether mining should be restricted to industrial zones or allowed in residential areas with noise mitigation measures.
- **Proposed Legislation**: The bill aimed to ensure fair treatment of cryptocurrency mining under local noise ordinances while preventing municipalities from unfairly shutting down operations. The Municipal Association provided input, and members debated whether the proposed language adequately addressed potential issues.
- **Future Considerations**: Some members cautioned against legislating for hypothetical future problems, while others emphasized the need for proactive guidelines to prevent conflicts.
- **State Investments**: There was brief discussion about the state treasurer potentially considering cryptocurrency as part of the state’s investment portfolio.

### **2. Cannabis Legalization and Regulation**
The committee also debated a bill proposing the legalization and regulation of cannabis. Key points included:
- **Revenue and Budget Concerns**: While members acknowledged the state’s budget deficit and the potential revenue from cannabis legalization, concerns were raised about the initial $7 million cost over the first two years before revenue could be realized.
- **Regulatory Framework**: The bill proposed creating a new Cannabis Commission separate from the Liquor Commission. Some members argued for leveraging the Liquor Commission’s existing infrastructure to avoid additional bureaucracy.
- **Opposition and Support**: Opposition stemmed from concerns about the governor’s and law enforcement’s stance against legalization, while supporters cited public demand and financial benefits.
- **Political Strategy**: Members debated whether to push for immediate action or delay the bill until closer to the next election to improve its chances of passing in the Senate and being signed by the governor.
- **Licensing and Enforcement**: The bill included provisions for licensing cannabis businesses, with discussions on preventing monopolies and ensuring enforcement against sales to minors.

### **3. Paint Recycling and Waste Management**
The committee discussed House Bill 451, which focuses on paint recycling and waste management. Key points included:
- **Funding Mechanism**: Members debated whether the cost of the recycling program should be built into the wholesale price of paint (similar to a VAT) or listed as a separate fee. The beer tax model was cited as an analogy.
- **Antitrust Concerns**: It was clarified that the program would not violate antitrust laws, as the cost would be a business expense rather than a coordinated price increase.
- **Transparency**: Some members preferred transparency in the fee structure, while others supported a market-driven approach where manufacturers voluntarily fund the program.
- **Program Operation**: Jeremy Jones of the American Coatings Association explained the program’s operation, likening it to the beer tax model, where costs are passed through the supply chain.
- **Legislative Details**: Specific sections of the bill were reviewed to clarify funding and operational mechanisms.

### **4. Universal Waste Designation for Oil-Based Paint**
The committee also discussed a bill to classify oil-based paint as universal waste, simplifying regulations for businesses collecting and recycling paint. Key points included:
- **Universal Waste Designation**: The bill would allow retailers to handle oil-based paint without becoming hazardous waste generators, provided they follow basic safety protocols.
- **Liability Waiver**: Businesses participating in the paint stewardship program would be exempt from liability for incidental spills if proper procedures were followed.
- **Fee Structure**: The committee preferred removing explicit fee language from the bill, opting for a market-driven approach.
- **Transparency and Oversight**: Members debated whether consumers should be informed about the fee, ultimately leaning toward market regulation.
- **Program Success**: The program, already operational in 13 states, has successfully diverted millions of gallons of paint from landfills, offering significant environmental benefits.
- **Licensing and Transportation**: The need for licensed hazardous waste transporters to handle collected paint was emphasized.
- **Fiscal Impact**: The state would incur minimal costs, reimbursed by the PaintCare program, to oversee the initiative.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the committee’s efforts to address complex issues at the intersection of commerce, consumer protection, and environmental sustainability. Discussions on cryptocurrency mining, cannabis legalization, and paint recycling reflected a focus on balancing economic opportunities with community and environmental concerns. While some bills faced skepticism and political challenges, the committee worked to refine legislation to ensure fairness, transparency, and efficiency.
