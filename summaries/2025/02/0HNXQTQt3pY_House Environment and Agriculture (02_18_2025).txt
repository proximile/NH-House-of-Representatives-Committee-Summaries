### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee Meeting (February 18, 2025)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Environment and Agriculture Committee convened on February 18, 2025, to discuss a wide range of bills and amendments related to environmental protection, agriculture, food safety, and animal welfare. The meeting highlighted the committee’s efforts to balance regulatory oversight with support for small-scale producers, local food systems, and public health. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes from the meeting:

---

### **Environmental and Landfill Regulations**
1. **Solid Waste Site Evaluation Committee**: The committee reviewed proposed legislation to establish a solid waste site evaluation committee as part of the HB2 trailer bill. Members were tasked with providing input to the Finance Committee, emphasizing the need for detailed plans for landfill projects, including leachate management and third-party assessments of public benefits and harms.
   
2. **Landfill Setbacks and Permitting**: Several bills addressed landfill regulations:
   - **HB77 and HB2115** focused on landfill setbacks and permit application requirements, with amendments proposing detailed leachate management plans and contingency measures.
   - **HB171** proposed a moratorium on new landfill permits, with amendments adjusting the moratorium period from five to three years.
   - **HB566** mandated detailed leachate management plans, including on-site treatment and backup contingency plans.

3. **Plastic Waste**: The committee voted to kill **HB479**, which aimed to study plastic waste regulation, arguing that existing solid waste working groups already address the issue.

### **Food Safety and Small-Scale Producers**
1. **Freeze-Dried and Dehydrated Foods**:
   - **HB505**: The committee discussed amending the Homestead Cottage Law to allow the sale of freeze-dried foods, including potentially hazardous items like ice cream, from residential kitchens. Testimonies highlighted the safety and economic benefits of freeze-drying, but the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) expressed concerns about oversight and food safety.
   - **HB642**: Proposed allowing the sale of dehydrated meat without a homestead food license, with provisions for labeling and safety standards. DHHS raised concerns about the lack of inspection and oversight for exempted products.

2. **Meat Processing and Inspection**:
   - **HB396**: Aimed to provide more flexibility in meat inspection regulations for small farms selling directly to consumers. Farmers testified about challenges with USDA-inspected facilities, including overbooking, poor management, and financial losses. The bill sought to allow local custom slaughterhouses to sell meat without USDA inspection, but concerns were raised about conflicts with federal law and food safety.
   - **Prime Act Advocacy**: Several speakers supported the federal Prime Act, which would allow states to regulate meat processing independently of USDA oversight. Representatives discussed drafting a resolution to encourage Congress to pass the act.

3. **Food Safety Amendments**:
   - **HB150**: Clarified that equipment must be "cleaned and sanitized" rather than just "washed and rinsed."
   - **HB307**: Addressed sanitation, handwashing accessibility, and pet exclusion in secondary food production areas.

### **Animal Welfare**
1. **Animal Cruelty Training (HB153)**: The committee discussed requiring law enforcement officers to receive training on animal cruelty statutes. A study committee was proposed to explore the best ways to train officers, prosecutors, and other stakeholders, and to develop a statewide resource for prompt response to animal cruelty cases.

2. **Glue Traps (HB152)**: The committee noted significant public interest in banning glue traps, with over 100 emails received. Concerns were raised about the omission of opposition from the Fish and Game Department and the lack of focus on insect mitigation.

### **Environmental Rights and Clean Air/Water**
1. **Clean Air and Water Resolution (HR10)**: The committee debated a resolution recognizing the right to clean air, water, and a healthy environment. An amendment was proposed, with some members preferring the term "rights" over other phrasing.

### **Local Food Systems and Decentralization**
1. **Support for Small Producers**: Representatives emphasized the benefits of decentralizing food production, supporting local farmers, and reducing food waste. They argued that small-scale producers can offer diverse, high-quality products and foster community trust.
   
2. **Economic and Regulatory Challenges**: Farmers highlighted the financial burden of USDA inspections and the difficulty of competing with larger operations. Concerns were raised about farmers misrepresenting imported meat as locally sourced, undermining trust in local markets.

---

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
1. **Regulatory Balance**: The committee grappled with finding a balance between reducing regulatory burdens for small producers and ensuring public health and safety. Amendments and study committees were proposed to address these concerns.
   
2. **Local Food Systems**: There was strong support for promoting local food systems, decentralizing food production, and increasing consumer access to locally sourced goods. Representatives advocated for measures to empower small farmers and reduce reliance on centralized facilities.

3. **Federal vs. State Regulations**: Several discussions highlighted conflicts between state and federal regulations, particularly in meat processing and food safety. The committee explored ways to advocate for federal reforms while supporting state-level initiatives.

4. **Public Health and Safety**: Food safety remained a central concern, with DHHS and other stakeholders emphasizing the importance of oversight, traceability, and proper handling of potentially hazardous foods.
