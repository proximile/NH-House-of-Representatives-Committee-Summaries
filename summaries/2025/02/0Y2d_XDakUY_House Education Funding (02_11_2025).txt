The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on February 11, 2025, centered on education funding, addressing a wide range of topics including special education costs, school meal programs, and various education-related bills. The discussions emphasized the need for fiscal responsibility, equity, and clarity in education policies while considering the financial and logistical challenges faced by school districts. Here is a comprehensive summary of the key points:

### **Medicaid Direct Certification Program and School Meal Programs**
1. **Medicaid Direct Certification**: The program aims to automatically enroll eligible students in free and reduced-price meal programs using Medicaid data, reducing administrative burdens for families and schools. While the program could increase the number of eligible students and potentially add $50 million to the stateâ€™s adequacy funding by FY 2028, an amendment was proposed to make it budget-neutral by using pre-pandemic enrollment data for funding calculations.
2. **Nutritional Benefits**: School meals are highlighted as more nutritious than typical home-packed lunches, adhering to strict guidelines for calorie, sodium, fat, and nutrient content.
3. **Local District Costs**: While the program benefits families, districts may incur additional costs for preparing and serving more meals, especially if they expand breakfast programs.
4. **Federal Reimbursements**: Higher reimbursement rates for free meals could offset some district costs.
5. **Community Eligibility Provision (CEP)**: Schools with high percentages of low-income students can provide free meals to all students, though local districts must cover the portion not funded by federal dollars.
6. **Unpaid Meal Debt**: A bill (HB 703) was discussed to prohibit schools from shaming students with unpaid meal debt, with an amendment removing the requirement for the Department of Education to pay off meal debt. Concerns were raised about parents who can afford to pay but choose not to.

### **Special Education Funding**
1. **IEP Costs and Reimbursements**: There is significant variation in special education spending across districts, with some spending much more than the state average. The current funding model, which provides more aid to districts that spend more, was criticized for creating backward incentives. Representatives suggested aligning incentives to encourage spending closer to the state average.
2. **Rising Costs**: Special education costs have risen significantly, with the number of students with IEPs increasing from 17% in 2017 to 21.5% in recent years. Maximum costs per student have also surged, with one example reaching $571,000 in FY 2024.
3. **District-Level Variations**: Smaller districts face unique challenges, as they cannot align with state averages due to their circumstances. Larger districts like Manchester and Marac show significant differences in per-student spending.
4. **Reimbursement Process**: The Department of Education reviews invoices to ensure they match IEP services but does not assess cost reasonableness. Concerns were raised about potential overpaying for services.
5. **Out-of-District Placements**: Out-of-state placements for students with severe needs drive up costs, as the state does not set rates for these placements.
6. **Future Considerations**: Proposals included lowering the threshold for state aid and auditing IEPs more thoroughly to ensure cost appropriateness.

### **Education-Related Bills**
1. **HB 747 - Enrichment Scholarships for Gifted Students**: Passed unanimously, this bill establishes a program for gifted students and appropriates funds, with concerns about fiscal impact addressed.
2. **HB 750 - Incentive Grants for School Districts**: Also passed unanimously, this bill proposes incentive grants for districts improving assessment scores, though concerns about timing and budget constraints were raised.
3. **HB 739 - Excess Funds to Municipalities**: This bill reinstates provisions requiring municipalities to remit excess state education property tax payments, addressing constitutional concerns and inconsistencies in tax rates.
4. **HB 729 - Recodification of Education Laws**: Appropriates funds for the Department of Education to recodify outdated, conflicting, and redundant education statutes, emphasizing the need for clarity and consistency.
5. **HB 443 - Commission Appointments**: Amendments clarified the terms and responsibilities of commission members, with a subcommittee formed to review the bill further.
6. **HB 484 - Career and Technical Education (CTE) Space Repurposing**: The bill addresses reallocating CTE classroom space, with an amendment approved to remove restrictions on repurposing.
7. **HB 319 - Transportation and Meals for Kindergarten Pupils**: An amendment removed the meal provision, leaving only the transportation requirement, with debates on the importance of local control versus ensuring access to meals.

### **Key Themes**
- **Fiscal Responsibility**: Representatives emphasized the need for budget-neutral solutions and careful consideration of fiscal impacts.
- **Equity and Consistency**: Discussions highlighted the importance of equitable funding across districts and consistent application of education laws.
- **Local Control vs. State Mandates**: Balancing local control with state mandates was a recurring theme, particularly in discussions about meal programs and special education.
- **Data and Oversight**: The need for better data granularity and oversight was stressed, particularly in understanding special education costs and ensuring efficient use of funds.

Overall, the meeting underscored the complexity of education funding and the need for collaborative, comprehensive approaches to address the challenges faced by students, families, and school districts in New Hampshire.
