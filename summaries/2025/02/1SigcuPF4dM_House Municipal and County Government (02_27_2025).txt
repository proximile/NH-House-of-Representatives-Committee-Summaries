The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened multiple committee meetings between February 27, 2025, and early March 2025, to discuss a series of bills addressing municipal governance, budgeting transparency, tax impacts, wireless infrastructure, and forest management. The discussions centered on enhancing transparency, fiscal responsibility, and local control while balancing state and federal regulations. Below is a cohesive summary of the key bills and debates:

### **Municipal Budgeting and Tax Transparency**
1. **House Bill 284 (HB 284)**:  
   - Requires a tax impact summary on warrant articles to clarify how tax rates will be affected if all articles pass.  
   - Supporters emphasized increased transparency, while opponents raised concerns about practicality and potential confusion if articles fail.  

2. **House Bill 138 (HB 138)**:  
   - Mandates municipalities to provide estimated tax impacts for special warrant articles, including multi-year projections (up to five years).  
   - Supporters argued it helps voters understand long-term financial commitments, such as bonds or leases.  
   - Opponents, including the New Hampshire Municipal Association (NHMA), questioned the feasibility of accurate estimates due to variables like property valuations and bond rates.  

3. **House Bill 475 (HB 475)**:  
   - Proposes reforms to the default budgeting system by eliminating the use of unfilled employee positions to fund other areas of the budget.  
   - Supporters argued it increases transparency and ensures budgets reflect actual needs, while opponents, including school districts, highlighted the need for flexibility in managing unfilled positions.  

4. **House Bill 613 (HB 613)**:  
   - Allows local political subdivisions to adopt a reduced default budget option (1-10%) if the proposed budget fails.  
   - Supporters claimed it provides fiscal flexibility for taxpayers, while opponents warned it could lead to arbitrary cuts and hinder municipal operations.  

### **Local Tax Caps and Budgeting**
1. **House Bill 200 (HB 200)**:  
   - Proposes raising the threshold for overriding local tax caps from a simple majority to a three-fifths supermajority.  
   - Supporters argued it promotes fiscal responsibility, while opponents, including NHMA, claimed it undermines local control and voter authority.  

2. **House Bill 374 (HB 374)**:  
   - A housekeeping bill to clarify issues in the 2024 Senate Bill 383, which established local tax and school district budget caps.  
   - Amendments included shifting the inflation index calculation date to October 1st and adding missing statutory references.  

### **Wireless Infrastructure and 5G Regulation**
1. **House Bill 501 (HB 501)**:  
   - Restores local authority over the installation and regulation of 5G wireless facilities, including small cell antennas and towers.  
   - Supporters cited health and environmental concerns from the New Hampshire 5G Commission Report and emphasized the need for public discourse and permit processes.  
   - Opponents, including the Business and Industry Association (BIA), argued it conflicts with federal telecommunications laws, hinders economic growth, and delays critical infrastructure deployment.  
   - Testimonies highlighted alternatives like small cell canisters and debated the safety of 5G radiation.  

### **Municipal Forest Management and Public Works**
1. **House Bill 124 (HB 124)**:  
   - Allows town forest committees to deposit surplus funds into the general fund, potentially reducing local taxes.  
   - The bill addresses restrictions that prevent towns from using forest revenues for tax relief.  

2. **House Bill 168 (HB 168)**:  
   - Adds Public Works facilities to the list of eligible capital facilities for impact fees, allowing municipalities to recover costs for infrastructure necessitated by growth.  

### **Key Themes**
