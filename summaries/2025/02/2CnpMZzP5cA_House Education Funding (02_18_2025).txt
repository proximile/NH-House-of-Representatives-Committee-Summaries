**Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting: House Education Funding (02/18/2025)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened to address education funding and related legislative bills, beginning with procedural matters before diving into substantive discussions.  

In **Segment 1**, a representative raised a scheduling concern regarding committee reports. Noting the absence of a House session the following week, the representative proposed a deadline of Friday for submitting reports to allow two or three days for processing. The chair agreed to the timeline, and the representative expressed gratitude, concluding the procedural discussion.  

In **Segment 2**, the House focused on several key education-related bills:  

1. **HB 112**: This bill, requiring university and community college students to pass a U.S. citizenship and immigration civics test, was retained in committee after a motion and second, with no further discussion.  

2. **HB 510**: A bill establishing due process rights for students, organizations, and faculty facing disciplinary actions in state higher education institutions was passed over for discussion at a later date.  

3. **HB 659**: A bill establishing a New Hampshire college graduate retention incentive program was indefinitely postponed (ITL) due to its complexity and lack of readiness.  

4. **HB 770**: This bill, which proposed creating a program for tuition credits through community service, was ITL due to budgetary concerns, though representatives commended the student advocates behind the initiative.  

5. **HB 583**: This bill, related to Medicaid direct certification for free and reduced-price school meals, sparked extensive debate. An amendment aimed to make the bill budget-neutral by holding school funding steady for two years. The bill passed with a majority vote, though some representatives opposed it, citing concerns about delaying financial impacts.  

6. **HB 646**: A bill requiring school districts to establish an online application for free and reduced-price meal programs was ITL, with some representatives noting that many districts already offer this without legislation.  

7. **HB 665**: A bill related to eligibility for free school meals was retained in committee for further review.  

8. **HB 703**: This bill, which prohibits schools from denying meals to students with unpaid balances and addresses meal debt, was amended to remove financial obligations from the Department of Education. It passed with a majority vote, though some representatives opposed it, arguing it was unnecessary or overreaching.  

9. **HB 771**: A bill funding open enrollment schools passed with a majority vote, allowing students to attend schools outside their district with funding adjustments.  

10. **HB 718**: This bill, requiring the State Board of Education to report unfunded financial impacts of rules exceeding state or federal standards, passed with a majority vote, though some representatives expressed concerns about potential lowering of standards.  

The meeting concluded with plans to address remaining bills in future sessions, emphasizing the need for attendance and substitutes as necessary. The session highlighted the Houseâ€™s focus on balancing fiscal responsibility with the needs of students and educational institutions, while addressing procedural efficiency in legislative processes.
