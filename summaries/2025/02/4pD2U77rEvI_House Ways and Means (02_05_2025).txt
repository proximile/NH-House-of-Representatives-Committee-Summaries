The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on February 5, 2025, addressed a wide range of legislative issues, focusing on property tax exemptions, state park finances, charitable gaming, immigration-related policies, and the social and economic impacts of casinos. Here’s a comprehensive summary of the key discussions:

### **Property Tax and State Park Finances**
- **HB 650: Dedicated Funds and State Parks**: Introduced by **Dan Maguire**, this bill aims to streamline state finances by cleaning up outdated funds, capping the robotics education fund at $1 million, and separating the Cannon Mountain ski area fund from the general state parks fund for better accounting. The bill was unanimously recommended for the consent calendar.
- **HB 585: Property Tax Exemption for Religious Organizations**: Sponsored by **Representative John Janigian**, this bill addresses challenges faced by small churches and religious organizations. It allows churches to rent out parsonages and worship spaces without losing tax exemptions, provided the income is used for religious purposes, pastor salaries, or maintenance. The bill limits exemptions to one parsonage and one worship building per organization to prevent abuse. **Betty Gay** testified in support, while **Brad Dees** of the Municipal Association raised concerns about expanding tax exemptions and potential inconsistencies with existing laws.
- **HB 688: Property Tax Assessment for Casino Development**: **Representative Bill Ohm** discussed this bill, which focuses on whether property tax assessments should reflect the new use of a former Sears store in Nashua being converted into a casino. The property’s current assessment is $16 million, generating $300,000 in annual taxes, but its value could increase due to its new purpose.

### **Charitable Gaming and Casinos**
- **HB 737: Charitable Gaming and Casino Regulations**: Representatives debated whether towns should opt-in or opt-out of allowing casinos, with a preference for opt-in to give towns more control. Existing casinos and those in the pipeline would be grandfathered in, preventing towns from opting out after establishment. Concerns about traffic and community impact were raised, particularly in Nashua and Littleton, where large casino projects are planned.
- **Impact of Casinos on Communities**: A 20-year study titled "Casinos, Crime, and Community Cost" found that crime initially decreases in the first year after a casino opens but tends to rise in subsequent years, particularly robbery, aggravated assault, and burglary. Municipalities hosting casinos should receive mitigation funds, typically around 3% of gross slot machine revenue, to offset associated costs. A new Enterprise tax was proposed, which would tax casino properties at twice their assessed value, but it faced criticism for being exorbitant and unfair.
- **Local Control and Zoning**: **HB 737** also includes provisions for local control over whether casinos can operate within a municipality, similar to existing local control over other lottery products like Kino.

### **Nonprofit Status and Immigration**
- **HB 635: Nonprofit Status and Immigration**: This bill seeks to revoke the tax-exempt status of nonprofit organizations (NGOs) that assist illegal immigrants, arguing that such activities do not align with public policy goals. The sponsor criticized large NGOs receiving taxpayer funds to resettle immigrants, claiming they create negative externalities. The bill would require organizations to verify the legal status of individuals they assist. Concerns were raised about the bill potentially infringing on religious organizations’ rights and the clarity of its definitions. The Department of Revenue Administration noted that enforcing the bill would require investigating NGOs based on complaints or reports of aiding illegal immigrants. Public testimony highlighted concerns about the financial and social impact of illegal immigration on New Hampshire, while a representative from a refugee resettlement organization defended their work, emphasizing that their services are provided to legal refugees.

### **Scheduling and Decision-Making**
The meeting also addressed scheduling and decision-making regarding upcoming legislative work. The group confirmed a meeting for next Tuesday at 2:00 PM to address four bills, with plans to work on revenue estimates all day Tuesday. A straw poll was suggested to gauge opinions on whether to retain a specific bill or move forward with it as is, with the decision to be finalized at the next meeting.

### **Key Themes**
The discussions highlighted tensions between state statutes, local tax assessments, and federal regulations, particularly regarding tax exemptions for religious and nonprofit organizations. The debates also underscored the balance between economic benefits, community impact, and ethical considerations in policymaking, with a focus on local control, the role of nonprofits, and the state’s priorities in regulating charitable gaming and immigration-related services.
