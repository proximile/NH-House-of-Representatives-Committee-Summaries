**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting on Education Funding (01/31/2025)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened to address critical issues surrounding education funding, with a particular focus on special education. The meeting highlighted the complexities of the current funding system, the challenges faced by districts, and potential solutions to ensure equitable and adequate support for students with disabilities. The discussion was divided into three key segments, each addressing different aspects of the issue.

### **Key Challenges and Data Limitations**
Lawmakers expressed significant concern over the lack of comprehensive data, which hampers their ability to make informed decisions. The state currently only collects detailed information on students whose special education costs exceed the $70,000 cap, leaving a gap in understanding the needs and costs of students below this threshold. This incomplete data makes it difficult to project costs accurately and develop effective funding models. Additionally, the state lacks the capacity to analyze the data it does collect, further complicating efforts to identify trends and cost drivers.

### **Funding Models and Comparisons**
The committee explored various funding models, including comparisons to other states. For example, one state covers special education costs between $15,000 and $65,000, which prompted discussions about transitioning to a similar model in New Hampshire. Historical context was also considered, with reference to a simpler 1985 model that allocated 1.5 times the average cost per special education student. The committee debated whether this approach could be revisited as a more effective alternative.

### **Special Education Aid and Reimbursement**
A significant portion of the meeting focused on the intricacies of special education aid and reimbursement. Aid is only available for costs directly tied to a student’s Individualized Education Program (IEP), excluding expenses for alternative programs or general education. This creates challenges for districts, particularly regarding transportation costs for external providers, which are not reimbursable unless bundled into service rates. The state’s $70,000 cap on special education costs also poses issues, especially when students move between districts mid-year, potentially splitting costs and preventing either district from reaching the cap.

### **Rising Costs and Service Delivery**
The committee noted the increasing costs of special education services, driven by factors such as early identification of disabilities and a growing understanding of conditions like autism. Developmental delay, a category for children under 10, has also seen significant growth due to early intervention efforts. The federal requirement for students to be educated in the least restrictive environment (LRE) was discussed, with some debate about whether this always serves students' educational needs effectively. The committee also explored how services are delivered and funded, including the process for districts to submit invoices for reimbursement.

### **Proposals for Change and Next Steps**
Several proposals were discussed to address the challenges of special education funding. These included lowering the $70,000 cap, reallocating resources to districts with higher needs, and viewing special education funding as an insurance policy with adjustments to co-pays, deductibles, and state-district cost-sharing. The committee emphasized the need for more detailed data to model the financial impact of such changes and ensure equitable funding. The meeting concluded with a commitment to synthesize the discussion, explore additional data, and develop a best-guess projection for costs. Decisions are expected by early March, as the issue is critical to both the general education funding formula and special education funding.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexity of special education funding in New Hampshire and the urgent need for improved data collection and analysis. Lawmakers are committed to developing a more equitable and effective funding model that meets the needs of students with disabilities while balancing state and local financial responsibilities. The next steps involve further exploration of data, refinement of funding proposals, and decisive action by early March.
