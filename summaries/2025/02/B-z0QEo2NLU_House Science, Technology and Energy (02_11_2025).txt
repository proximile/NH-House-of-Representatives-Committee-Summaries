**Summary of the NH House of Representatives Science, Technology, and Energy Committee Meeting (February 11, 2025)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Science, Technology, and Energy Committee convened on February 11, 2025, to discuss several bills and resolutions related to energy, technology, telecommunications, and environmental policy. The meeting addressed a wide range of issues, including advanced nuclear technology, taxation of power generators, geoengineering, and telecommunications. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **Key Topics and Discussions**

#### **1. Telecommunications: Area Code Overlay (HB 708)**
The committee debated the introduction of a second area code for New Hampshire to address the increasing demand for phone numbers. Concerns were raised about the complexity of geographic code splits, but the Department of Energy clarified that area code planning falls under the jurisdiction of the North American Numbering Plan Administrator (NAPA), not the state. The committee voted 14-1 to recommend the bill as "inexpedient to legislate" (ITL).

#### **2. Advanced Nuclear Technology (HCR 2 and HB 710)**
- **HCR 2**: Representative Keith Ammon introduced a resolution supporting advanced nuclear technology, emphasizing its potential for energy independence, economic growth, and carbon-free energy. The resolution urges the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to expedite approval processes for advanced nuclear reactors and highlights the importance of workforce development, including collaboration with state universities and National Labs.
  
- **HB 710**: This bill would allow electric utilities to own and operate advanced nuclear resources, such as micro, mini, or small nuclear reactors (1-90 MW capacity). While proponents argued it positions New Hampshire for future energy needs, critics raised concerns about high costs, potential ratepayer burdens, and the impact on the state’s deregulated energy market. The committee considered amendments to refine definitions and thresholds, with stakeholders advocating for a procurement model rather than direct utility ownership.

---

#### **3. Taxation of Power Generators (HB 696 FN)**
HB 696 FN proposes reclassifying electricity generators as manufacturers rather than utilities, exempting them from the utility property tax (UPT) and including them under the Statewide Education Property Tax (SWEPT). Key points included:
- **Revenue Impact**: The change would reduce UPT revenue by $12.75 million annually but expand the SWEPT tax base, potentially lowering the SWEPT rate for all taxpayers.
- **Pilot Agreements**: Existing Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILOT) agreements would remain in effect until their end date or January 1, 2031.
- **Assessment Disparities**: The bill aims to eliminate dual assessments by the Department of Revenue (DRA) and municipalities, reducing litigation risks.
- **Stakeholder Concerns**: While generators supported the bill, the Municipal Association opposed it, citing the need for access to proprietary financial data for accurate assessments.

---

#### **4. Geoengineering and Weather Modification (HB 764)**
HB 764 seeks to prohibit intentional geoengineering activities, including solar radiation modification (SRM) and stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI), while allowing cloud seeding only in declared catastrophic droughts with oversight by the Department of Environmental Services (DES). Key points included:
- **Repeal of RSA 12-F1**: The bill would repeal the existing statute on weather modification, which testifiers argued lacks public consent and risk-benefit analysis.
- **Health and Environmental Concerns**: Testifiers cited alleged health impacts, such as respiratory issues and soil contamination, and referenced historical government experiments like Operation LAC.
- **Enforcement**: The bill does not include specific penalties, raising questions about enforceability.
- **Public Support**: Significant support was expressed for the bill, with calls for stricter regulations and investigations into geoengineering activities.

---

#### **5. Other Bills and Discussions**
- **HB 723 & HB 681**: Bills related to a data platform were considered for retention to allow more time for cost-benefit analysis.
- **HB 764**: A bill prohibiting intentional emissions, including cloud seeding and electromagnetic radiation, was scheduled for discussion.

---

### **Workforce Development**
Several representatives emphasized the need for a skilled workforce to support advanced nuclear technology, suggesting collaboration with state universities, National Labs, and private industry.

---

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the committee’s focus on balancing innovation, economic growth, and environmental protection. Key outcomes included:
- **ITL Recommendation for HB 708** (Area Code Overlay).
- **Support for HCR 2** (Advanced Nuclear Technology) and ongoing discussions on **HB 710**.
- **Debate on HB 696 FN** (Taxation of Power Generators), with concerns about revenue and assessment disparities.
- **Strong Support for HB 764** (Geoengineering Prohibition), though enforceability remains a concern.

The committee planned further discussions, public hearings, and potential amendments to address stakeholder concerns and refine pending legislation.
