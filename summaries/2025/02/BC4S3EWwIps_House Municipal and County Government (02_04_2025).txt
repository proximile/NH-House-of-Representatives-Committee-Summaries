### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **Property Tax Exemptions for Nonprofits and Religious Organizations**
1. **House Bill 625**: This bill, which would allow municipalities to require nonprofits to pay 25% of the municipal property tax rate, faced strong opposition from nonprofit leaders. Maurice Reese, CEO of the Front Door Agency, argued that the bill would strain organizations providing affordable housing and critical services, potentially forcing them to cut programs. Other nonprofits, including Catholic Charities and the New Hampshire Center for Nonprofits, echoed concerns about the financial burden and the risk of reduced services for vulnerable populations. Proponents, including the New Hampshire Municipal Association, emphasized the bill’s flexibility and the need to alleviate tax burdens on property taxpayers in towns with high concentrations of tax-exempt properties.

2. **House Bill 147**: Sponsored by Representative Mooney, this bill sought to clarify tax exemptions for properties used by religious, educational, and charitable organizations. Supporters, including the Roman Catholic Diocese of Manchester, highlighted challenges posed by ambiguous tax laws, such as the taxation of cemeteries and unused land. Critics, including assessor Jim Misho, raised concerns about potential tax shifts to other taxpayers and the bill’s broad language.

3. **House Bill 426**: This bill, introduced by Representative McDonald, aimed to allow nonprofits to appeal late filings of tax exemption forms due to accident, mistake, or misfortune. Andy Moo of the Wright Museum shared an example of a $50,000 tax penalty resulting from a late filing due to a medical emergency. Critics raised constitutional concerns about retroactive application and its potential to conflict with already set tax rates.

4. **House Bill 425**: Sponsored by Representative Mark Pearson, this bill addressed tax exemptions for properties owned by religious organizations. It clarified that rental income from properties like rectories, when used for clergy housing, should not be taxable, and sought to prevent the taxation of properties used for religious purposes, even if rented out.

#### **Support for Elderly and Vulnerable Populations**
1. **House Bill 766**: This bill proposed an exemption from local education property taxes for elderly residents (70+ years old) who have lived in their homes for 30+ years and have assets under $750,000. Supporters argued it would help seniors remain in their homes, while critics raised concerns about fairness, the potential tax shift to younger residents, and administrative challenges.

2. **House Bill 689**: Sponsored by Representative Hemingway, this bill aimed to incentivize volunteerism by offering a property tax credit (capped at $1,500) to elderly and veteran volunteers. Concerns included the administrative burden of tracking volunteer hours, insurance and liability implications, and the potential for significant tax shifts if many residents qualify.

3. **House Bill 782**: This bill sought to expand property tax exemptions for elderly and disabled individuals and raise awareness about tax credits. Testimony highlighted concerns about tying exemption amounts to automatic CPI adjustments, which could override local voter decisions.

#### **Other Key Bills**
1. **House Bill 421**: Sponsored by Representative Pearson, this bill would require towns to notify tax-exempt organizations of filing deadlines and necessary documents to prevent the revocation of tax-exempt status due to missed deadlines. The bill received mixed feedback, with concerns raised about the administrative burden on municipalities.

2. **House Bill 617**: Introduced by Representative Melissa Lichfield, this bill proposed updating the homestead exemption to reflect current home values, increasing it from $120,000 to between $500,000 and $1 million. The goal was to better protect homeowners from lawsuits amid rising property values.

3. **House Bill 458**: This bill aimed to limit local assistance to U.S. citizens or permanent legal residents, with exceptions for refugees, asylum seekers, and other federally recognized groups. It faced significant opposition, with critics highlighting existing federal restrictions and the need to support vulnerable populations.

Concerns about unintended consequences, such as tax shifts to other taxpayers and administrative burdens, were recurring themes.

2. **Support for Nonprofits and Religious Organizations**: Many bills focused on protecting nonprofits and religious organizations from financial strain, emphasizing their critical role in providing services to communities. However, debates revealed concerns about the potential impact on municipalities’ tax bases.

3. **Administrative Challenges**: Several bills raised questions about the feasibility of implementation, including tracking volunteer hours, verifying eligibility for exemptions, and managing retroactive tax applications.
