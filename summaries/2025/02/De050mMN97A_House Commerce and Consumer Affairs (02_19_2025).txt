**Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee Meeting (February 19, 2025)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee convened on February 19, 2025, to discuss a range of bills addressing consumer protection, healthcare, economic development, and public health. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and outcomes from the meeting:

### **1. Undischarged Mortgages (House Bill 437)**
- **Purpose**: The bill, sponsored by **Representative Bill Boyd**, seeks to streamline the process of reconciling obsolete mortgages by shortening the time it takes for undischarged mortgages to become unenforceable.
- **Key Points**:
  - Currently, New Hampshire has a 50-year statute of limitations for private mortgages, but the law is silent on public mortgages. The proposed bill would void mortgages five years after their expiration date or after 35 years if no expiration date is specified.
  - **Representative Boyd** and co-sponsor **Representative Mary Hacken Phillips** emphasized the inefficiencies and costs of clearing undischarged mortgages through court processes.
  - Stakeholders, including **Michelle R. Coffin** (title insurance underwriter) and **Susan Cole** (New Hampshire Association of Realtors), highlighted the financial burden and delays caused by undischarged mortgages.
  - **Ryan Hill** from the New Hampshire Bankers Association supported the bill, noting it was vetted by the banking industry and has an effective date of January 1, 2028, to allow banks time to update records.

### **2. Gold and Silver as Legal Tender (House Bill 721)**
- **Purpose**: Introduced by **Representative Juliet Harvey-Bolia**, the bill would declare gold and silver as legal tender in New Hampshire, aiming to provide a hedge against inflation and protect against potential future sales taxes on precious metals.
- **Key Points**:
  - Proponents argued that fiat currency undermines the value of money and that gold and silver offer a more stable alternative.
  - Opponents, including the Business and Industry Association and **Sarah Burke Cohen** from the New Hampshire Municipal Association, raised concerns about the practicality of handling gold and silver transactions and the lack of infrastructure to support such a system.

### **3. Paid Family and Medical Leave (PFML) Program (House Bill 517)**
- **Purpose**: **Representative Len Turcot** advocated for the repeal of New Hampshire’s PFML program, arguing it is fiscally irresponsible and primarily benefits state employees at taxpayer expense.
- **Key Points**:
  - Turcot cited low private-sector participation (less than 2.5% of the workforce) as evidence of the program’s failure.
  - Opponents, including the New Hampshire Insurance Department and various stakeholders, defended the program’s voluntary, market-oriented approach, emphasizing its success in providing critical support for families and its role in attracting and retaining talent.
  - The program is administered by MetLife, which bears the financial risk, not the state. Opponents argued that repealing the program would create uncertainty and increase costs for businesses and families.

### **4. Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplemental Plans (House Bills 774 & 706)**
- **Purpose**: These bills address challenges with Medicare Advantage and Medicare supplemental plans (Medigap), including network adequacy, cost, and prior authorization issues.
- **Key Points**:
  - Medicare Advantage plans often have limited networks, high out-of-pocket costs, and frequent denials of care. The bills aim to allow beneficiaries to switch back to traditional Medicare without facing underwriting or high premiums for pre-existing conditions.
  - **House Bill 774** seeks to remove exemptions for Medicare supplemental plans from laws protecting individuals with pre-existing conditions, ensuring community rating for premiums.
  - **House Bill 706** aims to prevent insurers from conducting prepayment audits of mental health providers, which delay payments and threaten the financial stability of small practices.
  - Stakeholders, including the **New Hampshire State Commission on Aging**, supported the bills, emphasizing the need for better public education about Medicare options and protections for older adults.

### **5. Labeling Protection for Biodegradable/Disposable Products (House Bill 556)**
- **Purpose**: The bill, introduced by **Representative Lucius Parshall**, aims to ensure truth in advertising for products labeled as biodegradable or disposable, requiring them to meet certifiable benchmarks before being labeled as compostable.
- **Key Points**:
  - The bill focuses on improving solid waste management and reducing landfill waste, particularly organic waste like food.
  - New Hampshire currently lacks in-state composting facilities, leading to waste being exported to neighboring states.
  - The bill does not impose financial burdens or restrict consumer purchasing habits but seeks to enforce labeling standards based on scientific testing.

### **6. Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) and Public Health Initiatives (House Bill 496)**
- **Purpose**: Introduced by **Representative Drew Klein**, the bill requires New Hampshire state liquor stores to distribute information on identifying signs of AUD and how to seek help.
- **Key Points**:
  - The bill aims to leverage the state liquor stores' frequent contact with at-risk populations to provide resources and promote treatment.
  - New Hampshire has a higher-than-average rate of AUD (12%), with significant societal and economic costs.
  - The bill seeks to solidify and expand previous efforts, including a grant-funded video on AUD displayed in state liquor stores.

### **7. Liquor Regulations and Social Districts (House Bill 467)**
- **Purpose**: Introduced by **Representative Bill Boyd**, the bill allows municipalities to create social districts where people can consume alcohol in designated public areas.
- **Key Points**:
  - The bill is modeled after successful programs in states like North Carolina and Michigan, aiming to boost local economies and revitalize downtown areas.
  - Testimonies highlighted the economic benefits and addressed concerns about public safety and enforcement.
  - Well-regulated social districts in other states have not led to significant increases in crime or public intoxication.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting reflected a broad range of legislative priorities, from consumer protection and healthcare reform to economic development and public health. The discussions highlighted the need for thoughtful consideration of these bills to address the challenges faced by New Hampshire residents while balancing fiscal responsibility, public safety, and economic growth. The committee plans to continue refining these bills in subcommittee meetings, with a focus on ensuring they meet the needs of all stakeholders.
