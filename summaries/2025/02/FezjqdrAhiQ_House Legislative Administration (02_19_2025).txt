The New Hampshire House of Representatives recently held a series of meetings addressing a wide range of legislative bills and issues, reflecting the House's focus on safety, transparency, fiscal responsibility, and public service. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and legislative actions:

---

### **Safety and Security: House Bill 477**
- **Purpose**: Introduced by Representative Laura Tersi (Hillsboro 11), the bill proposes the establishment of a commission to study safety and security procedures in the State House complex. The commission would evaluate current measures, identify gaps, and recommend modern solutions based on best practices from other states.
- **Background**: The bill was inspired by concerns following the 2023 New Hampshire hospital shooting, highlighting the need for proactive safety measures in the State House.
- **Commission Composition**: The 11-member commission would include representatives from various safety and security backgrounds, potentially including the Concord Police Chief.
- **Timeline**: An interim report is due by November 1, 2025, with a final report the following year.
- **Testimony**: Representatives shared personal experiences of security threats, emphasizing the importance of improved safety measures. Concerns about public disclosure of security flaws were addressed, with assurances that sensitive discussions would remain confidential.
- **Current Efforts**: The Joint Legislative Facilities Committee is already addressing security, including ongoing assessments and drills in partnership with Homeland Security.

### **Taxpayer-Funded Lobbying: House Bill 314**
- **Purpose**: Introduced by Representative Kelly Penza (Strafford District 19), the bill seeks to prohibit the use of taxpayer funds for lobbying activities by public entities, arguing that such practices are undemocratic and conflict with taxpayers' interests.
- **Examples**: The New Hampshire Municipal Association (NHMA) and similar organizations were cited as entities that use taxpayer money to lobby, often opposing legislation beneficial to taxpayers (e.g., lower property taxes).
- **Impact**: The bill would not affect other services provided by these organizations, such as legal advice or training, but specifically targets lobbying activities.
- **Testimony**: Supporters argued that taxpayer-funded lobbying creates a conflict of interest, while opponents noted that small towns rely on associations like NHMA for representation on legislative issues.
- **Outcome**: The committee moved to **retain** the bill for further discussion and potential amendments, given its complexity and the concerns raised.

### **Honoring Fallen Service Members: House Bill 142**
- **Purpose**: The bill proposes the adoption of the **Honor and Remember Flag** to honor military personnel who died in service. Families can personalize the flag with the names of their loved ones.
- **Supporting Testimony**: Gold Star family members and Representative Mike Moffett emphasized the flag’s significance in recognizing sacrifices and providing healing for families.
- **Opposition Testimony**: Critics, including Kevin Grady from the State Veterans Advisory Committee, argued that the American flag is sufficient and that the Honor and Remember Flag is unnecessary.
- **Key Concerns**: Opponents raised issues about the flag’s resemblance to the Viet Cong flag, potential logistical challenges, and its relationship to the American flag.
- **Proposed Amendments**: Suggestions included flying the flag on specific days (e.g., Memorial Day) rather than daily and using “may” instead of “shall” to provide flexibility.
- **Historical Context**: The bill has been introduced multiple times over the past 12 years but has consistently been rejected by committees.

### **Fiscal Responsibility and Transparency: House Bills 157 and 331**
#### **House Bill 157**:
- **Purpose**: Establishes a study committee to improve the usefulness of fiscal notes in legislation, ensuring they provide detailed cost-benefit analyses.
- **Key Points**: Fiscal notes currently lack comprehensive economic impact assessments. The committee would review current statutes, guidelines, and House/Senate rules, with a deadline of September 1, 2026, to complete its work.
- **Concerns**: Questions were raised about the Legislative Budget Assistant’s capacity to produce detailed fiscal notes for over 1,000 bills per session.

#### **House Bill 331**:
- **Purpose**: Requires the Secretary of State to publish a public-facing list of where bills are in the legislative process, increasing transparency.
- **Key Points**: The bill aims to make it easier for the public and legislators to track bill progress without needing to contact multiple offices.
- **Concerns**: Opponents raised potential political reasons for delaying bills, but proponents argued that transparency outweighs these concerns.

---

### **Child Care Advisory Council**
- **Purpose**: The council advises on child care issues, meets six times a year, and reports annually to the House Oversight Committee.
- **Concerns**: Discussions included the potential repeal of the council and whether the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) could establish its own commission. Critics argued that such a council might prioritize DHHS agendas over the needs of child care providers.
- **Provider Advocacy**: Child care providers emphasized the importance of having a voice in legislative decisions, particularly regarding licensing regulations and funding allocations.

### **Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF): House Bill 605**
- **Purpose**: Introduced by Representative Ellen Reed, the bill aims to certify New Hampshire legislators for the PSLF program, which forgives federal student loans after 120 on-time payments while employed in public service.
- **Key Points**: Currently, New Hampshire legislators are not certified for PSLF, unlike many other states. The bill seeks to encourage younger, working-class individuals to run for office by providing this benefit.
- **Testimony**: The Clerk of the House and the Department of Labor provided additional information on how other states handle PSLF certification and the enforcement aspects of the bill.

---

### **House Resolution 8 and Other Legislative Actions**
- **House Resolution 8**: Introduced by Representative Len Turcot, the resolution addresses the practice of suspending constitutional officers and questions the authority of the Judiciary in such matters.
- **Non-Germane Amendment**: Representative Turcot introduced an amendment to House Bill 118, which repeals certain committees and commissions, aiming to replace the title and entirety of the bill.

1. **Safety and Security**: Enhanced security measures in the State House are a priority, especially in light of rising threats and political tensions.
2. **Taxpayer-Funded Lobbying**: Ethical and constitutional concerns about using public funds to lobby, particularly when it conflicts with taxpayers' interests.
