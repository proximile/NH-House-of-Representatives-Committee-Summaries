### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Public Works and Highways Committee Meeting (02/04/2025)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Public Works and Highways Committee convened on February 4, 2025, to discuss several key bills and topics, focusing on highway infrastructure, public safety, and community well-being. The meeting addressed the following major issues:

---

#### **1. Mile Markers on Highways**
- **Enhanced Reference Location Signs**: The committee discussed the importance of mile markers on highways, which display the distance from the route’s origin, a route shield, and cardinal direction. These markers are critical for **public safety** (e.g., identifying incident locations), **engineering**, and **maintenance purposes**.
- **Implementation**: New Hampshire has been transitioning to these enhanced signs on interstates and major highways, including I-93, I-393, and NH-101. While the **Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD)** requires mile markers every mile, New Hampshire uses **2/10 of a mile intervals** on interstates for better visibility and accessibility.
- **Costs and Challenges**: The cost of installation was noted as $288,000 for one-mile intervals and $580,000 for 2/10-mile intervals. While the **Federal Highway Administration** supports these markers, funding constraints and potential impacts on **scenic vistas** were acknowledged as drawbacks.

#### **2. House Bill 713: Mile Markers on Route 112 (Kancamagus Highway)**
- **Purpose**: The bill proposes installing mile markers along Route 112, a remote and winding highway with limited cell service, to improve emergency response times.
- **Safety Concerns**: Deputy Police Chief Scott McKinley emphasized the challenges responders face in locating incidents without mile markers, which delays assistance and increases risks. The lack of reference points has been a persistent issue in this area.
- **DOT Perspective**: Lee Bonis, DOT’s Bureau of Traffic administrator, provided technical information about mile markers but did not take a position on the bill.

#### **3. House Bill 578: Sound Barriers Along the F.E. Everett Turnpike**
- **Purpose**: The bill seeks to construct sound barriers along the Everett Turnpike in Merrimack to mitigate noise pollution affecting nearby neighborhoods.
- **Resident Impact**: Testimony from residents, town officials, and legislators highlighted the increased noise levels due to the turnpike’s expansion, which disrupts daily life and reduces quality of life.
- **DOT Criteria**: John Evans, DOT’s noise program manager, explained that sound barriers are only installed where they are deemed feasible and reasonable under federal and state criteria. Currently, only seven of 20 impacted locations qualify for barriers, with a total cost of $19 million. Expanding barriers to all affected areas would require an additional $24 million.
- **Equity Concerns**: Advocates, including Rep. Julie Miles and Merrimack’s town manager Paul McAuliffe, argued that neighboring communities like Bedford have received sound barriers, and Merrimack deserves the same consideration. They questioned the use of pre-COVID standards and the exclusion of certain neighborhoods from noise abatement plans.

#### **4. House Bill 561: Transfer of State-Owned Real Property**
- **Purpose**: The bill aims to protect municipalities from being forced to take responsibility for state-owned highways without their consent. It seeks to amend sections of RSA laws related to the discontinuance, reclassification, and disposal of state-owned highways.
- **Unfunded Mandates**: Sponsored by Representative Nancy Murphy, the bill addresses concerns about unfunded mandates imposed on towns and cities when the state transfers highway maintenance responsibilities to municipalities. Such transfers place a disproportionate financial burden on local taxpayers, especially when the highways are used by people outside the town or city.
- **Constitutional Concerns**: The bill emphasizes that these transfers violate the New Hampshire State Constitution, which prohibits unfunded mandates on local governments. Testimony highlighted specific examples, such as the town of Merrimack, which faces a $500,000 annual cost for maintaining a state highway.

#### **5. House Bill 745: Naming a Bridge in Keene After Charles Redfern**
- **Purpose**: The bill proposes naming a bridge in Keene after **Charles Redfern**, a long-time advocate for the city’s multi-use trail system.
- **Redfern’s Contributions**: Redfern co-founded **Pathways for Keene**, a nonprofit that raised funds for trail projects, and served as a former city councilor. His dedication to Keene’s trail network was widely recognized.
- **Expedited Process**: The bridge, currently unnamed, is a key connector in Keene’s trail system. Redfern’s health issues were cited as a reason to expedite the naming process while he is still alive.
- **Committee Vote**: The committee unanimously voted **15-0** to recommend the bill for passage, with plans to place it on the **consent calendar** for expedited approval.

---

#### **6. Key Themes**
- **Public Safety and Infrastructure**: Discussions on mile markers and Route 112 highlighted the importance of infrastructure improvements for emergency response and safety.
- **Equity and Fairness**: Bills addressing sound barriers and highway transfers emphasized the need for equitable solutions to protect municipalities and residents from undue financial and environmental burdens.
- **Community Advocacy**: The naming of the Keene bridge and the push for sound barriers underscored the role of community advocates in shaping public policy.
