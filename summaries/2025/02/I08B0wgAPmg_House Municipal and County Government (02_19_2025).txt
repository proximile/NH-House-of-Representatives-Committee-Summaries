### Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Discussions on Recovery Housing

The New Hampshire House of Representatives has engaged in detailed discussions surrounding **recovery housing**, focusing on its certification, regulation, and integration into communities. These discussions, centered around **House Bill 432 (HB 432)**, highlight the critical role recovery housing plays in addressing the state’s substance use crisis while addressing challenges related to zoning, safety, and community acceptance. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points and themes from these meetings:

---

### **1. The Need for Recovery Housing in New Hampshire**
- **Substantial Shortfall**: New Hampshire faces a significant shortage of certified recovery housing beds, with only **1,300 available** against an estimated need of **15,000**. This gap underscores the urgency of expanding and regulating recovery housing to meet the state’s public health needs.
- **Public Health Benefits**: Data indicates that neighborhoods with recovery homes experience lower rates of substance use, overdose, and substance-related crime, demonstrating their positive impact on communities.

---

### **2. Definition and Purpose of Recovery Housing**
- **Supportive Environment**: Recovery housing provides a structured, supportive environment for individuals recovering from substance use disorders, helping them reintegrate into society.
- **Non-Transient Use**: Recovery housing is primarily non-transient, with residents typically staying for extended periods (average stay around 250 days). This aligns with the **international residential code definition** of residential use, distinguishing it from transient facilities like boarding or rooming houses.
- **Community Integration**: Recovery homes are designed to operate similarly to single-family homes, integrating seamlessly into neighborhoods.

---

### **3. Certification and Oversight**
- **Certification Requirements**: Recovery homes must be certified by recognized organizations, such as **NH Core**, which sets standards for occupancy, safety, and recovery support. Certification involves **annual inspections** and adherence to specific operational guidelines.
- **Eliminating "Bad Actors"**: Certification helps distinguish legitimate recovery homes from unregulated or poorly managed facilities, ensuring quality and accountability.

---

### **4. Challenges and Regulatory Issues**
- **Zoning and Community Resistance**: Recovery homes often face resistance from communities and zoning boards, particularly in denser areas. The lack of a clear definition of recovery housing in zoning ordinances complicates approval processes.
- **For-Profit vs. Nonprofit Operations**: Both for-profit and nonprofit recovery homes exist, with nonprofits often facing higher operational costs. The discussion emphasized that the tax status of the operator should not affect zoning decisions.
- **Local vs. State Regulation**: Some representatives questioned whether recovery houses should be regulated at the **local level**, arguing for community input. Advocates, however, stressed the need for **state-level regulation** to ensure consistency and address stigma.

---

### **5. Safety and Building Code Considerations**
- **Fire Safety Standards**: The State Fire Marshal, Sean Tumi, testified that certified recovery homes are exempt from **sprinkler system requirements**, provided they meet other safety criteria, such as working smoke alarms, carbon monoxide detectors, and proper egress. Recovery houses are treated similarly to **single-family homes** in terms of fire safety.
- **Annual Fire Inspections**: HB 432 proposes **annual fire inspections** for recovery houses, which is more stringent than typical residential inspections. This measure aims to address concerns about the safety of residents and neighboring properties.

---

### **6. Accessibility and ADA Compliance**
- **Federal Laws and Accommodations**: Questions were raised about whether recovery houses should be **ADA-compliant**. While ADA compliance is not explicitly required, federal laws may necessitate accommodations for individuals with disabilities.

---

### **7. Legislative Support and Public Input**
- **Stakeholder Support**: Organizations like **New Futures** and recovery housing operators strongly support HB 432, arguing that it will provide a clear framework for operation, eliminate "bad actors," and ensure quality standards.
- **Public Input Concerns**: Some representatives raised concerns about the lack of **public input** in the approval process for recovery houses, particularly from neighbors and local residents.

---

### **8. Certification Timeline**
- **Implementation Period**: The bill allows recovery houses **up to a year** to obtain certification, with some discussion about shortening this timeline to **six months** to expedite the process.

---

### **Conclusion**
The discussions surrounding recovery housing in the New Hampshire House of Representatives underscore the importance of HB 432 in addressing the **stigma, safety, and regulatory challenges** associated with recovery homes. The bill aims to provide a clear, consistent framework for their operation while balancing the needs of residents, neighbors, and local communities.

These efforts reflect a **collaborative approach** between state agencies, recovery housing advocates, and local officials to address New Hampshire’s substance use crisis effectively.
