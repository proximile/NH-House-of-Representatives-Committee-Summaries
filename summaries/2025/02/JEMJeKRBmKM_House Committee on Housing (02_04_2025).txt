**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Housing Committee Meeting (02/04/2025)**

The New Hampshire House Committee on Housing convened on February 4, 2025, to address the state's housing crisis through a series of legislative proposals.

Below is a cohesive summary of the discussions and key points from the meeting:

### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **1. HB 459 (Minimum Lot Size Reform)**
- **Objective**: Reduce restrictive minimum lot size requirements to increase housing affordability and supply.
- **Provisions**:
  - Caps minimum lot size at 22,000 square feet (half an acre) for properties with municipal sewer systems, unless larger sizes are justified for public health or safety.
  - For lots without sewer systems, lot sizes must not exceed what is necessary for septic systems.
- **Support**:
  - Advocates, including Representative Joe Alexander, argued that excessive zoning practices ("snob zoning") have priced out working families and essential workers.
  - The New Hampshire Association of Realtors emphasized the need for increased housing density to improve affordability.
- **Concerns**:
  - The New Hampshire Municipal Association (NHMA) opposed the bill, citing concerns about local control and the broad language regarding "unreasonable restrictions."
  - Questions were raised about the impact on rural areas, frontage requirements, and conservation subdivisions.
- **Next Steps**: The committee planned work sessions to refine the bill’s language and address specific concerns.

#### **2. HB 631 (Mixed-Use Development)**
- **Objective**: Allow residential units in commercial zones to increase housing supply and promote walkable communities.
- **Provisions**:
  - Permits multifamily housing in commercial, retail, or office zones.
  - Encourages ground-floor commercial use with residential units above.
- **Support**:
  - Advocates highlighted the benefits of mixed-use development, including economic viability, walkability, and repurposing underutilized commercial spaces.
  - Organizations like the New Hampshire Youth Movement and Housing Action New Hampshire emphasized the need for housing for young and essential workers.
- **Concerns**:
  - Opponents, including Paul Desan from Newington, raised issues about local control and the potential inclusion of industrial zones in the definition of "commercial property."

#### **3. HB 577 (Accessory Dwelling Units - ADUs)**
- **Objective**: Create a uniform framework for ADUs to address the housing shortage.
- **Provisions**:
  - Allows property owners to build one ADU by right (up to 950 square feet), attached or detached.

- **Concerns**:
  - The NHMA opposed the bill, arguing it undermines local governance and could strain infrastructure.
  - Some worried about ADUs being used for short-term rentals (e.g., Airbnb) rather than long-term housing.
- **Next Steps**: The committee considered amendments to balance local control with the need for ADU development.
