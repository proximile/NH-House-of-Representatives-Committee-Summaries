### Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting: House Commerce and Consumer Affairs (02/05/2025)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on February 5, 2025, convened by the House Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee, addressed several critical bills aimed at reforming consumer protection, healthcare, and insurance practices. The discussions highlighted the complexities of balancing consumer needs, industry concerns, and regulatory challenges. Below is a cohesive summary of the key bills and topics discussed:

---

#### **House Bill 725: Ground Ambulance Services and Rental Car Coverage**

**Ground Ambulance Services:**
- **Broken Business Model**: The bill addresses the financial instability of ground ambulance services, with several providers shutting down due to insufficient reimbursements and the prohibition of balance billing. A recent study underscored the challenges, including the reliance on town funding and donations.
- **Balance Billing Prohibition**: The bill extends the prohibition of balance billing to ground ambulances, protecting consumers from financial ruin while proposing a reimbursement rate of 325% of Medicare to stabilize providers.
- **Rural Impact**: The proposed reimbursement rate is seen as crucial for sustaining services in rural areas without significantly increasing insurance premiums.
- **Stakeholder Perspectives**: The bill is supported by the NH Ambulance Association and fire chiefs but opposed by insurers like Anthem, who argue it could disincentivize providers from joining insurance networks.

**Rental Car Coverage:**
- **Purpose**: The bill mandates seven days of rental car coverage for individuals whose vehicles are totaled in accidents where they are not at fault, addressing predatory practices by insurers.
- **Current Rules**: Existing administrative rules require at least five days of rental coverage, but the bill seeks to extend this to seven days.
- **Industry Concerns**: Insurers argue that determining fault can delay coverage, and the bill’s language needs clarification to avoid unintended consequences.
- **Consumer Advocacy**: Supporters emphasize the financial and logistical challenges faced by accident victims, particularly those without rental coverage in their policies.

#### **House Bill 297: Granite State Home Mitigation and Resiliency Program**
- **Program Overview**: The bill establishes a fund to help homeowners make property improvements (e.g., fortifying roofs, addressing flood risks) to reduce insurance premiums. It is modeled after successful programs in states like Alabama and Florida.
- **Funding**: The first $1 million from the state’s insurance premium tax will fund grants of up to $10,000, administered by the NH Insurance Department.
- **Eligibility and Safeguards**: A means test will prioritize applicants, and homeowners must provide proof of completed work to receive funds.
- **Support and Opposition**: Insurers support the program for its potential to reduce claims, but questions were raised about why the industry doesn’t fund such initiatives directly.

#### **House Bill 507: Credentialing of Mental Health Providers**
- **Purpose**: The bill requires health carriers to process credentialing applications for mental health providers within 30 days, addressing workforce shortages in behavioral health.
- **Retroactive Billing**: A contentious provision allows providers to bill for services from the date of their credentialing application submission. Insurers oppose this, citing potential complications with contract negotiations.
- **Support**: Mental health advocates argue that expediting credentialing is critical to addressing the state’s mental health care crisis.

---

#### **House Bill 705: Healthcare Cost Transparency**
- **Purpose**: The bill aims to increase transparency by requiring health carriers to disclose negotiated rates, out-of-network allowed amounts, and historical net prices for prescription drugs.
- **Alignment with Federal Law**: The bill codifies federal transparency regulations (Transparency in Coverage Rule) into state law, with provisions to protect patient privacy by aggregating data.
- **Concerns**: Questions were raised about the bill’s handling of different payment rates and its potential overlap with federal regulations.

---

#### **Healthcare Price Transparency: Standardizing Machine-Readable Files**
- **Federal Regulation**: The bill seeks to standardize the format of machine-readable files that health carriers are required to make publicly available, addressing the current lack of uniformity.
- **Proposed Solution**: The NH Insurance Commissioner would establish a standardized format to improve data usability for consumers, employers, and researchers.
- **Carrier Concerns**: Insurers expressed concerns about the costs and logistical challenges of changing data formats, especially for smaller carriers.
- **Legislative Intent**: The bill aims to enhance transparency without imposing new requirements, ensuring existing data is more accessible and useful.

### Key Themes and Outcomes:
1. **Consumer Protection vs. Industry Concerns**: The discussions highlighted the tension between protecting consumers and addressing practical challenges faced by insurers.
2. **Rural and Vulnerable Populations**: Bills like HB 725 and HB 297 emphasized the importance of supporting rural areas and low-income households.
3. **Transparency and Efficiency**: HB 705 and the machine-readable files bill underscored the need for greater transparency in healthcare costs and insurance practices.
4. **Legislative Process**: The use of non-germane amendments (e.g., HB 297) and subcommittee discussions demonstrated the complexities of refining legislation to address stakeholder concerns.

The committee plans to continue refining these bills, balancing consumer needs with industry realities while ensuring sustainable and equitable solutions.
