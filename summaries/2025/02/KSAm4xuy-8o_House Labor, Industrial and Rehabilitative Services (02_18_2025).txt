### **Key Bills and Amendments**

#### **HB 280: Wage Payment Systems**
- **Amendment and Vote**: An amendment to HB 280 was proposed and passed with a vote of 11-9. Representative Avalani moved to "ought to pass" (OTPA), which was seconded. The bill faced opposition from some representatives who argued it could complicate wage payment systems. Despite the debate, the bill ultimately passed with a vote of 11-9.

#### **HB 379: Labor Regulations**
- **Amendment and Vote**: An amendment to HB 379 failed with a vote of 11-9. Representative Cahill’s motion to retain the bill for further work also failed with the same vote. The bill was then voted on for OTPA, which failed, and a motion to "indefinitely postpone" (ITL) passed with a vote of 11-9.

#### **HB 386: Employment Practices**
- **Amendment and Vote**: An amendment to HB 386 failed with a vote of 11-9. Representative Kahill’s motion to retain the bill for further review passed with the same vote. The OTPA vote failed, and a motion to ITL the bill passed with a vote of 11-9.

#### **HB 487: Labor Standards**
- **Amendment and Vote**: An amendment to HB 487 failed with a vote of 11-9. The OTPA vote also failed, and a motion to ITL the bill passed with a vote of 11-9.

#### **HB 542: Unemployment Benefits**
- **Amendment and Discussion**: Representative McKenzie proposed an amendment to HB 542, aiming to increase the maximum weekly unemployment benefit from $427 to $535 for individuals earning at least $52,000 annually. The amendment sought to improve wage replacement rates for higher earners, addressing equity concerns without depleting the unemployment fund. Stress tests showed the fund would remain stable, even in mild or major recessions, though severe economic downturns could lead to higher employer taxes. The amendment failed with a vote of 9-11, and the bill itself also failed to pass.

#### **HB 744: Workers’ Compensation**
- **Amendment and Discussion**: An amendment to HB 744 proposed increasing the wage replacement rate for workers’ compensation from 60% to 66⅔%, aligning New Hampshire with the majority of states. Proponents argued the system had stabilized and it was time to improve benefits for workers. Opponents, particularly small business owners, expressed concerns about increased costs. The amendment failed with a vote of 9-11, and the bill was ultimately tabled.

#### **HB 757: Tip Pooling**
- **Amendment and Discussion**: Representative Kahill proposed an amendment requiring businesses to provide clear examples of tip-sharing practices to employees, aiming to reduce misunderstandings and violations. Critics argued the amendment would add confusion rather than clarity. The amendment failed, and the bill was also tabled.

### **Key Themes and Discussions**

1. **Workforce and Job Shortages**: Representatives raised concerns about specialized job shortages in certain industries and the loss of highly skilled workers to other states. Data highlighted New Hampshire residents commuting out of state for work, and the state’s efforts to provide training programs for high-demand occupations were discussed.

2. **Workers’ Compensation Reform**: The discussion on HB 744 included historical context of workers’ compensation reforms and the impact of changes on the insurance market. Nathan Fennessy from the National Council on Compensation Insurance (NCCI) estimated a 5% to 6.3% increase in system costs if the amendment passed. Christian Citarella from the New Hampshire Insurance Department noted that premium adjustments might vary based on individual business factors.

3. **Safety and Utilization**: The correlation between increased indemnity benefits and longer utilization of workers’ compensation benefits was highlighted. The importance of workplace safety measures in reducing claims and costs was emphasized.

4. **Legislative Process and Amendments**: The meeting outlined procedural steps for introducing and voting on amendments to bills, with specific examples provided, such as an amendment to HB 248 that excluded employees covered under collective bargaining agreements.

5. **Unemployment Fund and Economic Impact**: Discussions on HB 542 focused on balancing the need for increased unemployment benefits with maintaining the financial health of the unemployment fund. The amendment aimed to mitigate financial stress on families during unemployment while avoiding immediate tax increases for employers. However, severe recession scenarios could lead to higher taxes, with employers potentially losing a 0.5% tax reduction in 2027.
