### Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Judiciary Committee Meeting (02/03/2025)

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Judiciary Committee convened on February 3, 2025, to discuss several key legislative items. The meeting focused on bills addressing data collection in domestic violence cases, constitutional protections, privacy rights, and deceptive practices in higher education. Here is a cohesive summary of the discussions:

---

#### **1. House Bill 762 FN: Data Collection on Domestic Violence and Stalking Cases**
- **Purpose**: The bill proposes allocating $30,000 for an independent contractor to manually review domestic violence, stalking, and related criminal cases to compile and analyze data for statistical purposes. The goal is to identify resource needs and improve support for victims.
- **Support**: Representative Linda Haskins emphasized the importance of data collection for effective resource allocation.
- **Concerns**: Opponents, including Anthony Kenny and Dana Alre, argued the bill is redundant, citing existing judicial efforts and systemic issues such as wrongful detentions and lack of transparency in judicial training.
- **Judicial Branch Perspective**: Aaron Kegan, General Counsel, explained that a manual review is necessary due to paper-based records and the high cost of transitioning to electronic systems.
- **Broader Issues**: Critics highlighted systemic problems, such as the presumption of guilt in domestic violence cases and the lack of rights for defendants, arguing these should be addressed before allocating funds for data collection.
- **Outcome**: The committee closed the hearing, with plans to revisit the bill during an executive session.

#### **2. Constitutional Amendment Concurrent Resolution (CACR) 7: Presumption of Innocence**
- **Purpose**: The resolution seeks to explicitly enshrine the presumption of innocence in the New Hampshire Constitution.
- **Sponsor’s Argument**: Representative Kelly Penzer argued that codifying this principle would strengthen due process, prevent government overreach, and ensure broader application in civil and administrative cases.
- **Discussion**: The committee debated the amendment’s implications for legal proceedings and government accountability.

#### **3. House Bill 480: Forensic Liaison Pilot Program**
- **Purpose**: The bill proposes establishing a forensic liaison position in either Merrimack or Strafford County to assist in restoring competency in legal cases.
- **Outcome**: The committee voted 10-1 in favor of the bill, with Representative Andrew dissenting due to concerns about voting with several members absent.

---

#### **4. House Bill 666: Library User Confidentiality**
- **Purpose**: The bill aims to strengthen privacy protections for library users by adding restitution payments for violations of confidentiality and including library cards and membership status as confidential matters.
- **Discussion**: The committee debated the scope of penalty provisions, with suggestions to amend the bill to clarify penalties as civil rather than criminal and to limit their application to specific entities like libraries and their staff.

---

#### **5. House Bill 722: Deceptive Educational Practices**
- **Purpose**: The bill seeks to protect students from universities offering degrees unlikely to lead to financially sustainable careers.
- **Key Provisions**:
  - Requires universities to provide detailed earnings data for graduates by degree program.
  - Allows students to sue universities if misled about the financial viability of their degree.
  - Includes a waiver option for students knowingly pursuing low-earning degrees.
- **Sponsor’s Argument**: Representative Corkrin framed the bill as a consumer protection measure, highlighting the non-dischargeable nature of student loans and financial traps faced by students.
- **Opposition**: Lauren Banker, representing the University System of New Hampshire, raised concerns about the feasibility of providing earnings data and the potential negative impact on institutions.
- **Outcome**: The bill remained under discussion, with opposition from university representatives and concerns about feasibility and impact.

#### **6. Other Bills Discussed**
- **House Bill 687**: Restricts the direction of funds from class action settlements, addressing concerns about funds being diverted to activist causes rather than plaintiffs. The bill passed with a vote of 11-1.
- **House Bill 369**: Amends language regarding victim age in certain legal contexts, changing "16 years of age or under" to "less than 18 years of age." The bill passed with an amendment.
- **House Bill 697**: Provides witness fees for civilian witnesses in criminal proceedings, aligning with federal rates. Concerns were raised about reimbursing witnesses for multiple appearances and the potential financial burden on the state.

#### **Key Themes**
1. **Data and Resource Allocation**: The committee emphasized the need for accurate data to address systemic issues, particularly in domestic violence cases.
2. **Constitutional Protections**: Efforts to strengthen due process and privacy rights were a recurring theme, as seen in CACR 7 and House Bill 666.
3. **Consumer Protection**: Bills like House Bill 722 highlighted concerns about protecting individuals from financial and educational exploitation.
4. **Legislative Refinement**: The committee focused on clarifying language, addressing ambiguities, and ensuring constitutional compliance in proposed legislation.
