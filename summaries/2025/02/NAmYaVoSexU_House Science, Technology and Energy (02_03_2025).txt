The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on February 3, 2025, centered on critical energy policy discussions, particularly around **offshore wind development**, the **Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS)**, and the economic and environmental impacts of proposed legislative changes. The meeting featured debates on several bills, including **House Bill 682**, **House Bill 575**, **House Bill 219**, and **House Bill 567**, with strong arguments from legislators, industry representatives, environmental advocates, and community stakeholders.

### **Offshore Wind Development**
The debate on offshore wind energy was divided into two main bills: **House Bill 682** and **House Bill 575**. HB 682 proposed eliminating state offices and committees dedicated to offshore wind development, while HB 575 sought to ban offshore wind projects in the Gulf of Maine entirely.

#### **Key Arguments Against Offshore Wind:**
- **Economic Viability**: Critics, including Representative Harrington, argued that offshore wind is financially unsustainable without government mandates, citing the financial struggles of major developers like Ørsted and the high costs passed on to consumers.
- **Environmental Concerns**: Fishermen and environmentalists raised alarms about the potential harm to marine ecosystems, including disruption of habitats, harm to fish stocks, and the use of toxic materials in turbine blades. Commercial fisherman Ward Burn described offshore wind as an “ocean killer,” particularly due to the discharge of chlorinated, heated seawater.
- **Reliability and Backup Power**: Skeptics highlighted the unreliability of wind energy during extreme weather and the continued need for dispatchable power sources like natural gas to ensure grid stability.
- **Impact on Local Industries**: Concerns were raised about the displacement of fishermen, harm to tourism, and the potential for New Hampshire ratepayers to bear the costs of projects primarily benefiting other states.

#### **Key Arguments in Support of Offshore Wind:**
- **Clean Energy Transition**: Supporters, including Rob Werner from the League of Conservation Voters, argued that offshore wind is essential for reducing reliance on fossil fuels and combating climate change. They pointed to successful projects like Vineyard Wind as evidence of its potential.
- **Economic Growth and Job Creation**: Advocates emphasized the economic benefits of offshore wind, including job creation and investment in the renewable energy sector. They warned that banning offshore wind would foreclose future opportunities for New Hampshire.
- **Regional Collaboration**: Stakeholders stressed the importance of New Hampshire’s participation in regional energy discussions, particularly in the Gulf of Maine, to ensure the state’s interests are represented.

### **Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS)**
The RPS, which mandates a certain percentage of energy from renewable sources, was the focus of **House Bill 219** and **House Bill 567**. HB 219 proposed phasing out the RPS, while HB 567 aimed to remove thermal energy from RPS eligibility, specifically targeting biomass facilities like Burgess Biopower in Berlin.

#### **Key Arguments in Support of the RPS:**
- **Economic and Environmental Benefits**: Testifiers highlighted the RPS’s role in supporting over 3,500 jobs, attracting $800 million in solar investments, and reducing air pollution, which contributes to public health issues like respiratory and heart diseases.
- **Local Economic Impact**: Representatives from the biomass, logging, and forestry sectors emphasized the RPS’s importance in creating markets for low-grade wood, supporting rural economies, and maintaining forest health.
- **Energy Diversity and Reliability**: The RPS was praised for promoting a diverse energy mix, reducing reliance on volatile fossil fuel prices, and ensuring grid stability. Biomass and hydropower were highlighted as reliable, local energy sources.
- **Threat to Berlin’s Economy**: Testimony on HB 567 focused on the potential closure of Burgess Biopower, which contributes significantly to Berlin’s economy. Losing renewable energy credits could devastate the city, which has already suffered from the closure of major industries.

#### **Key Arguments Against the RPS:**
- **Consumer Choice**: Proponents of HB 219 argued that the RPS is a subsidy that limits consumer choice and that renewable energy should compete in the market without government mandates.
- **Cost Concerns**: Some speakers questioned the high costs of wind and solar power, which rely on federal subsidies, and argued that the RPS should focus on reducing reliance on subsidies.
- **Outdated Technology**: Critics of biomass argued that facilities like Burgess Biopower are outdated and underperforming, failing to meet current energy needs.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored a deep divide between those advocating for a market-driven energy policy and those emphasizing the need for government support to achieve clean energy goals, economic stability, and environmental protection. While opponents of offshore wind and the RPS highlighted concerns about costs, reliability, and local impacts, supporters argued that these policies are essential for combating climate change, supporting local economies, and ensuring energy diversity. The fate of these bills will hinge on whether legislators prioritize immediate economic and environmental concerns or long-term renewable energy and climate goals.
