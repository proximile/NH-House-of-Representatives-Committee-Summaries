The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened multiple meetings to discuss a wide range of budgetary, operational, and programmatic issues affecting various state departments and initiatives. The discussions highlighted the complexities of state funding, resource management, and the need to balance budget constraints with maintaining essential services. Below is a cohesive and comprehensive summary of the key topics covered across the meetings:

### **Broadband and Infrastructure**
- **Broadband Funding**: The state is navigating the complexities of federally regulated broadband funding, aiming to allocate $191 million through a multi-year plan to achieve 100% broadband access across New Hampshire.
- **Housing and Broadband Initiatives**: The Department of Business and Economic Affairs (BEA) oversees the Housing Champions program and broadband infrastructure projects, with federal grants supporting efforts to provide high-speed internet to underserved areas.

### **Economic Development and Small Business Support**
- **Small Business Development Center (SBDC)**: The SBDC, which provides technical assistance to small businesses, faces a proposed funding cut from $500,000 to $215,000, despite a 120% increase in demand over the past five years. Concerns were raised about the impact of this reduction on advising capacity and the SBDC's high return on investment.
- **Economic Development Programs**: The BEA’s Economic Development division focuses on business recruitment, expansion, and workforce training, with programs like the Apex Accelerator and the Office of Workforce Opportunity receiving significant federal funding and requiring state matching funds.

### **Retiree Healthcare and Paid Family Leave**
- **Retiree Healthcare Costs**: The state’s retiree healthcare plan, funded through Medicare Advantage, was discussed, with debates about prefunding the benefit and concerns about equity and legal obligations. Measures have been implemented to limit eligibility due to rising costs.
- **Paid Family Leave Program**: Established in 2021, the program provides benefits to state employees and incentivizes private employers to offer similar benefits. The program has seen limited uptake, with about 100 state employees making claims, and costs the state approximately $1.4 million annually.

### **Judicial Branch and Court Facilities**
- **Court Facilities and Maintenance**: The Department of Administrative Services (DAS) maintains courthouse facilities across the state, with discussions on deferred maintenance, budget cuts, and the potential closure of courthouses. The judicial branch has the authority to decide on these cuts, which could impact maintenance staff and operational costs.
- **Settlement Fund and YDC Lawsuit**: The Settlement Fund, established to compensate abuse victims from the Youth Development Center (YDC), is projected to run out of its $60 million allocation before the end of fiscal year 2025. The fund has already paid out $100 million in fiscal year 2024, with concerns about future funding and the potential for claimants to pursue legal action if the fund is depleted.

### **Department of Justice (DOJ) and Litigation**
- **DOJ Budget and Productivity**: The DOJ’s budget has increased significantly since 2019, with a focus on successful outcomes in cases ranging from murder to Medicaid fraud. The department has recovered $98 million over the biennium, including funds from tobacco and opioid lawsuit settlements.
- **Litigation Fund**: The state’s litigation fund, which covers legal expenses, has historically been managed with a cap of $350,000 per fiscal year. Concerns were raised about the fund becoming a target for lawsuits and the need for a detailed historical analysis of litigation expenses.

### **Human Rights Commission (HRC)**
- **HRC Challenges**: The HRC is facing significant delays in processing cases, with 20% of cases being precluded from going to court due to the statute of limitations running out. Staffing shortages and a growing backlog of cases have exacerbated inefficiencies, prompting calls for increased funding or potential elimination of the commission.
- **Operational Improvements**: The HRC is working to address audit findings, update training manuals, and improve administrative rules to enhance efficiency.

### **Staffing and Vacancies**
- **Department of Administrative Services (DAS)**: The DAS is undergoing a major upgrade to its ERP system, increasing licensing costs, and facing staffing challenges with a hiring freeze in place since July. Maintaining positions is crucial for operational efficiency despite current vacancies.
- **BEA Staffing**: The BEA has several vacant positions, with strategic plans in place to fill roles eligible for federal reimbursement.

### **Federal Programs and Funding**
- **Federal Surplus Food Program**: The federal government distributes surplus food to states, primarily to schools, with a $155,000 state match for a million-dollar program. The per-case charge for schools fluctuates based on federal allotments.
- **Victim Services and Grants**: The allocation of funds for victim services, including VOCA grants, internet crimes against children, and child advocacy centers, was discussed, with some programs transitioning from federal to state general funds.

### **Budgetary Concerns and Future Requests**
- **Funding Shortfalls**: Concerns were raised about the potential shortfall in the $75 million budgeted for the Settlement Fund, with discussions on requesting an additional $15 million in 2025 to maintain operations and award distributions.
- **Economic Development Funding**: The BEA is seeking an additional $3.3 million in General Funds, primarily for the Division of Travel and Tourism, based on a formula tied to the meals and rooms tax revenue.

### **Conclusion**
The meetings underscored the importance of strategic planning, efficient resource allocation, and maintaining critical services amid budgetary constraints. Key areas of focus included broadband expansion, small business support, retiree healthcare, court maintenance, victim services, and the effective functioning of the HRC and Settlement Fund. Representatives emphasized the need for transparency, historical data, and legislative oversight to address ongoing challenges and ensure the state’s long-term stability and growth.
