**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Meeting (02/12/2025)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee convened on February 12, 2025, to address a range of legislative matters, including scheduling and procedural issues, insurance-related bills, and a significant public hearing on third-party litigation financing (TPLF). The meeting highlighted the committee’s focus on refining legislation, ensuring transparency, and addressing technical corrections to existing laws amidst tight deadlines.

### **Logistical Planning and Procedural Matters (Segment 1/3)**
The meeting began with a discussion of scheduling and procedural logistics to ensure the smooth execution of legislative processes. Key points included:
- **Subcommittee Meetings**: A subcommittee on liquor and business bills was scheduled for the 18th, while the insurance subcommittee would meet on the 4th, with flexibility to accommodate higher-priority tasks or executive sessions.
- **Bill Deadlines**: The 5th was identified as a critical day for moving all 13 bills out of committee. The speaker emphasized the need for advance preparation, including assigning responsibilities for writing bill summaries (blurbs) and making motions.
- **Coordination and Communication**: The committee stressed the importance of clear communication among members to manage scheduling conflicts and ensure timely completion of tasks.
- **Deadline Pressures**: With the 6th marking the deadline for certain actions and a session scheduled on that day, the committee prioritized completing tasks by the 5th to avoid delays.

### **Insurance-Related Legislation (Segment 2/3)**
The committee reviewed several insurance-related bills, focusing on technical corrections, coverage provisions, and transparency measures:
- **House Bill 499**: The committee unanimously adopted Amendment 0364, which addressed housekeeping issues such as adjusting financial thresholds for new insurance companies and clarifying reporting requirements.
- **House Bill 552**: The bill ensures that children up to age 26 are covered under the state retirees' insurance plan, regardless of student status, aligning with federal Affordable Care Act standards. The committee unanimously passed the bill, noting that it imposes no fiscal burden on the state.
- **Withdrawal of HB 678**: The sponsor withdrew the bill related to over-the-counter sales due to concerns about enforcement and regulatory issues, particularly regarding age restrictions. The sponsor plans to revisit the issue with amendments in the future.
- **Litigation Financing (HB 733)**: Representatives from AIG and State Farm testified in support of HB 733, emphasizing the need for transparency in litigation financing to ensure all parties understand the financial stakes involved.

### **Public Hearing on Third-Party Litigation Financing (TPLF) (Segment 3/3)**
The committee held a public hearing on **House Bill 733 FN**, which seeks to regulate and increase transparency in the TPLF industry. Key highlights included:
- **Purpose of the Bill**: The bill addresses the lack of regulation in TPLF, where investors fund lawsuits without disclosure, potentially driving up insurance costs and encouraging frivolous litigation.
- **Key Provisions**: The bill requires disclosure of TPLF agreements, prohibits funding from foreign entities deemed threats to critical infrastructure, and establishes consumer protections.
- **Testimony and Concerns**:
  - **Sponsor (Rep. Cole)**: Highlighted the global scale of TPLF and its impact on the civil justice system, emphasizing the need to reduce the "tort tax" on households.
  - **Attorney General’s Office**: Raised concerns about insufficient enforcement provisions, advocating for broader authority to address misconduct.
  - **Insurance Commissioner**: Supported the bill, noting its potential to improve risk assessment and soften the hard insurance market.
  - **Trial Lawyers Association**: Argued the bill is unnecessary in New Hampshire, where TPLF is rare, and existing court rules ensure transparency.
  - **Industry Perspective (ARC)**: Supported the bill’s amendments, clarifying the distinction between **Consumer Legal Funding** and **Litigation Financing**.
- **Amendments**: The bill was amended to clarify definitions and address stakeholder concerns, balancing consumer protection, transparency, and enforcement.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the committee’s commitment to addressing complex legislative issues, from logistical planning and insurance-related technical corrections to the regulation of third-party litigation financing. By prioritizing coordination, transparency, and consumer protection, the committee aims to refine and advance legislation that aligns with the state’s interests and legal standards.
