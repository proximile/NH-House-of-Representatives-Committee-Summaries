**Summary of the NH House of Representatives Finance Division III Meeting (February 14, 2024)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Division III convened on February 14, 2024, to discuss critical fiscal matters related to housing, healthcare, and social services. The meeting centered on two key bills, **HP 71** and **HP 519**, as well as broader concerns about federal funding and compliance.

### Key Discussions and Outcomes:

1. **Housing and Federal Funding Concerns**:  
   The committee began by examining a document tied to housing and federal grants, with significant concerns raised about the potential loss of $12 to $18 million in funding if certain housing decisions were refused. Uncertainty surrounded federal demands, particularly the prohibition of using school or institutional facilities for housing. The Department's backup for the document was unclear, prompting the committee to reschedule the discussion and invite expert testimony for further clarity. Additional sessions were planned for the following week to continue the debate. Representative Mooney stressed the importance of understanding the financial impact and ensuring the presence of knowledgeable individuals to address questions.

2. **HP 519 – Funding for Waypoint**:  
   The committee deliberated on **HP 519**, which involves funding for **Waypoint**, a provider of shelter and wraparound services. Concerns were raised about the bill's potential impact on the budget process and Waypoint's operations. Public commenter **Mary Rose De** opposed the bill, advocating for funds to be directed toward teaching practical skills rather than mental health services. Ultimately, the committee voted to **retain HP 519** and integrate its subject matter into the broader budget bill (**HB2**) for further funding consideration.

3. **HP 71 – Amendment on Patient Bill of Rights Compliance**:  
   The discussion on **HP 71** focused on an amendment requiring compliance with the **Patient Bill of Rights** in state healthcare contracts. The amendment received support from **Dartmouth Health** and the **Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)**. However, concerns were raised about potential conflicts with federal requirements for refugee and immigrant housing in public schools, which could result in a loss of $12–18 million in federal funding. The committee decided to advance the amendment to the full Finance Committee for further discussion and a potential non-germane public hearing.

### General Themes and Takeaways:  
The session highlighted the tension between state and federal compliance, particularly in areas of funding, healthcare, and housing. Discussions underscored the need to balance fiscal responsibility, patient rights, and the practical needs of vulnerable populations. The committee worked to clarify its positions and ensure procedural compliance while addressing complex policy issues.

### Conclusion:  
The meeting concluded with plans for additional sessions and public hearings to further review the proposed amendments and bills. The committee adjourned with no further business to conduct, emphasizing the importance of thorough deliberation and expert input in addressing these critical fiscal and policy challenges.
