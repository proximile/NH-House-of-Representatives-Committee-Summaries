**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Work Session on HB 145 and HB 271 (02/06/2025)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives held a work session and subsequent subcommittee meeting to discuss **House Bill 145 (HB 145)** and **House Bill 271 (HB 271)**, focusing on licensing requirements, background checks, and professional compacts. Here’s a detailed summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **HB 145: Dietitian Licensing Compact and Background Checks**
**Dietitian Licensing Compact**  
- HB 145 proposes the adoption of a **Dietitian Licensing Compact** to enable reciprocity for licensed dietitians across states. Dietitians testified in favor of the compact, emphasizing its importance for their profession and the need for New Hampshire to be among the first seven states to join, which would secure a seat on the compact’s commission.  
- The compact is well-drafted and includes provisions for military spouses and criminal history checks, addressing concerns about “border hopping” by individuals with problematic backgrounds.  
- The committee expressed support for the compact but noted potential amendments might be necessary to align it with New Hampshire’s specific needs.  

**Background Check Challenges**  
- A significant portion of the discussion focused on **criminal background checks** tied to HB 145. The FBI raised concerns about the bill’s language, particularly the use of the term “office,” which was deemed too broad and could delay implementation.  
- The committee is working with the Department of Safety to refine the language to meet FBI requirements. There was a proposal to remove the background check section from HB 145 and incorporate it into **HB 82** or **HB 85**, where similar cleanup language is being addressed.  
- The committee emphasized the need for **uniform language** across all background check requirements in statutes to avoid future bureaucratic issues.  
- A subcommittee will continue discussions to finalize amendments for both HB 145 and the related background check bills.

### **HB 271: Licensing Requirements for Licensed Social Work Associates**
- HB 271 proposes removing the **exam requirement** for Licensed Social Work Associates (LSWAs), which was instituted in 2021. The exam was introduced to ensure competency but has been seen as a barrier for individuals without formal social work education.  
- Testimony on the bill was mixed. Some supported removing the exam, arguing it is unnecessary for this level of licensure, while others opposed it, citing the importance of maintaining competency standards.  
- The committee noted that the exam requirement has not been in place long enough to evaluate its effectiveness, and there is no data on pass/fail rates for LSWAs.  
- Discussions highlighted the need for an alternative **competency measure**, such as practical skills tests or a less rigorous exam tailored to LSWAs.  
- The subcommittee decided to continue the discussion in an **executive session**, potentially retaining the bill for further work or refiling it in the future.

### **General Themes and Next Steps**
- Both bills highlighted the importance of **licensing requirements**, **competency measures**, and the role of **professional compacts** in facilitating mobility and reciprocity for licensed professionals.  
- The committee emphasized the need for **data** and **stakeholder input** before making decisions, particularly for HB 271, where the exam requirement’s impact is still unclear.  
- For HB 145, the focus was on resolving the background check language to ensure FBI compliance while advancing the Dietitian Licensing Compact.  
- The subcommittee planned to continue discussions in **executive sessions**, with potential amendments or refiling of the bills for further consideration.

### **Conclusion**
The work session and subcommittee meeting underscored the committee’s efforts to address bureaucratic challenges, streamline licensing processes, and ensure competency standards across professions. While HB 145’s Dietitian Licensing Compact received strong support, the background check issue requires further refinement. HB 271’s exam requirement for LSWAs remains contentious, with the committee seeking more data and alternative solutions. Both bills will undergo further review and potential amendments in upcoming sessions.
