**Comprehensive Summary of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Transportation Committee Meeting on February 11, 2025**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives Transportation Committee convened on February 11, 2025, to discuss several bills addressing transportation, safety, and emerging mobility technologies. The meeting featured robust debates, testimony from stakeholders, and discussions on the balance between public safety, environmental concerns, and individual freedoms. Below is a consolidated summary of the key topics and bills discussed:

---

### **1. Distracted Driving and Mobile Device Use (House Bill 411)**
- **Objective**: The bill proposes making distracted driving, particularly the use of mobile devices while driving, a secondary offense. This means officers can only ticket drivers for distracted driving if they are already committing another violation (e.g., speeding or swerving).
- **Support**: Representative Ellen Reed argued that the current law is overly broad and difficult to enforce, citing a recent Supreme Court decision that highlighted enforcement challenges.
- **Opposition**: Law enforcement and safety advocates contended that weakening the law would increase road dangers, as distracted driving is a leading cause of accidents.
- **Outcome**: The committee heard testimony from both sides, with questions raised about enforcement practicality and road safety implications.

### **2. Diesel Emissions and Rolling Coal (House Bill 441)**
- **Objective**: The bill prohibits the intentional modification of diesel vehicles under 18,000 pounds to emit excessive smoke, a practice known as "rolling coal."
- **Support**: Advocates emphasized the public health, environmental, and safety benefits, noting that black carbon emissions contribute to climate change and impair road visibility.
- **Opposition**: Critics argued that existing state and federal anti-tampering laws already address this issue, making the bill redundant.
- **Outcome**: The committee considered the balance between public health benefits and existing regulations.

---

### **3. Driver’s License Testing Materials (House Bill 461)**
- **Objective**: The bill requires all driver’s license testing materials to be available only in English.
- **Support**: Proponents argued that English proficiency is essential for road safety and communication.
- **Opposition**: Organizations like the International Institute of New England contended that this would hinder immigrants’ ability to obtain licenses, negatively impacting the workforce and economy. They noted that immigrants are already motivated to learn English.
- **Outcome**: The debate highlighted the tension between safety concerns and inclusivity for diverse communities.

---

### **4. Cyclist Safety and the Idaho Stop (House Bill 249)**
- **Objective**: The bill allows bicyclists to treat stop signs as yield signs and stop lights as stop signs, adopting the "Idaho stop" model.
- **Support**: Representative Seth Miller and cycling advocates argued that this would improve cyclist safety and traffic flow, citing successful implementations in Idaho and Delaware.
- **Concerns**: Opponents raised questions about potential confusion for drivers and liability issues.
- **Outcome**: Testimony from cyclists and safety instructors emphasized the benefits of formalizing common practices and incentivizing cycling.

### **5. Vehicle Inspections and Emissions Testing (House Bills 212 and 649)**
#### **House Bill 212: Extending Emission Control Test Waiver Period**
- **Objective**: Extends the temporary waiver period for vehicles failing an EPA OBD2 emission control test from 60 days to 180 days.
- **Support**: Advocates argued that the extension provides consumers more time to save money for costly repairs, particularly given supply chain delays and repair complexities.
- **Opposition**: The Department of Environmental Services noted that extending the waiver period would require revising the state’s Clean Air Act implementation plan, a lengthy process.

#### **House Bill 649: Eliminating Vehicle Safety Inspections and Emissions Testing**
- **Objective**: Repeals requirements for annual vehicle safety inspections and emissions testing for passenger vehicles.
- **Support**:
  - Critics of the current system argued that inspections are subjective, inconsistent, and financially burdensome, particularly for low-income individuals.
  - Supporters noted that only 11 states still require annual inspections and that modern vehicles are inherently safer.
- **Opposition**:
  - Safety advocates, law enforcement, and the New Hampshire Auto Dealers Association stressed the importance of inspections for identifying unsafe vehicles, preventing accidents, and ensuring environmental compliance.
  - Opponents also highlighted the potential loss of federal highway funding tied to Clean Air Act compliance.
- **Outcome**: The debate underscored the divide between those viewing inspections as a necessary safety measure and those seeing them as an unnecessary financial burden.

### **6. Regulation of Personal Electric Vehicles (House Bill 715)**
- **Objective**: Addresses the regulation of emerging electric mobility devices, including e-bikes, electric scooters, and electric unicycles.
- **Key Points**:
  - **Classification Challenges**: Questions arose about federal vs. state classifications, particularly for use on federally funded rail trails.
  - **Safety Education**: The bill proposes requiring operators aged 12 and older to complete a safety course, though concerns were raised about enforcement and younger users.
  - **ADA Compliance**: Clarifications were made that existing laws cover electric wheelchairs and scooters used by individuals with disabilities.
  - **Study Committee**: Stakeholders suggested forming a study committee to develop clearer definitions, classifications, and safety education programs for PEVs.
- **Outcome**: The committee recognized the need for updated regulations to address the rapid evolution of electric mobility technologies.

---

### **Next Steps**
- The committee plans to hold an executive session to further deliberate on the bills, gather additional data, and address fiscal and enforcement concerns.
- A final executive session is scheduled for early March to finalize recommendations before the March 6 deadline for early reporting.

### **Key Themes**
1. **Public Safety vs. Individual Freedom**: Many bills, such as those on distracted driving, vehicle inspections, and PEVs, sparked debates about balancing public safety with personal liberties and financial burdens.
2. **Environmental Impact**: Discussions on emissions testing and diesel modifications highlighted the importance of maintaining air quality standards and complying with federal environmental laws.
3. **Emerging Technologies**: The regulation of PEVs underscored the challenges of adapting laws to rapidly evolving technologies and ensuring safety without stifling innovation.
4. **Inclusivity and Accessibility**: Bills like HB 461 raised questions about inclusivity for immigrants and individuals with disabilities, emphasizing the need for equitable policies.

The meeting reflected the complexity of transportation policy, with stakeholders advocating for diverse perspectives on safety, environmental protection, and economic considerations.
