### Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Finance Division II Meeting (February 3, 2025)

The NH House of Representatives Finance Division II meeting on February 3, 2025, focused extensively on education funding, addressing various components such as **charter school funding**, **Education Freedom Accounts (EFAs)**, **stabilization and hold harmless grants**, **the adequacy formula**, and **federal funding**. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

---

### **1. Charter School Funding**
- **Base and Additional Grants**: Charter schools receive state aid based on a formula similar to district adequacy funding. The total funding is $6,710.79 per student, with a base adequacy aid of $4,265.64. Additional grants are provided for students qualifying for free and reduced lunch (FNR), special education, and English language learners. Special education aid is paid directly to towns, while other rates are paid to charter schools by the state.
- **Historical Trends**: Funding trends from FY 2017 to FY 2026 were reviewed, including pandemic-related enrollment changes.
- **Virtual vs. Non-Virtual Charter Schools**: Virtual charter schools receive an additional grant of $2,445.15 per student, while non-virtual charter schools receive $597.86.

### **2. Education Freedom Accounts (EFAs)**
- **Program Overview**: EFAs, established in FY 2022, allow parents to use state funds for educational options outside public schools. Funding is based on RSA 198 adequacy numbers, with quarterly disbursements to a scholarship organization, which allocates funds to families via a digital wallet.
- **Growth and Funding**: The program has grown significantly, with an estimated $30 million allocated for FY 2025.
- **Phase Out Grant**: This grant supports school districts when students leave for EFAs, providing 100% of adequacy funds in the first year, 50% in the second, and 25% in the third. The grant will end in FY 2026.
- **Accountability**: The scholarship organization is accountable to the Department of Education, Department of Revenue, the Attorney General’s Office, and a legislative oversight committee.

### **3. Stabilization and Hold Harmless Grants**
- **Stabilization Grants**: Introduced in 2012, these grants ensured no community received less funding than in 2011. They were fully restored in 2020 but eliminated in 2024.
- **Hold Harmless Provision**: A new provision ensures communities do not lose funding, set at $59 million, significantly lower than the original $158 million. Despite declining student populations, overall education spending increased by $193 million in the last budget cycle.

### **4. Adequacy Formula and State Funding**
- **Base Adequacy Aid**: The adequacy formula provides $4,265 per student, adjusted annually. Additional funding is allocated for students in poverty, special education, and English language learners.
- **Excess Swept Communities**: Communities where local property taxes exceed the cost of providing an adequate education retain excess funds. However, ongoing litigation could require these funds to be remitted to the state, potentially leading to local tax increases or budget cuts.
- **Hold Harmless Grants**: These grants ensure districts do not receive less funding than in previous years, though they are being phased out, with current grants reduced to 80% of previous levels.
- **Extraordinary Needs Grants**: This grant targets districts with high poverty and low property values, providing additional funding based on equalized property valuations and poverty rates.

---

### **5. Federal Funding for Education**
- **Major Programs**: The state receives approximately $140 million annually in federal funding, primarily through Title I (for disadvantaged students), IDEA (special education grants), and Title II (professional development). Other programs include 21st Century Learning Centers (after-school programs), migrant education funding, and rural school support.
- **Key Legislation**: The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) govern these funds.

---

### **6. Tax Rates and Equalized Valuation**
- **Equalized Tax Rates**: These rates allow for accurate comparisons between towns by accounting for differences in property assessment practices, avoiding misleading comparisons based on raw tax rates.

---

### **7. Future Discussions and Concerns**
- **Upcoming Topics**: The committee plans to discuss food and nutrition programs, special education, building facilities, and federal funding allocations.
- **Cash Flow Concerns**: The potential remittance of excess swept funds could create financial challenges for towns, requiring local tax increases or budget cuts.
- **Zero-Sum Redistribution**: Redistributing excess swept funds is a zero-sum game, benefiting some communities while harming others.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the complexities of New Hampshire’s education funding system, emphasizing the need for clarity, transparency, and accountability in funding laws and formulas. Key decisions on charter school funding, EFAs, stabilization grants, and the adequacy formula will significantly impact school districts and towns across the state. The committee plans to continue discussions on these critical issues in upcoming sessions.
