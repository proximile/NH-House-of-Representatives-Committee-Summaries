The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting covered a wide range of critical topics, focusing on the state’s judicial branch, insurance department, public defender system, and employment security programs. Key discussions revolved around budget challenges, funding needs, operational efficiencies, and strategies to address systemic issues in these areas.

### **Judicial Branch and Public Defender System**
The judicial branch faces significant budgetary pressures, with increasing caseloads and underfunding creating challenges in meeting constitutional obligations. The public defender program, a cost-effective means of providing legal representation, is struggling with high caseloads, low salaries, and high attrition rates. The shortage of attorneys, particularly in rural areas, has led to reliance on more expensive assigned counsel, exacerbating costs. The judicial branch’s budget for FY 2026 is $128 million, but the governor’s proposed budget falls short by approximately $10 million, necessitating cost-saving measures such as court consolidations and potential closures in underutilized locations like Hooksett and Goffstown. 

The Judicial Council, which oversees indigent defense and civil legal services, manages a $39 million budget with only three full-time staff members. It struggles with manual processing of attorney and vendor bills, highlighting the need for additional financial oversight. The council has requested increased funding to hire more attorneys and raise salaries to retain experienced staff. Additionally, the implementation of House Bill 318, which introduced new responsibilities related to bail reform, has added $1.8 million in annual costs, including payments to bail commissioners and the hiring of additional magistrates.

### **Insurance Department and Risk Mitigation**
The New Hampshire Insurance Department, with a $15.5 million budget funded by assessments on insurance companies, has returned $2.6 million to the industry due to careful budget management. The department faces challenges in a "hard market" driven by economic factors, catastrophic weather events, and rising costs, leading to higher premiums and market withdrawals in some areas. Commissioner DJ Bettencourt proposed the **Granite State Home Resiliency and Mitigation Fund**, which would provide grants of up to $10,000 for homeowners to make property improvements that reduce insurance risks. The program would be funded by $1 million from the insurance premium tax, with potential leveraging of federal funds.

The department emphasized a collaborative regulatory approach, given New Hampshire’s small market share (less than 0.5% of the U.S. insurance market). It conducts financial and market conduct examinations to ensure solvency and compliance, and its fraud division has been effective in referring cases for prosecution. Discussions also highlighted challenges faced by homeowners in coastal areas, with representatives sharing personal experiences of rising premiums and deductibles.

### **Employment Security and Paid Family Medical Leave**
The Department of Employment Security oversees unemployment insurance and job training programs, relying on federal funding and employer taxes. The state’s Paid Family Medical Leave Act, administered through a contract with MetLife, provides coverage for family and medical leave, supporting workers who need time off for bonding with newborns or caring for ill family members.

### **Broader Challenges and Solutions**
Across all areas, the meeting underscored the need for innovative solutions and increased funding to address systemic challenges. In the judicial branch, discussions included increasing filing fees, which have not been adjusted since 2013, to generate additional revenue. In the insurance sector, the focus was on mitigating risks through property improvements and leveraging federal funds. The public defender system and Judicial Council emphasized the need for higher salaries and more staff to reduce caseloads and improve retention. 

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the interconnectedness of budgetary constraints, operational efficiencies, and the need for strategic investments to ensure access to justice, consumer protection, and economic stability. Representatives and state officials discussed a range of potential solutions, from court consolidations and fee adjustments to new grant programs and federal funding opportunities, to address these pressing issues effectively.
