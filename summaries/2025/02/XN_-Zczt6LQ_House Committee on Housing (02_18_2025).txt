### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **HB 383: Condominium Governance**
- **Purpose**: The bill aims to address challenges in condominium governance, particularly voting practices, bylaws, and conflicts with existing laws.
- **Key Issues**:
  - Condominium associations vary widely, from small quadplexes to large seasonal campgrounds, leading to inconsistent governance.
  - Current laws lack clarity on voting thresholds and rule-making, resulting in disputes and lawsuits.
  - The bill proposes allowing bylaws to be changed by a simple majority of those present at a meeting, raising concerns about empowering small, vocal minorities.
- **Testimony**:
  - **Support**: Representative Aly emphasized the need for flexible laws to address diverse condominium needs.
  - **Opposition**: Critics, including Richard Swat and William Infantine, argued the bill could destabilize governance and allow minority rule.
- **Outcome**: The committee voted 17-1 to recommend the bill as "inexpedient to legislate" (ITL), deeming it unworkable.

#### **HB 410: Zoning Restrictions**
- **Purpose**: The bill seeks to limit overly restrictive zoning ordinances by requiring towns to justify them based on health, safety, and empirical evidence.
- **Key Provisions**:
  - Allows rural residential uses on commercially zoned lots and in-home businesses in residential zones.
  - Caps fees for low-to-moderate-income property owners and permits camping on private land.
  - Requires towns to justify lot size restrictions (e.g., over 5 acres) and other extraordinary zoning practices.
- **Testimony**:
  - **Support**: Many committee members supported the bill’s intent to ensure zoning is based on legitimate concerns, not exclusionary practices.
  - **Opposition**: The NH Municipal Association argued the bill undermines local control and creates burdensome empirical evidence requirements.
- **Outcome**: A subcommittee was formed to refine the bill’s language and address concerns.

#### **HB 457: "Frat House Bill" (Student Housing)**
- **Purpose**: The bill aims to eliminate restrictions on the number of unrelated individuals living together in single-family residential zones, particularly in college towns like Durham.
- **Key Issues**:
  - Durham’s "three unrelated rule" limits housing options for students, increasing rental costs.
  - Supporters argued the bill promotes affordability and property rights, while opponents raised concerns about neighborhood character and enforcement.
- **Testimony**:
  - **Support**: Samuel Hooper (Institute for Justice) and students emphasized the need for fair housing access.
  - **Opposition**: Durham officials proposed aligning local zoning with the state fire code, which allows up to four unrelated individuals.
- **Outcome**: The committee considered a compromise amendment to align local zoning with state fire code restrictions.

#### **HB 465: Housing Opportunity Zone Program (RSA 79E)**
- **Purpose**: The bill clarifies and improves the RSA 79E program, which incentivizes affordable housing development by freezing property tax assessments.
- **Key Changes**:
  - Introduces income verification guidelines and a one-year grace period for tenants exceeding income thresholds.
  - Expands the program to include accessory dwelling units (ADUs) without requiring income verification.
  - Clarifies that only the ADU portion of a property has its valuation frozen.
- **Testimony**:
  - **Support**: Advocates highlighted the bill’s flexibility and potential to increase affordable housing supply.
  - **Concerns**: Questions were raised about enforcement and administrative demands.
- **Outcome**: The bill was supported as a way to improve the program’s accessibility and effectiveness.

#### **Other Bills and Amendments**
- **HB 577 (ADUs)**: The committee passed an amendment ensuring municipalities cannot restrict ADUs to less than 750 sq. ft. and allowing regulation of owner occupancy. The bill was recommended "ought to pass as amended" (OTP-A).

2. **Affordability and Equity**: Discussions emphasized the need to reduce barriers to affordable housing, particularly for students, low-income individuals, and those seeking shared living arrangements.
3. **Property Rights vs. Community Impact**: Tensions arose between protecting property rights and preserving neighborhood character, especially in areas with high student populations.
4. **Need for Clarity and Flexibility**: Stakeholders highlighted the importance of clear, flexible laws to address diverse housing needs while avoiding unintended consequences.
