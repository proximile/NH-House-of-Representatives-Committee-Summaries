The New Hampshire House of Representatives' Education Policy and Administration Committee convened on February 12, 2025, to discuss a range of education-related bills and policies. The meeting highlighted critical issues such as accountability in education programs, student safety, local control, and the role of charter schools. Here is a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

### **Accountability and Transparency in Education Programs**
1. **Education Freedom Account (EFA) Program**: Concerns were raised about the lack of accountability and achievement data in the EFA program. Representatives emphasized the need for actionable measures, including parental surveys and comprehensive achievement data akin to standardized testing in public schools. Legislative oversight was also stressed to ensure advisory committees meet their obligations.
2. **Charter School Records**: A bill (HB 740) was introduced to ensure that student records from closed charter schools are maintained by the Department of Education. The discussion focused on the importance of continuity and protection of student records, with clarity needed on retention policies and potential fees for transcript requests.
3. **Survey and Reporting Requirements**: A bill requiring service organizations to send survey results back to the department was discussed, with an annual report by the commission. The survey aims to understand why students are leaving public schools, providing aggregate data to help public schools improve.

### **Legislative Actions on Specific Bills**
1. **Menstrual Products in Schools (HB 415)**: The committee unanimously voted to recommend "ITL" (Inexpedient to Legislate) on this bill, which sought to remove the requirement for schools to provide menstrual products. Members felt the existing mandate, in place since 2019, was effective and had no complaints from districts.
2. **Special Education Reports (HB 388)**: The committee unanimously voted "ITL" on this bill, citing student privacy concerns and the availability of similar information through other bills.
3. **Adoption Information in Schools (HB 730)**: The committee unanimously voted "ITL" on this bill, which required schools to provide information on adoption during health education. Members felt the bill was not the right vehicle for addressing the topic.
4. **Kindergarten Literacy Readiness Program (HB 671)**: The committee unanimously voted "Ought to Pass" (OTP) on this bill, which would establish a statewide nonprofit digital literacy program for young learners. The program was praised for its potential to support early literacy and kindergarten readiness.
5. **Constitution Day and Patriotic Exercises (HB 571)**: The committee moved to recommend "OTP" on this bill, which would require schools to recognize Constitution Day. Members emphasized the importance of teaching students about the U.S. and New Hampshire Constitutions, with local control over implementation.

### **Curriculum and Staffing Issues**
1. **School Nurses (HB 208)**: The committee debated an amendment to allow superintendents and school boards to appoint licensed school nurses without specific pediatric experience, aiming to address the nursing shortage. The amendment passed 10-8, and the bill itself also passed with the same margin.
2. **Education Curriculum (HB 283)**: The committee considered a bill proposing to reduce required curriculum subjects to focus on core subjects like math, reading, and writing. The bill faced significant opposition, with members arguing it would diminish education quality by cutting essential subjects like arts, music, and civics. The committee voted to indefinitely postpone the bill (ITL).
3. **Brain Injury Services (HB 699)**: The committee discussed an amendment related to brain injury services, including additional language requested by the New Hampshire Brain Injury Association. Further discussion was delayed until the amendment was ready.

### **Student Safety and Background Checks**
1. **Background Checks for In-Person Instruction (HB 738)**: The committee discussed a bill requiring criminal background checks for individuals providing in-person instruction in state-funded programs, including those in homeschooling or alternative education programs. An amendment clarified that the bill does not impact homeschooling families unless they use state funds. Concerns were raised about government overreach, ambiguity, and the cost of implementation. Homeschooling advocates argued the bill imposes unnecessary burdens on families and co-ops with existing safety measures.
2. **Repealing the Right of First Refusal for Charter Schools (HB 719)**: The bill seeks to repeal a law granting charter schools the first right of refusal to purchase or lease unused public school buildings. Opponents argued it undermines local control, while supporters contended charter schools, as public schools, should have access to taxpayer-funded assets. The law is relatively new, with only one charter school successfully using it so far.

### **Key Takeaways**
The meeting underscored the importance of accountability and transparency in education programs, particularly the EFA program and charter schools. Legislative actions reflected a commitment to maintaining comprehensive curricula, addressing staffing shortages, and ensuring student safety through background checks. The discussions also highlighted ongoing debates over local control versus equitable access to public resources for charter schools and the need to balance government oversight with parental rights in education. Overall, the committee demonstrated a bipartisan focus on improving educational outcomes while addressing practical concerns and safeguarding student welfare.
