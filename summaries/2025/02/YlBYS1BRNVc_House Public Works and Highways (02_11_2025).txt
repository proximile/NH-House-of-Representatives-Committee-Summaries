The New Hampshire House of Representatives Public Works and Highways Committee meeting on February 11, 2025, focused on the executive session for several house bills related to transportation and infrastructure. The session began with a brief recess for party caucuses before diving into the bills. Key points from the meeting include:

1. **HB 1881**: The committee discussed a bill making the state responsible for maintaining Opticon systems for fire and emergency services on state roads. The motion to recommend the bill as "Inexpedient to Legislate" (ITL) passed unanimously, as an existing system already addresses the issue.

2. **HB 7113**: The committee debated a bill to install mile markers along Route 112, specifically the Canam Mangus Highway, to improve safety in the rural area. Despite concerns about cost ($287,600), the motion to recommend "Ought to Pass" (OTP) passed unanimously, emphasizing its importance for safety.

3. **HB 300**: A bill directing the Department of Transportation to issue proposals for the Conway Branch rail line and establish a study committee for the future of railroads was discussed. The motion to recommend ITL passed unanimously, as similar studies had already been conducted.

4. **HB 375**: The committee considered a bill allowing municipalities to designate sections of state and local highways for all-terrain vehicles. The motion to recommend ITL passed unanimously, as existing processes already allow towns to make such designations.

5. **HB 578**: A bill to erect a sound barrier along the Everett Turnpike was discussed. The motion to recommend ITL passed with 16 in favor and 2 opposed, as the project had not gone through the standard 10-year plan process.

6. **HB 561**: The committee discussed a bill regarding the transfer of state-owned real property to municipalities. The motion to retain the bill for further study passed unanimously, with plans to visit Continental Boulevard and gather more information.

The committee concluded by scheduling their next meeting for February 24, 2025, to discuss the capital budget overview and bonding measures. The session ended with no further business.
