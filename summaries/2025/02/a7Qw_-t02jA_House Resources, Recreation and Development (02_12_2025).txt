The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on February 12, 2025, focused on several key bills related to resources, recreation, and development. Hereâ€™s a comprehensive summary of the discussions and decisions:

### **House Bill 683: Off-Highway Recreational Vehicles (OHRVs)**
This bill proposed changes to regulations governing OHRVs and their use on state roads. 

**Support for the Bill:**
- **John P.** and **Jerry Livy** argued that opening state roads to OHRVs would boost local economies and improve trail connectivity, benefiting small businesses and recreational users.

**Opposition to the Bill:**
- **Ann Davis**, **Gary Newfield**, **Walter Payne**, **Captain Eastman**, **Abby Evano**, **Doug Souther**, **Matt Ley**, **Katherine Corkery**, and **Jason Stock** raised concerns about noise, safety, environmental impact, enforcement challenges, and the lack of clarity on notification costs. They emphasized the importance of abutter notification and the need for better management of OHRV trails.

**Conclusion:**
The bill faced significant opposition from residents, conservation groups, and law enforcement. The committee was urged to either vote the bill inexpedient to legislate or retain it for further review by the OHRV Study Commission.

### **House Bill 691: Prohibition of Fluoridation Chemicals in Public Water Systems**
This bill sought to ban the addition of fluoridation chemicals to public water systems.

**Support for the Bill:**
- Supporters argued that fluoridation poses neurotoxic risks, violates informed consent, contributes to environmental pollution, and lacks sufficient scientific evidence for its safety and effectiveness. They cited federal court rulings and studies questioning fluoridation's benefits.

**Opposition to the Bill:**
- Opponents emphasized the dental health benefits of fluoridation, particularly for vulnerable populations. They argued that fluoridation is safe, cost-effective, and should remain a local decision. Representatives from the New Hampshire Oral Health Coalition, DHHS, and DES highlighted the importance of community control and the negative impact on oral health if fluoridation were removed.

**Conclusion:**
The committee voted 14-1 to recommend the bill as "Inexpedient to Legislate" (ITL), effectively rejecting it based on the belief that fluoridation should remain a local decision.

### **Other Key Bills Discussed:**
1. **HB 568 (Subdivision Regulations on Water Supply)**: Deemed "Inexpedient to Legislate" (ITL) due to concerns about costs and overreach.
2. **HB 582 (Safety Requirements for Personal Watercraft)**: Deemed ITL as existing laws already address safety measures.
3. **HB 595 (Coastal Resilience Zones)**: Retained for further work to refine components addressing flooding issues.
4. **HB 607 (Funding for Hampton Beach Area Commission)**: Recommended to "Ought to Pass" (OTP) for supporting economic development.
5. **HB 624 (Local River Management Advisory Committee Grant Program)**: Amended and recommended to OTP to streamline funding for river management.
6. **HB 629 (Funding for State Dam Maintenance)**: Retained for further work on amendments and funding.
7. **HB 644 (Flying Drones in State Parks)**: Deemed ITL as the Department of Parks and Recreation is already addressing drone usage.
8. **HB 657 (Short Notice Booking Act for State Parks)**: Withdrawn at the request of the prime sponsor.
9. **HB 663 (Moose Plate Funds for Historic Resources)**: Passed unanimously, allowing the Division of Historic Resources to use Moose Plate funds for administrative costs.

### **Key Themes:**
- **Transparency and Process**: Emphasis on transparent processes, public hearings, and notifications for land use and funding decisions.
- **Local Control**: Support for empowering municipalities to make decisions regarding local resources.
- **Funding and Cost Concerns**: Frequent discussions on the financial implications of proposed bills.
- **Retention for Further Work**: Some bills retained for additional analysis or amendments.

### **Next Steps:**
- **Caucus Breaks**: Both Republicans and Democrats held caucus breaks to discuss amendments and other issues.
- **Upcoming Hearings**: Additional hearings scheduled for bills such as HB 683 (OHRVs) and HB 691 (Fluoridation).

### **Conclusion:**
The meeting concluded with a reminder to submit reports and no scheduled sessions for the following week. The discussions reflected a strong emphasis on local decision-making, public input, and ensuring proposed legislation was clear, necessary, and financially feasible.
