**Summary of the New Hampshire House Children and Family Law Meeting on February 10, 2025**

The New Hampshire House Children and Family Law subcommittee convened on February 10, 2025, to discuss two critical pieces of legislation aimed at protecting vulnerable children and supporting families. The meeting focused on addressing prenatal substance exposure and clarifying definitions of child abuse and neglect, particularly emotional and psychological abuse. Key points from the discussions are as follows:

### **Prenatal Substance Exposure and Child Protection**
1. **Legislative Ambiguity**: A significant portion of the meeting centered on a bill addressing prenatal substance exposure. Legislators expressed concerns about ambiguity in the bill’s language, particularly regarding when referrals to child protective services should be triggered. There was a call for clarity to ensure that pregnant women are not deterred from seeking prenatal care due to fear of legal repercussions.

2. **Monitoring and Care**: The bill proposes that pregnant women using substances must be monitored by a licensed healthcare provider, especially in the third trimester. However, there was debate over whether this monitoring should begin earlier in the pregnancy to better protect the child.

3. **Unintended Consequences**: Legislators worried that the bill’s current language might discourage women from seeking necessary prenatal care, particularly in high-risk pregnancies. They emphasized the need to refine the language to avoid these unintended consequences while still safeguarding children.

4. **Support for Mothers**: The discussion highlighted the importance of supporting mothers post-birth to ensure they can provide a safe environment for their children. This includes offering resources and support to help mothers recover from substance use and maintain family stability.

5. **Existing Protections**: It was noted that New Hampshire already has federal and state requirements for the care of substance-exposed newborns, including safe care plans coordinated by hospitals. This raised questions about whether the new legislation is necessary or if it duplicates existing protections.

6. **Data and Research**: Legislators requested data on the impact of similar laws in other states, particularly regarding the correlation between such legislation and the rate of prenatal care sought by women with substance use disorders.

7. **Next Steps**: The committee plans to meet again in March to review proposed amendments to the bill, aiming to refine the language to balance child protection with the encouragement of prenatal care and support for mothers.

### **Defining Child Abuse and Neglect (House Bill 553)**
1. **Purpose of the Bill**: HB 553 seeks to clarify definitions of child abuse and neglect, with a particular emphasis on emotional and psychological abuse. The bill builds on previous work by Senator Carson and advocates, incorporating trauma-informed language and rebuttable presumptions of harm.

2. **Constitutionality and Legal Concerns**: Representative Eimon confirmed the bill’s constitutionality, citing case law such as *Troxel v. Granville*. The bill does not expand punitive measures but focuses on providing clear definitions to guide future legislation.

3. **Emotional and Psychological Abuse**: The committee emphasized that the bill targets severe, persistent behaviors such as ridiculing, terrorizing, or isolating a child, rather than parental disagreements like grounding a child or denying gender-affirming care. The Department of Children and Families (DCF) clarified that prudent parenting (e.g., asking a child to clean their room) does not constitute abuse.

4. **Substance Abuse and Prenatal Care**: Concerns were raised about the bill’s potential impact on pregnant women with substance use disorders. The bill includes a rebuttable presumption of harm for newborns exposed to substances, but stakeholders like New Futures and Dartmouth Health expressed concerns that it might deter women from seeking prenatal care.

5. **Trauma-Informed Language**: The bill incorporates trauma-informed language to address the needs of children affected by parental substance abuse or emotional abuse. This is seen as a step toward better understanding and addressing the long-term impacts of trauma on children.

6. **Impact on Families**: The committee stressed that the bill is not intended to increase the removal of children from homes but to provide clarity and support for families. The goal is to preserve family unity while ensuring child safety.

7. **Ongoing Work**: The subcommittee plans to continue refining the bill, focusing on ensuring that definitions are clear and that the bill does not inadvertently harm families or deter individuals from seeking help.

### **Overall Themes**
Both segments of the meeting underscored the complexity of crafting legislation that addresses the needs of vulnerable children and families, particularly in cases involving prenatal substance exposure and emotional or psychological abuse. Legislators emphasized the importance of balancing child protection with support for mothers and families, avoiding unintended consequences, and incorporating trauma-informed approaches. The committee plans to continue refining both bills, with a focus on clarity, data-driven decision-making, and preserving family unity.
