The New Hampshire House of Representatives Municipal and County Government Committee convened on February 18, 2025, to address a wide range of issues related to municipal and county governance, including carbon sequestration, homelessness, historic horse racing (HHR) facilities, election procedures, and property tax exemptions. The meeting included public hearings, executive sessions, and detailed discussions on several bills and amendments. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics and decisions:

---

### **1. Carbon Sequestration and Forest Carbon Markets**
   - **Support for Carbon Sequestration Amendment**: Brody Dees, representing the Hampshire Municipal Association, supported an amendment proposing a yield tax on carbon tonnage to recoup lost timber tax revenues due to carbon sequestration.
   - **Opposition to Non-Germane Amendment**: Bill Ardinger of Aurora Sustainable Lands opposed an amendment that could infringe on private property rights and create regulatory takings.
   - **Concerns Over Forest Carbon Markets**: Matt Ley from the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests opposed an amendment related to forest carbon markets, citing potential loss of tax revenue and the complexity of forest carbon management.
   - **Public Lands and Carbon Sequestration**: A non-germane amendment to House Bill 125 proposed prohibiting state and county lands from being enrolled in carbon sequestration programs. Supporters argued public lands should be used for traditional purposes like recreation and timber production, while opponents, including the New Hampshire Timberland Owners Association and The Nature Conservancy, stressed the importance of private property rights and voluntary carbon markets.
