**Comprehensive Summary of the NH House of Representatives Commerce and Consumer Affairs Subcommittee Meeting (02/12/2025): Ambulance Service Reimbursement Discussion**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Commerce and Consumer Affairs Subcommittee convened to address critical issues surrounding ambulance service reimbursement rates and related legislation. The discussion centered on the financial challenges faced by ambulance providers, the impact of balance billing on patients, and the need for a standardized, data-driven approach to reimbursement. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points and debates:

---

### **1. Ambulance Reimbursement Rates and Cost Studies**
- **Discrepancies in Cost Data**: The subcommittee examined two conflicting studies on ambulance service costs. One study reported an average cost of $1,200 per ambulance run, based on billing company averages, while another, derived from a formula created by a Tilton-Northfield Fire Department representative, estimated the cost at $2,000. The latter formula allocated 70% of the operating budget to EMS costs and 30% to fire-related services.
- **Methodology Concerns**: Representatives debated the validity of the methodologies used, particularly the mixing of fire and EMS costs. The federal Ground Ambulance Data Collection Survey (GATS) requires more detailed cost allocations, which were not reflected in the fire department’s formula. This raised questions about the accuracy and applicability of the $2,000 figure.

### **2. Proposed Legislation**
Three bills were under consideration to address reimbursement disparities and balance billing:
- **House Bill 185**: Proposed mandating that insurance companies pay the full amount billed by ambulance services unless a pre-existing contract existed, effectively eliminating balance billing for patients. The subcommittee unanimously voted to recommend **inexpedient to legislate** on HB 185, opting to focus on other bills for a more comprehensive solution.
- **House Bill 725**: Aimed to set a reimbursement floor at 325% of the Medicare rate for out-of-network ambulance services and prohibit balance billing.
- **House Bill 316**: Proposed a reimbursement rate of 204% of the Medicare rate, based on a cost study conducted by an outside consultant (PCG), and also prohibited balance billing.

### **3. Key Issues and Debates**
- **Reimbursement Rate Debate**: There was significant disagreement over the appropriate reimbursement rate. Proponents of HB 725 argued for a higher rate (325% of Medicare) to ensure the financial sustainability of ambulance services, particularly in rural areas. Supporters of HB 316 advocated for a data-driven approach (204% of Medicare), citing the PCG cost study as a more accurate reflection of actual costs.
- **Balance Billing**: The committee acknowledged the negative impact of balance billing on patients, particularly the uninsured and those on Medicare. While Medicare sets allowable rates, balance billing for the remaining 20% is federally mandated. For commercial insurance, balance billing occurs due to perceived inadequate reimbursement. The proposed legislation aimed to eliminate balance billing while ensuring fair reimbursement for providers.
- **Insurance Networks**: Representatives noted the difficulty of including ambulance services in insurance networks, as emergency services are not typically pre-arranged. The proposed legislation would set a reimbursement floor but allow parties to negotiate higher rates.

### **4. Stakeholder Perspectives**
- **Ambulance Providers**: Many providers, especially in rural areas, argued that current reimbursement rates are insufficient to cover operational costs, leading to financial instability. Some providers have significantly increased their charges since the PCG study, creating discrepancies between the study’s findings and current billing practices.
- **Insurance Companies**: The insurance industry resisted higher reimbursement rates, expressing concern that they could lead to increased premiums for policyholders.
- **Taxpayers**: In some cases, municipal taxpayers cover the financial shortfall, particularly for fire department-run ambulance services.

### **5. Legislative Intent and Next Steps**
The subcommittee aimed to find a balanced solution that ensures the financial sustainability of ambulance services while protecting patients from excessive out-of-pocket costs. The focus was on eliminating balance billing and establishing fair reimbursement rates based on accurate cost data. The committee prioritized a long-term, data-driven approach over arbitrary numbers, with HB 316 and HB 725 seen as the primary vehicles for addressing these issues.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting underscored the complexity of ambulance service reimbursement and the need for a standardized, equitable system. The subcommittee’s discussions highlighted the challenges of balancing the financial needs of ambulance providers with the goal of protecting patients from balance billing. By focusing on data-driven solutions and stakeholder input, the committee aims to create a fair and sustainable reimbursement framework for ambulance services in New Hampshire.
