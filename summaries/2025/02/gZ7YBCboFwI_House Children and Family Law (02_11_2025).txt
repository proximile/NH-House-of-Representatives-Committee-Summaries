### **Key Bills and Discussions**

#### **House Bill 430: Retention Period for Unfounded Abuse and Neglect Reports**
The committee debated House Bill 430, which proposes reducing the retention period for records of unfounded abuse and neglect reports by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) from 10 years to 3 years.  
- **Supporters**, including Chairman James Spain, argued that the current 10-year period causes undue mental anguish for families.  
- **Opponents**, such as the Office of the Child Advocate, emphasized the importance of retaining records to identify patterns of abuse and ensure child safety.  
The discussion centered on balancing family privacy with the need to protect children.

#### **House Bill 187: Restraining Orders for Minors**
House Bill 187 seeks to allow parents to file restraining orders on behalf of their minor children against individuals outside the household, addressing a gap in the current law where minors must file these orders themselves.  
- **Supporters** argued this change would better protect children, especially those who are young or have disabilities.  
- The committee voted **14-0** to pass the bill, with an amendment to make it effective immediately upon signing.

#### **House Bill 560: Parental Access to Minors’ Medical Records**
House Bill 560 addresses parental access to their children’s medical records, particularly electronic records via patient portals, once the child turns 13.  
- **Supporters** highlighted the need for parents to coordinate care effectively, especially for managing medications and follow-up appointments.  
- **Opponents**, including the New Hampshire Medical Society, raised concerns about compromising minors’ privacy, particularly in cases of abuse, neglect, or sensitive health issues (e.g., reproductive health, substance abuse).  
- **Technological limitations** in redacting sensitive information in electronic records were also discussed, with calls for further amendments to balance parental rights with minors’ privacy.

#### **House Bill 661: Federal Benefits for Foster Children**
House Bill 661 aims to ensure that federal benefits (e.g., Social Security, SSI) for children in foster care are conserved for their future use rather than being used to reimburse the state for foster care costs.  
- **Supporters**, including Representative Mary Jane Walner and advocates like Karen Rosenberg (Disability Rights Center), argued that preserving these benefits would improve outcomes for foster youth, particularly those aging out of the system, by providing financial stability for housing, education, and employment.  
- **Concerns** were raised about the financial implications for the state, as the current system uses these benefits to offset foster care costs.  
- The bill is expected to move to the finance committee for further discussion on funding and implementation.

#### **House Bill 652: Abolition of the Family Court**
House Bill 652 proposes abolishing the New Hampshire Family Court, citing systemic failures, lack of due process, and constitutional violations.  
- **Criticisms** of the Family Court included biased judges, punitive treatment of reporting parents, and the court’s tendency to prolong conflict rather than resolve it.  
- **Testimonies** highlighted cases of children being placed in unsafe environments with abusive parents, as well as the financial and emotional toll of prolonged litigation.  
- **Proposed reforms** included transferring cases to the Superior Court, introducing state-funded mediation services, and ensuring adherence to constitutional rights.  
- The meeting concluded with widespread support for reforming or abolishing the Family Court to protect families and ensure justice.
