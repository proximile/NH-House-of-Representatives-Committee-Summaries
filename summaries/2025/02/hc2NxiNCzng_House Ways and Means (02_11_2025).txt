**Summary of the New Hampshire House Ways and Means Committee Meeting on February 11, 2025**

The New Hampshire House Ways and Means Committee convened on February 11, 2025, to address a packed agenda, focusing primarily on revenue estimates for fiscal years 2025, 2026, and 2027, as well as discussions and votes on several key bills. The meeting highlighted the committee’s efforts to balance economic optimism with fiscal caution, ensuring accurate and responsible revenue projections while addressing legislative priorities.

### **Revenue Estimates and Economic Discussions**
The committee engaged in extensive discussions to finalize revenue estimates across various tax categories, including business taxes, interest and dividends, real estate transfer taxes, communication taxes, tobacco taxes, and meals and rooms taxes. Key points included:
- **Business Taxes**: The committee debated whether to use low, average, or high estimates, ultimately favoring conservative (lower) projections due to concerns about refunds, economic uncertainties, and businesses adapting to tax rate changes and credit carryover (CCO) limits. Refunds were noted to be decreasing but still significant.
- **Interest and Dividends**: Declining revenue was attributed to the timing of fiscal years versus tax years, and the committee accepted the provided numbers for fiscal years 2025, 2026, and 2027.
- **Real Estate Transfer Tax**: The committee considered gross numbers and the $5 million deduction for the affordable housing fund, deciding to use averages for estimates.
- **Communication Tax**: A decreasing trend due to the shift from landlines to data usage was noted, with averages used for estimates and slight adjustments for fiscal year 2025.
- **Tobacco Tax**: Trends were discussed, including health education and out-of-state sales, with averages used for estimates and a slight reduction for fiscal year 2025.
- **Meals and Rooms Tax**: The committee reviewed gross numbers, accounting for municipal transfers and school building aid, and used averages for estimates with specific numbers for fiscal years 2025, 2026, and 2027.

The committee emphasized aligning revenue projections with long-term GDP growth trends (around 2.5-3%) and agreed to revisit estimates after reviewing additional data. Discussions also touched on broader economic trends, such as low unemployment, housing shortages, labor availability, and wage growth, with some members expressing optimism about future growth while others urged caution due to potential economic fluctuations.

### **Bill Discussions and Votes**
The committee addressed several bills, with key outcomes as follows:
- **HB 596 FN**: Voted 16-4 to "ITL" (Inexpedient to Legislate) a bill imposing reporting requirements on entities collecting meals and rooms taxes, citing concerns about costs to small towns, competition, and privacy risks.
- **HB 635 FN**: Voted 11-9 to retain a bill addressing the taxation of nonprofit entities providing services to undocumented immigrants, as public hearings raised concerns requiring further discussion.
- **HB 530 FN**: Voted 11-9 to "ITL" a bill increasing revenue transfers from the real estate transfer tax to the affordable housing fund, due to concerns about the impact on the general and education trust funds and the need for housing solutions beyond subsidies.
- **HB 591 FN**: Voted 16-4 to "OTP" (Ought to Pass) a bill expanding Keno gaming hours on weekends, with the lottery anticipating increased revenue from this change.

### **Next Steps**
The committee planned to finalize revenue estimates and resolutions at their next meeting on February 19, 2025, with a backup meeting scheduled for February 21 in case of snow. Public hearings for other bills were set for the following day.

### **Overall Tone and Acknowledgment**
The session concluded with acknowledgments of the committee’s efficiency and progress in addressing the agenda. Members balanced optimism about economic recovery with caution in revenue projections, particularly in light of refund trends and broader economic uncertainties. Political perspectives occasionally surfaced, with one representative expressing optimism about economic growth under a potential Trump administration and another highlighting wage growth and inflation trends under the current administration.

In summary, the meeting underscored the committee’s commitment to fiscal responsibility, thoughtful deliberation, and addressing both immediate and long-term economic and legislative priorities.
