The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Committee meeting on February 11, 2025, addressed several key legislative issues, including healthcare contract enforcement, the Patient Bill of Rights, and waste management funding. Below is a comprehensive summary of the discussions:

### Healthcare Contracts and Patient Bill of Rights Enforcement

1. **Proposed Amendment to Healthcare Contracts**:
   - The committee discussed an amendment aimed at enforcing compliance with the **Patient Bill of Rights** (RSA 151:21) by prohibiting the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) from contracting with hospitals found in violation. This amendment was introduced in response to a high-profile case where a patient was denied a kidney transplant for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine, which violated the Patient Bill of Rights.
   - **Robert Moore**, DHHS Contracts Director, clarified that there are **23-24 active contracts** with **6-7 hospitals**, all of which include provisions requiring compliance with state laws, including the Patient Bill of Rights.

2. **Enforcement and Concerns**:
   - **Melissa Blasek** testified about the challenges patients face in enforcing their rights, often requiring significant public and legal pressure. The amendment seeks to provide a legislative enforcement mechanism, as current enforcement relies on court action, which is slow and inefficient.
   - Representatives from **Dartmouth Health** and the **New Hampshire Hospital Association** expressed concerns about the amendment’s scope and potential unintended consequences, such as disrupting critical services like Medicaid and mental health care.

3. **Legislative Process**:
   - The committee raised questions about how violations would be determined, whether corrective actions would be allowed before contract termination, and how the amendment would apply to existing contracts. A tentative work session was proposed for Friday morning to further review the amendment.

### Governor’s Budget Presentation

- The committee prepared for a presentation by the governor on the budget, scheduled for Friday afternoon, with additional time for questions from the budget director.

### Waste Management Funding (House Bill 619)

1. **Bill Overview**:
   - **House Bill 619** proposes a **$1 million appropriation** to the **Solid Waste Management Fund**, which supports municipalities and businesses in waste diversion efforts, particularly **food waste**, which constitutes **25-30% of landfill waste**.
   - The bill aims to help New Hampshire achieve its **waste diversion goals** of **25% by 2030** and **45% by 2050**.

2. **Municipal Challenges and Solutions**:
   - Municipalities face **high costs** for waste management, including **tipping fees** (around **$60-$100 per ton**). Programs like **composting** can reduce costs and extend landfill capacity.
   - **New London** successfully implemented a composting program, diverting **32 tons of food waste** in 2024. **Private businesses and farms** also benefit from composting, turning waste into **usable soil** or **energy** through anaerobic digesters.

3. **Funding and Alternatives**:
   - The committee discussed **alternative funding mechanisms**, such as a **$1-$2 per ton search charge** on waste, which could generate **$2-$4 million annually** to support waste reduction efforts.
   - Other states, like **Iowa** and **Vermont**, use similar charges to fund recycling and waste diversion programs.

4. **Education and Outreach**:
   - The **Department of Environmental Services (DES)** is working on **education and outreach** to support waste reduction efforts. While education is important, **convenience** is a major factor in waste diversion. Programs like **curbside pickup** or **municipal composting** make it easier for residents to participate.

5. **Food Waste Ban**:
   - A **food waste ban** for large generators (over **1 ton per week**) took effect recently, requiring them to divert food waste from landfills if facilities are within **25 miles**.

### Conclusion

The meeting highlighted the complexity of the proposed healthcare contract amendment and the need for further discussion to address concerns and ensure clarity before moving forward. Additionally, the committee explored significant funding and policy measures to support New Hampshire’s waste management goals, emphasizing the importance of **funding**, **education**, and **infrastructure** to achieve long-term sustainability in waste reduction efforts.
