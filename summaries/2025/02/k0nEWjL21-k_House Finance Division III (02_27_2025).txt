The New Hampshire House of Representatives recently held a series of meetings focused on behavioral health, homelessness prevention, substance misuse, recovery programs, and related funding challenges. These discussions highlighted the state's multifaceted approach to addressing mental health and substance use disorders, improving crisis response systems, and supporting vulnerable populations. Below is a cohesive summary of the key themes and initiatives discussed across the meetings:

### **Mental Health Services and Crisis Response**
1. **Mission Zero Initiative**: This state initiative aims to eliminate emergency department boarding for individuals awaiting mental health services. Significant progress has been made through investments in certified community behavioral health clinics (CCBHCs), crisis stabilization centers, and expanded housing. These efforts have reduced wait times and improved access to care.
2. **Crisis Services**: The state has integrated mental health and substance use crisis services, including mobile crisis units and rapid response centers. The 988 Suicide Prevention Lifeline provides 24/7 access to crisis support, with technical assistance from UNH.
3. **Residential Treatment and Community Care**: Residential treatment programs for children and youth were reviewed, with a focus on transitioning individuals from residential to community-based care. Programs like Fast Forward (ages 5–21) and Early Childhood Wraparound (birth to 5) provide community-based support and care coordination.
4. **Suicide Prevention**: The Suicide Prevention Council tracks suicide data and issues annual reports to inform prevention efforts. The state emphasizes the importance of understanding trends and improving intervention strategies.

### **Housing and Homelessness**
1. **Supportive Housing**: The state has expanded supportive housing, including recovery housing, to address homelessness and mental health needs. Programs like landlord incentives and bridge subsidies help individuals transition from inpatient care to stable housing.
2. **Point-in-Time Count**: An annual count tracks homelessness to allocate resources effectively. Recent data shows an increase in unsheltered individuals due to the winding down of a federal housing program.
3. **Homelessness Prevention**: Rental assistance and supportive services are critical to preventing homelessness. Data on program exits to permanent housing was reviewed, with efforts to eliminate duplication in reporting.

### **Substance Misuse Prevention and Recovery**
1. **State Opioid Response**: The state has strategically located "Doorways" for easy access to substance misuse services, with after-hours support available. Programs focus on reducing overdose deaths and standardizing services.
2. **Overdose Prevention**: The distribution of naloxone (Narcan) and access to medication for addiction treatment have contributed to a reduction in overdose deaths. Fentanyl remains a significant concern, but naloxone is effective in treating fentanyl overdoses.
3. **Recovery Programs**: Peer recovery support programs, recovery residences, and recovery-friendly workplaces are key components of the state’s strategy. Recovery-friendly workplaces help businesses support employees in recovery, reducing absenteeism and job loss.
4. **School-Based Prevention Programs**: The state supports voluntary substance misuse prevention programs in schools, with a focus on middle and high schools. A pilot program at UNH aims to address substance misuse among college students, with plans for expansion.

### **Funding and Budgetary Challenges**
1. **Medicaid Concerns**: Medicaid funds are critical for many mental health and substance use programs. Representatives expressed concerns about potential Medicaid changes, such as increased copays and work requirements, which could lead to more uncompensated care.
2. **Unfunded Programs**: Several programs, including the Children's Behavioral Health Resource Center and rate increases for residential programs, are unfunded in the current budget. Ten positions across the Division of Behavioral Health remain unfunded, impacting service delivery.
3. **Opioid Settlement Funds**: The state manages settlement funds from lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies through the Opioid Abatement Trust Fund. These funds are allocated to address the opioid crisis, with investments in housing and community programs.
4. **Federal and State Grants**: The state relies on federal and state grants to fund critical programs. Multi-year contracts and performance metrics ensure accountability and effective use of resources.

### **Data-Driven Decision-Making and Workforce Challenges**
1. **Data Collection**: The state emphasizes the importance of data collection to measure the impact of services. Programs like Fast Forward and Early Childhood Wraparound have shown steady growth in enrollment and referrals.
2. **Behavioral Health Workforce**: The state is part of the New Hampshire Healthcare Workforce Coalition, advocating for a 3% rate increase for Medicaid providers to address workforce shortages.
3. **Uncompensated Care**: Community Mental Health Centers face significant uncompensated care costs, particularly from commercial insurers. There is a call for increased funding and better coordination with insurers.

### **Community and Peer Support**
1. **Peer Certification Program**: The state provides training and certification for peer support workers, who play a vital role in recovery and reintegration efforts.
2. **Critical Time Intervention (CTI)**: The CTI program supports individuals transitioning from acute care to the community, reducing readmissions by addressing basic needs and providing care coordination.
3. **Guardianship Services**: The state provides guardianship services for individuals who cannot make decisions for themselves, though funding for these services is a concern.

### **Public Comment and Advocacy**
Representatives from organizations like New Futures emphasized the importance of continued funding for the Governor’s Commission on Alcohol and Other Drugs and the children’s behavioral health system. They highlighted the need for sustained support for prevention, treatment, and recovery services.

### **Conclusion**
The meetings underscored the state’s commitment to improving mental health and substance use services, addressing homelessness, and ensuring funding for critical programs. While significant progress has been made, challenges remain, including budget constraints, workforce shortages, and the need for sustainable funding models. The state continues to prioritize data-driven decision-making, community-based care, and comprehensive support systems to meet the evolving needs of its residents.
