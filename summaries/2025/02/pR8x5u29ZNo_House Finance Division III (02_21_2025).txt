The New Hampshire House of Representatives Finance Committee, Division Three, held a series of work sessions in February 2025 focused on the state’s Medicaid program, its budget, and related policy changes. These sessions addressed a wide range of topics, including Medicaid funding, program administration, federal and state policy impacts, and specific initiatives aimed at improving healthcare access and outcomes for vulnerable populations. Below is a cohesive summary of the key discussions:

### **Budget and Funding Overview**
The Medicaid budget was a central focus, with detailed discussions on the governor’s proposed budget, which includes adjustments to Medicaid funding levels. The budget features a carry-forward provision allowing Medicaid to retain unspent funds from previous years, critical for managing the program’s multi-billion-dollar scale. The adjusted authorized amount for Medicaid is $1.3 billion, with significant changes in funding levels between fiscal years. There was also a $70 million discrepancy between the Department of Health and Human Services’ budget and the governor’s budget, including $60 million in reductions and $10 million in off-budget items related to the Granite Advantage Health Care Program. The return to regular eligibility redeterminations post-COVID-19 is expected to save $5.7 million in fiscal year 2026 and $11.4 million in 2027.

### **Program Administration and Policy Changes**
The sessions highlighted several Medicaid programs and policy adjustments:
- **Granite Advantage Health Care Program**: This program serves approximately 50,000 individuals, with concerns raised about its potential expiration if federal funding drops below 90%. This would impact 7.2% of the state’s population.
- **Medicaid to Schools Program**: This program supports children with medical or disability conditions in schools and is transitioning to a new federal claiming methodology by July 1, 2026.
- **Adult Dental Program**: Funded through a settlement with an MCO, this program has expanded to include over 90 dentists and mobile services, particularly benefiting nursing home residents.
- **Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP)**: CHIP is adapting to new federal requirements, including continuous 12-month coverage for children, and introducing premiums for families above 25% of the poverty level, capped at 5% of family income.
- **Maternal Opioid Misuse Model**: A pilot program in the greater Manchester area, helping mothers and children affected by opioids, is set to conclude at the end of 2025.

### **Federal and State Policy Impacts**
The unwinding of the continuous coverage provision from the COVID-19 pandemic has led to the completion of redeterminations for 238,000 individuals, with 30,000 done early to manage workload. Outreach efforts have resulted in 11,000 individuals voluntarily closing their Medicaid cases. The potential reintroduction of work requirements for Medicaid recipients was discussed, though it would involve additional administrative costs. Federal policy changes, including shifts in match rates and funding levels, were also emphasized, with concerns about how federal budget cuts could affect services.

### **Reimbursement Rates and Cost Management**
Medicaid reimbursement rates and cost management strategies were a recurring theme. Discussions included:
- **Prescription Drug Costs**: Rising costs, particularly for expensive gene therapies, were addressed through rebates, utilization criteria, and promoting generic drug use.
- **Managed Care and Provider Rates**: Adjustments to Medicaid rates and managed care contracts were discussed to ensure hospital solvency, with a focus on critical access hospitals.
- **Uncompensated Care (UCC)**: Funds have shifted from traditional UCC to other Medicaid services to maximize federal matching funds, driven by federal changes reducing UCC allocations.

### **Transparency and Public Input**
Concerns were raised about the lack of transparency regarding Medicaid policy changes, particularly a five-point document outlining potential changes. The delayed release of the trailer bill (House Bill 2), now expected by March 1, added to these frustrations. Public input was emphasized, with calls for more opportunities to comment on proposed changes and clearer information on implementation costs, particularly regarding premiums and co-pays.

### **IT and System Optimization**
Investments in Medicaid information systems were highlighted, including modularity and the use of technology like AI to enhance efficiency and fraud detection. These improvements aim to streamline operations and improve data accuracy.

### **Provider and Community Impact**
The sessions briefly touched on the impact of Medicaid changes on healthcare providers, including hospitals and substance use disorder treatment centers. However, there was a suggestion to dedicate more time to this topic in future meetings. Community programs like the Adult Community Re-entry Program, which connects individuals to mental health and substance use disorder services before release to reduce recidivism, were also discussed.

### **Upcoming Meetings and Future Discussions**
The committee announced upcoming work sessions for the Division of Children, Youth, and Families on February 26th and the Division of Behavioral Health on February 27th. The sessions concluded with a commitment to continue detailed discussions on Medicaid policies and budgetary impacts in future meetings.

### **Conclusion**
The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ work sessions underscored the complexity of Medicaid funding and administration, balancing cost management with the need to provide adequate healthcare services. The discussions highlighted the importance of collaboration with federal and state entities, transparency in policy changes, and the need to address the evolving needs of vulnerable populations. Efforts to optimize Medicaid programs, manage costs, and improve healthcare access and outcomes remain ongoing priorities.
