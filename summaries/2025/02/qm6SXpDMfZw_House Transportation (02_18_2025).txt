The New Hampshire House of Representatives Transportation Committee meeting on February 18, 2025, addressed a wide range of bills related to transportation, public safety, and vehicle regulations. The discussions were marked by debates over public safety, individual rights, and the role of government regulation. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key bills and discussions:

### **Airport Operations and Noise Abatement**
- **House Bill 758**: Proposed the establishment of a committee to study airport operation hours, focusing on noise abatement measures and potential flight restrictions between 12:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. The committee would include House and Senate members and engage with stakeholders. The New Hampshire Department of Transportation’s Bureau of Aeronautics noted that 12 federally funded airports must remain open during these hours, and cargo operations, particularly at Manchester Airport, could be impacted.

### **Emergency Worker Safety**
- **House Bill 489**: Aimed to allow volunteer emergency workers to use rear-facing blue lights on their private vehicles during emergencies to improve visibility and safety. Concerns were raised about potential confusion with law enforcement vehicles, but proponents emphasized the need for enhanced safety for volunteers.

### **Vehicle Inspections and Compliance**
- **House Bill 533**: Authorized the use of civilian automotive equipment inspectors for certain inspections and allowed certified law enforcement officers to enter commercial premises for compliance reviews and safety audits. Clarifications were made that civilian inspectors would not conduct commercial motor vehicle inspections.
- **House Bill 649**: Sought to eliminate mandatory vehicle safety inspections and onboard diagnostic tests, citing concerns about unnecessary costs and government overreach. The committee voted to pass the bill, though some members favored retaining it for further refinement. Earlier in the meeting, a motion to pass the bill failed with an 8-8 vote, and a subsequent motion to retain the bill also failed with an 8-8 vote, meaning the bill will proceed to the full House with no recommendation.

### **Driving with a Suspended License**
- **House Bill 594**: Addressed the definition of a "way" in the context of driving with a suspended license, clarifying that operating a motor vehicle on private property, such as mowing a lawn, should not be subject to the same penalties as driving on public roads.

### **Medical Accommodations for Veterans**
- **House Bill 632**: Permitted healthcare providers affiliated with the Veterans Administration (VA) to certify medical accommodations for veterans residing in New Hampshire. The bill aimed to close a loophole that disqualified VA providers from certifying medical accommodations, ensuring veterans can access necessary accommodations without needing to seek private practitioners. The bill received broad support from VA officials.

### **Driver’s Licenses for Non-Resident Aliens**
- **House Bill 452**: Proposed restricting the issuance and renewal of driver’s licenses to non-U.S. citizens who cannot prove lawful permanent residency. Supporters argued it ensures only legally authorized individuals receive licenses, while opponents claimed it creates unnecessary barriers for legally present individuals, such as asylum seekers, temporary workers, students, and families. The committee voted 9-7 in favor of passing the bill, with a Minority Report expected for further debate.

### **Personal Electric Vehicles and Traffic Enforcement**
- **House Bill 7115**: Addressed regulations for personal electric vehicles, including enforcement and age requirements for operators. The committee recommended the bill as "inexpedient to legislate" with a 14-2 vote, effectively rejecting it.
- **House Bill 305**: Proposed the use of speed and red light cameras for traffic enforcement. Privacy concerns and the cost of implementation were major points of contention. The committee voted 13-3 to recommend the bill as "inexpedient to legislate."

### **Antique Vehicles and Headlight Use**
- **House Bill 390**: Sought to add retired fire apparatus to antique vehicle exemptions, allowing them to be used in parades and shows. The committee overwhelmingly supported the bill, voting 15-1 to recommend it for passage.
- **House Bill 419**: Required vehicle headlights to be on when windshield wipers are in use. While some members supported it as a safety measure, others argued it was unnecessary and could lead to unnecessary citations. The committee voted 10-6 to recommend the bill as "inexpedient to legislate."

### **Other Bills**
- **House Bill 209**: Retained for further work, allowing new vehicles to skip inspections in the second year after purchase.
- **House Bill 439**: Retained to address issues with non-driving-related license suspensions.

### **Conclusion**
The meeting highlighted the committee’s focus on balancing public safety, individual rights, and government regulation. The discussions revealed significant divisions on issues such as vehicle inspections, driver’s licenses for non-resident aliens, and traffic enforcement. The meeting concluded with plans for a final executive session on March 4th to address remaining house bills before the crossover period. Members were reminded to submit their reports promptly.
