The NH House of Representatives meeting on February 14, 2025, focused on discussing and voting on several bills related to fish, game, and marine resources. Key points from the meeting include:

1. **Bill 589 Discussion**: Members debated a bill (HB 589) addressing hunting contests and wanton waste. Concerns were raised about the bill's wording, particularly the term "reasonable," which was deemed flawed. It was suggested that the Fish and Game Commission handle these issues through rule-making rather than legislation, as rules offer more flexibility and can be adjusted more quickly.

2. **Hunting Contests and Wanton Waste**: There was significant discussion about whether hunting contests should be regulated directly or through existing wanton waste rules. Some members supported banning killing contests, while others believed they could be regulated indirectly through wanton waste rules.

3. **Public Input and Transparency**: Members emphasized the importance of public input in the rule-making process, though it was noted that public input is not legally required except for land sales. The Fish and Game Commission was praised for its public outreach and transparency.

4. **Bill 22 Discussion**: Another bill (HB 22) was debated, which proposed changing the Fish and Game Commission's role to advisory only. This was met with strong opposition, as members argued that the Commission's authority is crucial for effective oversight and governance of the department. The analogy of a board of directors overseeing a CEO was used to highlight the importance of the Commission's current role.

5. **Voting and Consent**: Both bills were voted on, with HB 589 passing with a 12-3 vote and HB 22 passing with a 14-1 vote. Both bills were recommended for consent unless any member objected.

6. **Efficiency and Governance**: Members stressed the need for efficient governance and the importance of the Fish and Game Commission's authority in representing the interests of hunters, anglers, and trappers across the state.

7. **Future Actions**: The committee concluded its work on the discussed bills and planned to address any remaining issues after the crossover period at the end of March.

The meeting ended with a light-hearted motion for a member to buy lunch for the committee, and members were reminded of the importance of their work and the need for continued efficiency and public engagement.
