The New Hampshire House of Representatives held several meetings addressing a range of legislative issues, including disaster relief funding, EpiPen availability in schools, temporary driver’s licenses for youth, and the budget and operations of the New Hampshire Police Standards and Training (PST) organization. Here’s a cohesive summary of the key discussions:

### **Disaster Relief Funding (HB 165)**
Representative Judy Aron introduced **HB 165**, which seeks to increase the maximum disaster relief funding for municipalities from $25,000 to $100,000. The bill aims to correct a previous reduction in funding and expedite financial assistance to communities affected by natural disasters. Aron highlighted the challenges faced by towns like Acworth, which experienced severe flooding in 2021 and 2023, and emphasized the need for a statutory mechanism to provide timely aid. The bill also clarifies language to avoid confusion with other disaster relief funds. Discussions touched on potential funding sources and the need for clarity on reimbursement processes, with the fiscal note indicating limited funds available.

### **EpiPen Availability in Schools (HB 677)**
Representative Drago presented **HB 677**, which requires schools to maintain a supply of EpiPens for emergency use. The bill passed the education committee unanimously and was placed on the consent calendar. Schools can obtain EpiPens for free through programs like "EpiPen for Schools," which provides four doses annually, with free replacements if used. The bill also includes provisions for FDA-approved nasal epinephrine sprays. An amendment was proposed to replace "may" with "shall" to strengthen the requirement. The Department of Education sought clarification on funding responsibilities, as the bill mentions a $1 appropriation for reimbursement but also references free supplies from companies. The committee voted 7-0 to amend the bill, removing the reimbursement and appropriation sections while maintaining the requirement for schools to apply for free epinephrine supplies and submit annual reports.

### **Temporary Driver’s Licenses for Youth (HB 612)**
Representative Stephanie Grund, speaking on behalf of Representative Vu, introduced **HB 612**, which allows youth operators to renew their licenses up to 30 days before turning 21 and receive a temporary license valid until their birthday. This addresses issues when birthdays fall on weekends or holidays, preventing the need for multiple DMV visits. The bill aims to reduce inconvenience for drivers and workload for DMV staff. The DMV director supported the bill, noting it resolves a long-standing issue. The one-time system update cost is estimated at $48,000, which the DMV will cover within its budget.

### **New Hampshire Police Standards and Training (PST) Budget and Operations**
The PST director, John Skippa, outlined the organization's mission to enhance the competency and professionalism of law enforcement in New Hampshire. PST operates independently, setting hiring, educational, and accountability standards for police, corrections, and probation officers. It also runs various training academies, including full-time and part-time police academies, corrections academies, and court security officer training programs.

**Budget Requests and Adjustments**:
- A 0.94% decrease in the governor's recommended budget for FY26.
- Request to defund a full-time administrative position and reallocate funds to support an IT manager position.
- Adjustments for contractual maintenance and software upgrades, including a new records management system.

**Statutory and Rule Changes**:
- Clarifying the definition of police misconduct.
- Authorizing the appointment of temporary members to the Conduct Review Committee.
- Updating requirements for reporting allegations of police misconduct.
- Establishing the Law Enforcement Accreditation Commission in statute.

**Training Programs and Recruitment**:
PST discussed its training programs, including Crisis Intervention Training (CIT) and the challenges of recruitment and retention, particularly for corrections officers. The organization highlighted its efforts to adapt training schedules and class sizes to meet demand.

**Disciplinary Hearings and Transparency**:
PST emphasized its role in overseeing disciplinary hearings for officers accused of misconduct. The organization has a process for publicly publishing sustained findings of misconduct, replacing the outdated "Laurie List" with a more transparent system.

**Legislative Process and HB2**:
Representatives discussed the legislative process for PST's requested changes, including the governor's trailer bill (HB2) and separate legislation (HB777 and HB778) related to accreditation and conduct review committees. PST clarified that some changes were initially proposed for HB2 but were later pursued through separate bills.

**Questions and Clarifications**:
Representatives asked for detailed explanations of budget line items, including increases in compensation, maintenance costs, and equipment expenses. PST provided context for these changes, such as reclassifying positions and transitioning to new software systems.

### **Conclusion**
Overall, the meetings focused on legislative efforts to improve disaster response, school safety, and DMV efficiency, with detailed discussions on funding, implementation, and potential amendments. The PST meeting highlighted the organization's budget, operational challenges, and legislative requests, with representatives seeking clarity on specific financial and policy changes. The House of Representatives adjourned with plans to continue discussions in upcoming sessions.
