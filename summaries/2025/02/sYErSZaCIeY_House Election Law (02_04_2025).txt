**Comprehensive Summary of NH House of Representatives Meeting on Election Law (February 4, 2025)**

The New Hampshire House of Representatives convened on February 4, 2025, to discuss a series of bills and constitutional amendments related to election law, with a particular focus on absentee voting, election security, and voter accessibility. The meeting highlighted significant debates and testimonies from representatives, election officials, advocacy groups, and the public, reflecting tensions between ensuring election integrity and maintaining voter access.

### **Absentee Voting and Ballot Processing**
1. **Absentee Ballot Requests and Timing**:
   - **HB 288**: Introduced by Representative Robert Wuerpel, this bill proposed requiring absentee ballot requests to be submitted at least six months before an election. Supporters argued this would streamline administration and reduce errors, citing data showing 2% of absentee ballots in the 2024 election were requested more than six months in advance. Critics, including Representative Timothy Horan, argued the bill could disenfranchise voters needing flexibility.
   - **HB 498**: Aimed to restrict the Secretary of State from sending absentee ballot applications more than 45 days before an election. Opponents argued this would cause logistical challenges for voters abroad or those with changing addresses.

2. **Absentee Ballot Processing and Counting**:
   - **HB 294**: Sought to remove a provision allowing 10 or more voters to petition to delay absentee ballot processing until after polls close, which often delayed election results. Supporters, including Representative Gary Daniels and moderators from Milford, Londonderry, and Derry, emphasized the inefficiency and burden this caused.
   - **HB 344**: Proposed allowing pre-processing of absentee ballot outer envelopes up to one week before Election Day to identify and rectify issues (e.g., unsigned affidavits) in advance. Supporters, including the New Hampshire Campaign for Voting Rights, highlighted benefits such as voter access, efficiency, and transparency.

3. **Absentee Ballot Verification and Security**:
   - **HB 608**: Required absentee ballot affidavits to be notarized or verified by an authorized official. Proponents argued this would ensure election integrity by verifying voter identity, similar to in-person voting. Critics, including advocacy groups like AEL New Hampshire, argued it would create barriers for voters, particularly those with disabilities or limited access to notaries.
   - **HB 686**: Proposed requiring voters to provide a notarized application and a color copy of a government-issued photo ID for absentee ballots. Supporters, including Representative Kelly Pender, argued this would enhance election security, while opponents, including the League of Women Voters, called it a "poll tax" that could disenfranchise low-income and rural voters.

### **Election Security and Accessibility**
1. **Voter ID and Verification**:
   - **HB 217**: Proposed requiring additional documentation for absentee voting, which critics argued would create undue burdens for individuals with disabilities, low-income voters, and others reliant on absentee voting.
   - **HB 626**: Proposed a vulnerability disclosure program for election systems, with an amendment ensuring vulnerabilities are addressed before disclosure. The bill passed unanimously.

2. **Deepfake Political Advertisements**:
   - **HB 630**: Aimed to prevent the dissemination of deepfake materials of political candidates. The bill sparked debate, with some arguing it closed a loophole for false propaganda, while others opposed it. The motion to deem it inexpedient to legislate passed 10-7.

3. **Weather Conditions and Absentee Voting**:
   - **HB 403**: Proposed allowing absentee voting due to severe weather conditions, expanding the definition to include any National Weather Service warning or watch. The bill aimed to ensure voter safety and accessibility.

### **Constitutional Amendments and Procedural Matters**
1. **CACR 5**: Proposed a constitutional amendment to allow no-excuse absentee voting, aligning New Hampshire with 37 other states. Supporters, including Representative Connie Lane, argued it would improve voter access, while opponents raised concerns about election security and potential federal law conflicts.
2. **CACR 3 and CACR 4**: Addressed recall elections and voting eligibility, respectively. CACR 3 was deemed inexpedient to legislate, while CACR 4 was retained for further discussion.
3. **HB 327**: Simplified the process for filing for office by allowing candidates to file at their Town Clerk’s office or the Secretary of State’s office. The bill passed unanimously with the amendment.

### **Key Themes and Outcomes**
- **Accessibility vs. Security**: The meeting centered on balancing voter access with election integrity, with significant debate over the impact of proposed ID and notarization requirements on vulnerable populations.
- **Public Support and Opposition**: Many bills, including CACR 5 and HB 344, received broad support for enhancing voter access, while others, like HB 608 and HB 686, faced opposition due to concerns about disenfranchisement.
- **Historical Context and Practical Concerns**: Discussions frequently referenced past elections, particularly the 2020 COVID-19 election, to highlight the need for legislative changes and address logistical challenges.

The meeting concluded with the committee moving forward on several bills, emphasizing transparency, voter confidence, and election integrity. The session underscored the ongoing efforts to refine New Hampshire’s election laws to better serve its citizens while maintaining the security and integrity of the electoral process.
