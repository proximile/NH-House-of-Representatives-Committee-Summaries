### **Key Bills and Discussions**

1. **HB 542 (Unemployment Compensation Weekly Benefits)**  
   - The committee recessed the hearing due to the need for more information, rescheduling it for the following week.

2. **HB 442 (Prohibiting Subminimum Wages)**  
   - The bill sought to eliminate subminimum wages, particularly in the restaurant industry. Supporters argued it would ensure fair wages, while opponents claimed it could harm small businesses and tipped workers. The motion to declare the bill "inexpedient to legislate" (ITL) passed 11-9.

3. **HB 726 (State Minimum Wage)**  
   - The bill proposed raising the state minimum wage to $15 an hour. Proponents argued it would help low-wage workers, while opponents warned of potential unemployment for low-skilled workers. The ITL motion passed 11-9.

4. **HB 378 (Unused Employee Time)**  
   - The bill aimed to regulate payouts for unused leave. Critics argued it would complicate accounting and burden employers. The ITL motion passed, with concerns about retroactive application.

5. **HB 386 (Prohibiting Non-Compete Clauses in Nursing Contracts)**  
   - The bill sought to eliminate non-compete clauses in nursing contracts, which restrict nurses from working directly for healthcare facilities after being placed by an agency. Supporters argued it would increase nurse mobility and reduce costs for healthcare organizations, while opponents raised concerns about the impact on staffing agencies. Testimony from nurses and agency representatives highlighted the tension between protecting investments and ensuring fair labor practices.

6. **HB 248 (State Employee Investigations)**  
   - This bill aimed to ensure state employees receive proper notice and updates during suspensions or investigations. The committee debated aligning the bill with existing collective bargaining agreements and extending protections to all state employees.

7. **HB 280 (Payment Methods for Employees)**  
   - The bill proposed allowing employers more flexibility in wage payment methods (e.g., payroll cards, checks) while requiring written notice to employees. Concerns were raised about non-traditional payment methods (e.g., barter or commodities) and enforcement challenges. The Department of Labor emphasized the need for clarity and employee protections.

8. **HB 487 (Predictive Scheduling)**  
   - The bill required employers to provide hourly employees with at least 7 days' notice of their work schedules. Supporters argued it would improve work-life balance, while opponents from industries like construction and hospitality cited the need for flexibility due to unpredictable demands. Amendments were suggested to address industry-specific concerns.

9. **HB 379 (Youth Labor Laws)**  
   - The bill proposed restricting work hours for youth under 16, limiting work past 9:00 PM on weekdays and 11:00 PM on weekends during the school year. Concerns were raised about inconsistencies between state and federal laws and the challenges of enforcement. The bill aimed to prioritize education and well-being for young workers.

10. **HB 757 (Tip Pooling and Service Charges)**  
    - The bill mandated written agreements for tip-sharing arrangements and clarified that service charges are not tips. The Lodging and Restaurant Association opposed the bill, citing administrative burdens and potential confusion. Discussions focused on transparency, enforcement, and aligning state laws with federal standards.
