The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting on February 4, 2025, focused on several key bills related to family law, child welfare, and court transparency. The discussions highlighted the complexities of balancing legal protections, privacy concerns, and systemic accountability. Below is a cohesive summary of the key bills and debates:

---

### **House Bill 243: Penalties for False Reports of Child Abuse and Neglect**
The committee debated **House Bill 243**, which proposed civil or criminal penalties for false reports of child abuse or neglect made to the Division for Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF).  
- **Support**: Proponents argued that the bill would deter malicious reports and protect individuals from unfounded allegations, noting that existing laws already criminalize false reports to law enforcement.  
- **Opposition**: Critics expressed concern that the bill might discourage legitimate reports of abuse, fearing penalties could deter well-meaning individuals. They also highlighted the difficulty of identifying anonymous malicious reporters.  
- **Outcome**: The motion to pass the bill (OTP) failed (7-9), and the motion to kill the bill (ITL) passed (10-6), effectively ending its consideration.

### **House Bill 335: Counseling and Psychological Evaluations in Custody Cases**
**House Bill 335** addressed issues in family court, particularly the ordering of counseling and psychological evaluations in custody cases.  
- **Support**: Some representatives and constituents shared personal stories of unfair practices, such as being ordered to pay for counseling despite financial hardship. They argued the bill would address these inequities.  
- **Opposition**: Opponents, including professional organizations like the National Association of Social Workers, argued the bill could harm children by mandating invasive evaluations and failing to address systemic issues. They also criticized the bill for potentially relying on the debunked concept of Parental Alienation Syndrome.  
- **Concerns**: Critics raised issues about coercion, trauma, and the financial burden on families, particularly domestic violence survivors.  
- **Next Steps**: The committee agreed to revisit the bill in two weeks, with members encouraged to propose amendments.

### **House Bill 486: Grandparents' Visitation Rights**
**House Bill 486** focused on grandparents' rights to visitation in cases involving divorce, separation, or parental issues like substance abuse.  
- **Support**: Grandparents testified about being alienated from their grandchildren, emphasizing the emotional harm to both parties.  
- **Legal Concerns**: Current laws were criticized for technical barriers, such as requiring a formal divorce decree, which often prevents grandparents from seeking visitation.  
- **Proposed Changes**: Suggestions included expanding the law to cover cases of separation and preventing parents from using the law to cut off contact.  
- **Committee Discussion**: Members considered amendments to address these issues and ensure a fair legal framework.

### **House Bill 320: Enforcement of Marital Property Settlements**
**House Bill 320** aimed to close a legal gap by requiring courts to enforce final marital property settlements.  
- **Background**: Currently, courts have no statutory obligation to enforce these settlements, leaving parties without recourse if agreements are violated.  
- **Proposal**: The bill would allow courts to enforce settlements based on preponderance of evidence, with valid defenses such as fraud or duress.  
- **Committee Discussion**: Members questioned the distinction between enforcement and contempt, with the sponsor emphasizing the need for clarity and predictability in the legal process.

### **House Bill 350: Recording and Broadcasting Family Court Proceedings**
**House Bill 350** proposed audio and video recording of Family Court proceedings to increase transparency and accountability.  
- **Transparency vs. Privacy**: Supporters argued that recordings would improve judicial accountability and aid in appeals, while opponents raised concerns about privacy, particularly for children and domestic violence survivors.  
- **Cost and Logistics**: Concerns were raised about the affordability of transcripts and the availability of qualified professionals for risk assessments.  
- **Amendments**: Suggestions included limiting live broadcasts, allowing redactions, or piloting the program in one courthouse before statewide implementation.  
- **Other States**: Representatives noted that some states, like Nevada and Kentucky, already allow recordings, which could serve as a model for New Hampshire.  
- **Opposition**: Advocates for domestic violence victims argued that broadcasting sensitive cases could deter survivors from seeking protection orders.

### **House Bill 213: Wage Garnishment for Child Support**
The committee briefly discussed **House Bill 213**, which addressed wage garnishment for child support.  
- **Fiscal Impact**: The bill was confirmed to have no additional costs, as expenses could be absorbed within existing budgets.  
- **Outcome**: The bill passed unanimously (15-0) and was placed on the consent calendar.
