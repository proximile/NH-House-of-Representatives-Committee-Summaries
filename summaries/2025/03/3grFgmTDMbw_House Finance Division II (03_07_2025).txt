The New Hampshire House of Representatives recently held several meetings addressing key legislative issues, including education funding programs, public transportation, and public safety. These discussions highlighted the state’s efforts to balance fiscal responsibility with the need to support essential services and programs for its residents. Below is a cohesive summary of the key topics covered across the meetings:

---

### **Education Funding and Programs**
The House of Representatives focused on two primary education funding initiatives: the **Education Tax Credit (ETC)** program and the **Education Freedom Account (EFA)** program.

1. **Education Tax Credit (ETC) Program**:
   - Established in 2012, the ETC program provides scholarships to students, funded by donations from businesses that receive an 85% tax credit.
   - The program serves approximately 827 students annually, with scholarships totaling around $2.4 million. It primarily targets low-income families and students transitioning from public to private schools.
   - Accountability measures include requiring families to provide standardized test scores or portfolio evaluations to demonstrate educational progress.

2. **Education Freedom Account (EFA) Program**:
   - Enacted in 2021, the EFA program allows families to use state education funds for private school tuition, homeschooling, tutoring, or other approved educational expenses.
   - Eligibility is open to families earning up to 350% of the federal poverty level. Funds are drawn from the state’s Education Trust Fund.
   - Accountability is ensured through annual standardized test scores or portfolio evaluations. Non-compliance results in the suspension of EFA funds.
   - The program allows flexibility for students to participate in part-time public school programs (e.g., AP classes, art, or music) while being full-time EFA participants.

**Key Discussions**:
   - Legislators emphasized the need for accountability and compliance, particularly for homeschoolers.
   - Concerns were raised about the potential for dual funding, as the state’s student information system (i4c/idex) ensures EFA participants are not simultaneously enrolled full-time in public schools.
   - The committee discussed legislative options, including amending **HB 494** (Math Learning Communities program) to address funding separately and retaining **HB 716** (Dual and Concurrent Enrollment Program) for further discussion.

### **Public Transportation Funding**
The House also addressed the critical role of public transportation in supporting vulnerable populations, economic growth, and community connectivity.

1. **Importance of Public Transit**:
   - Public transit is vital for individuals with disabilities, mental health challenges, and the elderly, enabling access to jobs, healthcare, and community services.
   - It supports economic growth by connecting workers to jobs, particularly in industries like tourism and healthcare.

2. **Funding Challenges**:
   - Rising costs (e.g., fuel, parts, driver wages) and budget constraints have created financial struggles for transit systems.
   - The **New Hampshire Transit Association (NHTA)** is advocating for $6.8 million in state operating support for the 2026-2027 budget to sustain and expand services.
   - Without state funding, transit providers may face severe cutbacks, including reduced service hours, route eliminations, and stricter eligibility criteria for ADA-mandated services.

3. **Federal Funding and Coordination**:
   - Federal funding is essential, but state matching funds are required to access federal dollars.
   - The **Federal Coordination Council for Access and Mobility (CCAM)** framework was highlighted as a way to better leverage federal funds and improve service delivery.

4. **Call for State Investment**:
   - Advocates stressed that investing in public transit is a win-win for the state, supporting economic growth while meeting the needs of vulnerable residents.
   - They urged the legislature to consider public transit as an investment rather than a cost, given its significant economic and social returns.

### **Public Safety: Firearms Return Process**
The House Finance Division 2 meeting included a discussion on **HB 506**, a bill addressing the return of firearms seized by law enforcement.

1. **Key Provisions**:
   - The bill streamlines the process of returning firearms after relevant court orders expire.
   - It removes the requirement for courts to request background checks, shifting this responsibility to the Department of Safety.

2. **Outcome**:
   - The committee unanimously voted to pass the bill (7-0), emphasizing its importance in improving efficiency and clarity in the firearms return process.

### **Kindergarten Literacy Program**
The committee also reviewed **HB 671**, which aims to establish a kindergarten literacy program.

1. **Program Overview**:
   - The program, previously funded through COVID-19 relief funds, provided early literacy support to families statewide through a partnership with Waterford, an educational organization.
   - It ended due to lack of funding.

2. **Concerns and Decision**:
   - The committee expressed concerns about the program’s cost ($600,000 annually) and the absence of data on its effectiveness.
   - A motion to retain the bill for further discussion passed unanimously (7-0).

### **Conclusion**
The meetings underscored the House’s commitment to addressing critical issues such as education, public transportation, and public safety while navigating budget constraints. Legislators emphasized the need for accountability, efficiency, and collaboration to ensure that programs and services are effective and sustainable. Key priorities included maintaining funding for public transit, streamlining processes for firearms return, and carefully evaluating education programs to maximize their impact on students and families. The discussions highlighted the complexity of balancing fiscal responsibility with the state’s obligation to support its residents and promote economic and social well-being.
