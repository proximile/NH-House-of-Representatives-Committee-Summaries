The New Hampshire House of Representatives recently held a series of meetings, including executive sessions and public hearings, to discuss, amend, and vote on numerous bills related to election laws, procedures, and voter trust. Below is a cohesive and comprehensive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

### **Executive Session Highlights**
1. **House Bill 363**: Representative Lane proposed an amendment to address public hearing feedback, removing "compactness" as a requirement and adding school districts as a metric for communities of interest. The amendment passed by voice vote, but the motion to pass the bill as amended failed 8-10. The bill was subsequently deemed "inexpedient to legislate" by a vote of 10-8.

2. **House Bill 367**: Representative Wei moved to pass the bill, which aims to standardize the process for adopting partisan town elections. The bill was recessed for further discussion due to confusion about its applicability to cities versus towns.

3. **House Bill 481**: The bill, which moves the state primary date, passed 13-5 with bipartisan support highlighted by Representative Barry.

4. **House Bill 408**: The motion to deem the bill "inexpedient to legislate" (which proposed moving the state primary to the fourth Tuesday in August) passed 10-8.

5. **House Bill 600**: The motion to deem the bill "inexpedient to legislate" (enabling rank-choice voting) passed 10-8. Representative Wilhelm opposed the motion, arguing that rank-choice voting is widely accepted and empowers municipalities.

6. **House Bill 151**: Representative C proposed an amendment to correct a typo regarding the term length of Supervisors of the Checklist. The amendment passed, and the bill passed as amended 18-0.

7. **House Bill 429**: The motion to deem the bill "inexpedient to legislate" (amending the term length of County Commissioners) passed 18-0.

8. **House Bill 333**: The motion to deem the bill "inexpedient to legislate" (requiring moderators to designate electioneering spaces) passed 18-0.

9. **House Bill 220**: The motion to deem the bill "inexpedient to legislate" (closing presidential or state primaries) passed 18-0.

### **Public Hearing Highlights**
1. **House Bill 597**: The public hearing on this bill was closed, and the committee stood in recess until 11:40 AM. There was confusion about the vote summary, but the bill was not hotly contested.

2. **House Bill 514**: Introduced by Representative Barry, this bill aims to allow private individuals to sue for violations of election law. Currently, only the Attorney General can adjudicate such violations. The bill includes provisions for qualified immunity and requires individuals to first approach the Department of Justice (DOJ) before filing a lawsuit, except within two weeks of an election. The bill sparked significant discussion, including concerns about attorney fees, the role of the DOJ, and the potential for increased lawsuits.

3. **House Bill 365**: This bill, which requires proof of U.S. citizenship for voters, was discussed in an executive session. The motion to pass the bill carried 10-8, but there were concerns about its legality and the burden it places on voters, particularly those who are indigent. The subcommittee recommended further work on the bill.

4. **CACR 2**: This constitutional amendment, which aims to prevent gerrymandering by ensuring district boundaries do not favor any political party, was deemed inexpedient to legislate by a vote of 10-8. The discussion highlighted the inherently political nature of redistricting and the difficulty of removing partisanship from the process.

5. **House Bill 130**: This bill, which deals with the arrangement of candidates on primary election ballots, was moved to the consent calendar with a motion of inexpedient to legislate. The vote was 18-0, with concerns raised about the complexity and potential inaccuracy of hand-counting ballots.

6. **House Bill 154**: This bill allows voters to request that their ballots be hand-counted. The motion to pass the bill carried 13-5. Supporters argued it would increase voter confidence, while opponents expressed concerns about delays and the accuracy of hand-counting compared to machine counting.

7. **House Bill 158**: This bill was recessed as the amendment was still pending.

### **Public Hearings on Election Procedures and Security**
1. **HB 463 - Local Election Recounts**: Representative Robert Worry introduced HB 463, aimed at addressing potential conflicts of interest in local election recounts. The bill proposes that school board and select board members should not serve on recount boards for their own articles to ensure impartiality.

2. **HB 420 - Chain of Custody for Ballots**: Representative Travis Toner introduced HB 420, which focuses on securing ballots with reusable, lockable containers and serialized seals. Deputy Secretary of State Erin Hennessy provided testimony, noting the potential fiscal impact and the need for clarity in the bill's language.

3. **HB 492 - Recounts for Write-In Candidates**: Representative Timothy Horgan introduced HB 492, which allows state party committees to request recounts for write-in candidates in primary elections. This bill is in response to a specific incident in Strafford County where a write-in candidate narrowly qualified for the general election, but the county Republican committee lacked standing to request a recount.

4. **HB 574 - Background Checks for Voting Machine Programmers**: Representative Claudine Burnham introduced HB 574, requiring background checks for employees of private companies that program and maintain New Hampshire's voting machines. The bill aims to ensure election integrity by vetting those who handle critical election infrastructure.

5. **HB 497 - Evaluation of Voter Checklist Procedures**: Representative Robert Wei introduced HB 497, which mandates periodic evaluation of forms and procedures related to voter checklist duties. The bill is inspired by human factors engineering principles to ensure that election procedures are user-friendly and efficient, particularly in light of long lines during same-day registration in the previous election.

### **Conclusion**
The session concluded with announcements about upcoming bills and a reminder to submit reports. The next executive session was scheduled for 10 a.m. the following Tuesday. Throughout the meetings, there was extensive discussion on the implications of each bill, with members expressing both support and concern about the potential impact on election procedures, voter rights, and the legal framework governing elections. The committee also discussed the importance of bipartisan collaboration to address election-related issues.
