The New Hampshire House of Representatives held a series of meetings focused on several key healthcare-related bills, including **House Bill 357**, **House Bill 559**, **House Bill 701**, **House Bill 358**, and **House Resolution 14**, among others. The discussions centered on issues ranging from vaccine mandates and emergency medical services to experimental treatments for terminally ill patients and healthcare policy. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key points and themes from these meetings:

---

### **House Bill 357: Vaccine Mandates and Legislative Authority**
**Purpose**: The bill proposes to remove the Commissioner of Health and Human Services' (DHHS) authority to mandate vaccines through administrative rulemaking and to sunset three additional vaccines (varicella, Hepatitis B, and Hib) by 2026. The goal is to shift decision-making on vaccine mandates to the legislature.

#### **Arguments in Favor:**
- **Legislative Oversight**: Supporters argue that vaccine mandates should be decided by elected representatives rather than unelected bureaucrats, ensuring transparency and accountability.
- **Parental Rights**: Proponents emphasize parental choice and informed decision-making, with some expressing skepticism about certain vaccines (e.g., Hepatitis B as an "adult lifestyle disease").
- **Voluntary Vaccination Rates**: They note that voluntary vaccination rates are already high, making mandates unnecessary.

#### **Arguments Against:**
- **Public Health Risks**: Opponents, including healthcare professionals and DHHS representatives, warn that removing the commissioner’s authority could delay critical vaccine mandates during outbreaks, leading to lower immunization rates and increased risks for vulnerable populations.
- **Scientific Evidence**: DHHS officials highlight that vaccine decisions are based on rigorous scientific evidence, and New Hampshire would be the only state not requiring varicella and Hib vaccines if the bill passes.
- **Emergency Response**: Critics question how the state would quickly implement vaccine mandates during public health emergencies without administrative rulemaking.

### **House Bill 358: Religious Exemptions for Vaccinations**
**Purpose**: This bill seeks to simplify the process for religious exemptions by allowing parents to submit handwritten notes instead of standardized forms.

#### **Arguments in Favor:**
- **Parental Rights**: Supporters argue that the current form is intrusive and that parents should not be required to disclose specific vaccines their children are exempt from.
- **Reduced Bureaucracy**: They believe this change aligns with legislative intent and reduces unnecessary paperwork.

#### **Arguments Against:**
- **Public Health Concerns**: Opponents, including school nurses and DHHS, argue that standardized forms help schools track exemptions efficiently, especially during outbreaks.
- **Data Trends**: They note an increase in religious exemptions since the notarization requirement was removed, raising concerns about declining vaccination rates.

### **House Bill 559: Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Staffing**
**Purpose**: The bill proposes to allow EMS to operate with one certified EMT and a non-certified driver, a practice temporarily allowed during the COVID-19 pandemic, to address staffing shortages.

#### **Arguments in Favor:**
- **Flexibility for Rural Areas**: Proponents argue this is crucial for rural areas with limited staffing and volunteer availability, allowing faster response times, especially for non-emergency calls.
- **Staffing Shortages**: They emphasize the challenges of maintaining full EMT staffing in small towns.

#### **Arguments Against:**
- **Patient Safety**: Critics, including former EMTs, warn that reducing the number of certified EMTs could compromise patient care, particularly in critical situations.
- **Quality of Care**: They stress that EMS involves more than transportation and requires qualified personnel for life-saving interventions.

### **House Bill 701: Right to Try Experimental Treatments**
**Purpose**: The bill aims to expand access to experimental treatments for terminally ill patients by providing liability protections for healthcare providers and removing logistical barriers.

#### **Key Provisions:**
- **Civil Liability Protections**: Limits liability for providers offering experimental treatments, except in cases of willful misconduct.
- **Remote Pre-Screening and Consent**: Allows remote pre-screening and consent processes, reducing the need for patients to travel.
- **Broad Construction Provision**: Ensures the law is interpreted to encourage access to experimental treatments.
- **Right to Injunction**: Allows patients and providers to seek injunctive relief if state regulators obstruct treatment.

#### **Arguments in Favor:**
- **Patient Autonomy**: Supporters argue that terminally ill patients should have the right to try potentially life-saving treatments when no FDA-approved options are available.
- **Economic and Innovation Benefits**: The bill aims to attract biotech innovation and clinical trials to New Hampshire, leveraging proximity to Boston’s biotech hub.

#### **Arguments Against:**
- **Liability Concerns**: Opponents warn that the bill’s immunity provisions may conflict with federal regulations and could deter accountability for substandard care.
- **Ethical Concerns**: Some representatives raised concerns about unintended consequences, such as enabling physician-assisted suicide or expanding liability in unintended ways.

### **House Resolution 14: Antitrust Issues in Healthcare**
**Purpose**: The resolution called for the attorney general to investigate antitrust issues in healthcare.

#### **Outcome**:
- The resolution was **voted down unanimously (18-0)**. Critics argued it was poorly worded, not the right vehicle for addressing healthcare costs, and that antitrust litigation is better handled at the federal level.

### **Other Bills and Resolutions**
- **HR7 – Abortion and Women's Health**: A non-binding resolution sparked debate, with opponents arguing it overlooked critical aspects of women's health. The resolution passed 10-8.
- **HR16 – Frontline Workers and Vaccine Mandates**: An amendment acknowledged frontline workers who lost jobs due to COVID-19 vaccine mandates and supported their reintegration into the healthcare workforce. The amendment passed 18-0, but the bill itself passed 10-8.
- **HB117 – Interchangeable Biosimilar Drugs**: The bill allows pharmacists to substitute biosimilar drugs, saving time and money. It passed unanimously (18-0).
- **HB732 – Psychotropic Medication for Medicaid Children**: An amendment designated DHHS as the caregiver for children in the system when prescribing psychotropic medications. The amendment passed 18-0, but the bill itself passed 10-8.

2. **Legislative Authority vs. Expert Oversight**: HB 357 and HB 358 reflect concerns about the delegation of authority to administrative agencies, particularly in sensitive areas like vaccine mandates.
3. **Patient Autonomy and Public Health**: The discussion of HB 701 underscored the balance between providing terminally ill patients with access to experimental treatments and ensuring patient safety and accountability.
4. **Healthcare Costs and Innovation**: Bills like HB 117 and HB 701 aimed to reduce healthcare costs and position New Hampshire as a leader in medical innovation.
5. **Parental Rights and Public Health**: The debates over vaccine mandates and exemptions centered on balancing parental choice with the need to protect public health.

### **Conclusion**
The meetings highlighted the complexities of healthcare policy, with lawmakers grappling with issues of authority, safety, innovation, and individual rights. While some bills, like HB 117, saw unanimous support, others, such as HB 357 and HB 701, sparked intense debate, reflecting deep divides on issues like vaccine mandates and experimental treatments. The discussions underscored the need for careful consideration of both individual freedoms and public health priorities. Further amendments and hearings are expected as these bills move through the legislative process.
