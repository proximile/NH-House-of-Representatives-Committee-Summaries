The New Hampshire House of Representatives committee meeting focused on the discussion, public hearings, and votes for several bills, with key outcomes summarized below:

### **Key Bills and Outcomes**

1. **House Bill 658 (Oil Discharge and Pollution Control Fund Adjustments):**  
   - This bill raises the cap on reimbursements from the Oil Discharge and Disposal Cleanup Fund and adjusts fees on imported oil to address environmental hazards like oil spills. Testimony from DES officials emphasized the need to keep the fund solvent to cover cleanup costs for home heating oil tanks and other spills.  
   - The committee passed the bill with adjustments based on actuarial reviews to balance fees across oil types. The final vote was **18 to 1**.

2. **House Bill 660 (Historic Horse Racing and Community Mitigation):**  
   - Introduced by Representative O’Brien, this bill requires historic horse racing (HHR) facilities to compensate host communities with 10% of HHR winnings. It aims to address local mitigation costs associated with large casinos, as previous expansions lacked opt-in provisions.  
   - Concerns were raised about the necessity of the 10% fee, as municipalities hosting gaming facilities have not reported significant issues. Charitable gaming operators opposed the bill, arguing it unfairly targets their industry.  
   - The committee decided to **retain the bill for further work**, with a unanimous vote of **19 to 0**.

3. **House Bill 688 (Municipal Taxation of Tradable Gaming Facilities):**  
   - This bill authorizes municipalities to tax tradable gaming facilities based on their enterprise value.  
   - The committee voted **17 to 2** to deem the bill **inexpedient to legislate (ITL)**, meaning it will not move forward.

4. **House Bill 737 (Redundant Language Review):**  
   - The committee discussed this bill, which was deemed redundant because similar language had already passed in another bill (HB 247) with unanimous support.  
   - The committee decided to **recess the bill** to the next executive session for further review.

5. **House Bill 155 (Business Enterprise Tax Rate):**  
   - Representative Brier moved to retain the bill, citing the need to monitor revenue trends before making decisions on tax rates.  
   - The committee **unanimously voted to retain the bill** for further review.

6. **House Bill 417 (Repeal of Communication Service Tax):**  
   - Representative Brier moved to retain the bill due to complex interactions with municipal valuation of polls and conduits.  
   - The committee **unanimously voted to retain the bill** for further consideration.

   - Representative Brier moved to retain the bill, noting similar legislation was pending and that further refinement was needed.
