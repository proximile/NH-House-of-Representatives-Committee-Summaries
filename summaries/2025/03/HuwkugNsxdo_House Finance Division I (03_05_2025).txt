The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting covered a wide range of legislative discussions, with a primary focus on **House Bill 2 (HB 2)**, **House Bill 619**, **House Bill 216**, **House Bill 164**, **House Bill 67**, **House Bill 511**, **House Bill 111**, and **House Bill 66**. Below is a cohesive and comprehensive summary of the key points and debates from the meeting:

---

### **House Bill 2 (HB 2) - Retirement System and Financial Matters**
HB 2 sparked extensive discussions, particularly regarding changes to the **New Hampshire Retirement System (NHRS)** and other financial and administrative provisions:
1. **Retirement Benefits**:  
   - The bill proposes restoring **Group Two Tier B** members’ benefits to match **Tier A** levels, effectively reversing some 2011 cost-saving measures.  
   - Key changes include eliminating maximum benefit increases, removing anti-spiking provisions, including sick and vacation pay in earnable compensation, and adjusting the annuity multiplier to eventually reach 2.5% for all years of service.  
   - The bill appropriates **$27.5 million annually for 10 years**, reducing unfunded liability by **$98.2 million**.  

2. **Concerns**:  
   - Some representatives expressed concern about removing anti-spiking provisions, which were introduced to prevent pension inflation through last-minute overtime or special duty pay.  
   - The bill does not address **Tier C** members (employees hired after July 1, 2012), raising questions about its focus on recruiting and retaining new hires.  

3. **Other Provisions**:  
   - The bill allows state agencies to use existing funds to pay penalties or fines imposed by the NHRS or IRS.  
   - It includes provisions for position reclassifications, enabling certain employees to remain in Group Two even if their roles do not typically qualify.  

4. **Next Steps**:  
   - The committee plans to review the bill further, particularly the anti-spiking provisions and potential impact on Tier C members.

### **House Bill 619 - Solid Waste Management Fund**
Sponsored by Representative Karen Eble, HB 619 proposes funding the **Solid Waste Management Fund** through a **waste disposal surcharge** (a fee per ton of waste) to address waste diversion, particularly food waste:
- The surcharge would replace general fund dollars, with funds used for grants and supporting the Solid Waste Bureau.  
- Comparisons were made to other states using similar surcharges.  
- The committee considered retaining the bill for further discussion, especially regarding the surcharge amount and its impact.

### **House Bill 216 - Workers' Compensation and Pension Service**
Sponsored by Representative Carol McGuire, HB 216 seeks to remove the one-year limit on workers' compensation counting toward pension service for public employees injured on the job:
- Concerns were raised about the fiscal impact, as the number of affected employees and costs were uncertain.  
- The committee debated incremental changes (e.g., extending the limit to 18 months or two years).  
- The bill was **retained** for further data collection and analysis.  

---

### **House Bill 164 - Local Record Retention**
Sponsored by Representative Joe Sweeney, HB 164 funds a position in the **Secretary of State’s office** to assist municipalities with record retention and accessible document posting:
- The bill had strong support and previously passed the Judiciary Committee.  
- An amendment was proposed to align the funding timeline with the fiscal year.  
- The committee planned to retain the bill for further discussion.  

---

### **House Bill 67 - Accessible Voting Systems**
Sponsored by Representative Mark Paige, HB 67 aims to expand the use of accessible voting machines in local elections:
- The Secretary of State’s office supported the bill but noted the $100,000 appropriation was unnecessary, as funding could come from the **HAVA (Help America Vote Act) fund**.  
- An amendment was proposed to remove the appropriation and adjust the effective date to December 31, 2025.  
- The committee planned to consider the amendment and potentially vote on the bill.  

---

### **House Bill 511 - Cooperation with Federal Immigration Authorities**
HB 511 was debated regarding its fiscal impact on counties, particularly detainee holding costs and litigation risks:
- An amendment proposed by the **New Hampshire Association of Counties** would allow counties to hold individuals for 48 hours (excluding weekends and holidays) if they have a contract covering all expenses with federal immigration authorities.  
- The amendment also protects existing contracts, such as those with ICE.  
- The bill was temporarily held for further review and potential amendments.  

---

### **House Bill 111 - Extending the Ombudsman Position**
The Judiciary Committee debated extending the position of the **Ombudsman**, a role established to handle appeals related to cost estimates for information requests:
- The committee concluded it was too soon to make changes to the position, emphasizing budget considerations.  
- The bill was recommended for **retention**, with unanimous support.  

---

### **House Bill 66 - Right-to-Know Law Changes**
HB 66 proposes updates to the state’s **Right-to-Know law (RSA 91-A)** to modernize and expand access to government records:
1. **Key Changes**:  
   - Replacing the term "citizen" with "person" to broaden who can request records.  
   - Allowing electronic requests and responses, provided the agency has the technological capability.  
   - Exempting media members from the requirement to have a New Hampshire connection to request records electronically.  

2. **Concerns**:  
   - Law enforcement and municipal representatives highlighted the strain of handling frequent requests, costs of redaction, and technological limitations.  
   - Concerns were raised about the broad definition of "media" and potential abuse of electronic requests.  

3. **Fiscal Impact**:  
   - The bill could increase costs for municipalities and law enforcement due to additional staff time and technological upgrades.  
   - Some representatives suggested imposing fees to offset costs, but this was debated due to concerns about discouraging legitimate requests.

### **General Observations**
- The committee frequently discussed retaining bills for further analysis, particularly when fiscal impacts were unclear.  
- Amendments were proposed for several bills to address funding, timelines, and implementation details.  
- Discussions highlighted a focus on fiscal responsibility, data-driven decision-making, and alignment with existing state resources.
