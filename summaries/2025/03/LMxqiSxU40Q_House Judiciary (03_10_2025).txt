The New Hampshire House of Representatives held committee meetings and sessions where members discussed, debated, and voted on several bills, addressing a range of issues from labor negotiations to environmental accountability and budget proposals. Here is a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and outcomes:

### **House Bills and Committee Discussions**
1. **House Bill 400**:  
   The committee debated the bill, focusing on public versus private labor contract negotiations. Representative Horgan advocated for private negotiations as more effective, while others stressed the importance of transparency. The bill was ultimately voted down with a 14-4 vote. Representative Perez was tasked with writing the Minority Report, and Representative Smith with the Majority Report.

2. **House Bill 601**:  
   Representative Trip moved to recommend the bill as "Inexpedient to Legislate" (ITL), citing issues with its language and exemptions. The bill, which aimed to hold companies accountable for misstating environmental impacts, was criticized for being subjective and potentially leading to frivolous lawsuits. The committee unanimously voted to ITL the bill with an 18-0 vote.

3. **House Bill 614**:  
   Representative Burch moved to ITL the bill, expressing concerns about unlimited nominal damages and the lack of distinction between intentional and unintentional violations. The bill, which dealt with compensation for legal counsel, was criticized for potentially shifting nominal damages to punitive damages. The committee voted 14-4 to ITL the bill.

4. **House Bill 313**:  
   Representative Perez moved to retain the bill, stating it needed further refinement to be more acceptable. Representative Smith supported the motion, emphasizing the importance of improving bills. The motion to retain passed unanimously (18-0).

5. **House Bill 391**:  
   Representative Smith moved to recommend the bill as ITL, arguing it was too general and could disrupt the balance of harm versus benefit. Representative Burch supported the motion, citing concerns about unnecessary costs and duplication of efforts. The motion to ITL passed unanimously (18-0).

6. **House Bill 462**:  
   Representative McFarland moved to recommend the bill as ITL, citing First Amendment and property rights issues. The motion passed unanimously (18-0).

7. **House Bill 509**:  
   Representative McFarland moved to recommend the bill as "Ought to Pass" (OTP), arguing the requested information was warranted and useful. However, several representatives opposed the bill due to concerns about cost, unnecessary reporting, and potential federal funding issues. The OTP motion passed 11-7.

8. **House Bill 520**:  
   Representative Kutab moved to recommend the bill as OTP, arguing it provided necessary tools for the Department of Education. Representative Burch opposed the bill, citing concerns about expanding departmental power and lack of need. The OTP motion passed 10-8, with a minority report to be prepared.

9. **House Bill 587**:  
   Representative McFarland moved an amendment to clarify the bill’s language regarding one-party consent recordings, ensuring it applied only to parties with consent and not third parties. The amendment passed 16-2. The amended bill, which allows one-party consent recordings in certain circumstances, passed 16-2.

### **Budget and Performance Audit Discussions**
The committee reviewed the governor’s budget proposals, including potential cuts to the Board of Tax and Land Appeals (BTLA) and changes to the Judicial Council’s funding. Members expressed concerns about removing the requirement for a clerk and appraiser at the BTLA. The committee also planned a hearing on the Human Rights Commission’s performance audit for March 19th.

### **Other Discussions**
The committee briefly touched on the extension of deadlines for appointing counsel in child dependency cases, with some members suggesting the issue should be reviewed by the Children and Family Law Committee.

### **Conclusion**
The meetings concluded with members finalizing reports and preparing for upcoming hearings. Throughout the sessions, representatives debated the merits and potential issues of each bill, focusing on clarity, necessity, cost, and legal or constitutional concerns. The outcomes included bills being retained, recommended as ITL, or passed with amendments, reflecting the committee’s careful consideration of each proposal.
