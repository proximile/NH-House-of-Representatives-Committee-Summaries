The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting and subcommittee discussions centered on the complex and interconnected issues of state citizenship, voting rights, election laws, and election integrity. The deliberations featured expert testimony, historical analysis, and legislative proposals aimed at addressing ambiguities and inconsistencies in current laws. Below is a cohesive summary of the key themes and discussions:

### 1. **State Citizenship vs. Federal Citizenship**
   - **Distinction and Historical Context**: Witnesses, including Mr. Richard, emphasized the distinction between state citizenship and federal citizenship, particularly in the context of voting rights. They argued that the 14th Amendment clarified that state citizenship inherently includes U.S. citizenship, but statutory language (e.g., "resident" vs. "inhabitant") has caused confusion and undermined constitutional definitions.
   - **Legislative Overreach**: Historical shifts in New Hampshire’s voting laws, particularly the 1976 change from "inhabitant" to "domicile," were critiqued as legislative overreach. Witnesses argued that voter qualifications should be defined by the state constitution, not statutes, and highlighted the importance of the 1808 law, which was repealed in 1973.

### 2. **Voting Rights and Residency**
   - **Durational Residency Requirements**: While federal law prohibits durational residency requirements for voting, states retain sovereign authority to impose such requirements for state citizenship. Witnesses suggested that New Hampshire could re-establish durational residency for state citizenship without conflicting with federal voting rights laws.
   - **Residency vs. Dependency**: Discussions around **HB 289**, which tied voting rights to being claimed as a dependent on a parent’s tax return, raised constitutional and practical concerns. Critics argued that conditioning voting rights on the actions of another (e.g., parents) is unconstitutional and creates enforcement challenges due to the confidentiality of tax returns.

### 3. **Absentee Voting and Election Integrity**
   - **Affidavit and Chain of Custody Issues**: The lack of a proper chain of custody for absentee ballots was a significant concern. Historically, absentee ballots required notarization or witnessing by authorized officials, but this process was altered in 1979, leading to discrepancies in how absentee and in-person ballots are handled.
   - **Equal Protection Concerns**: Witnesses argued that the state’s handling of absentee ballots violates the Equal Protection Clause by applying different standards to different voters. They called for legislative action to ensure all ballots are treated equally and to prevent potential manipulation.
   - **Practical Solutions**: Proposals included dispatching authorized officials to witness voting for homebound individuals and ensuring absentee voting provisions are robust while maintaining election integrity.

### 4. **Historical and Constitutional Framework**
   - **Historical Evolution of Voting Laws**: The discussions delved into the historical evolution of voting laws in New Hampshire, particularly changes in the 1970s that shifted the focus from state citizenship to residency and domicile. Witnesses critiqued the repeal of the 1808 law and the abolition of the qualified voter affidavit, which previously required swearing to meet durational residency requirements.
   - **Constitutional Alignment**: Witnesses emphasized the need for election laws to align with constitutional principles, particularly Article 90 of the New Hampshire Constitution, which requires laws to be in harmony with the state’s historical legal framework.

### 5. **Federal Law and Supreme Court Decisions**
   - **Federal Impact on State Laws**: Recent Supreme Court decisions, such as those related to the Second Amendment and voting rights, were noted as significant influences on state legislation. The Supreme Court’s abolition of "means and scrutiny" in Second Amendment cases was highlighted as a key legal shift.
   - **Help America Vote Act (HAVA)**: The importance of HAVA in requiring states to adopt procedures for proper recounts and audits was discussed, particularly in the context of absentee ballot discrepancies.

### 6. **Legislative Solutions and Recommendations**
   - **Clarifying State Citizenship and Voting Qualifications**: Witnesses called for legislative action to clarify state citizenship and voting qualifications, restore historical definitions, and ensure consistency with state and federal constitutions. Suggestions included revisiting the 1808 law and related statutes.
   - **Addressing Affidavit and Absentee Ballot Issues**: Proposals focused on defining proper affidavit procedures, ensuring equal treatment of absentee and in-person ballots, and implementing safeguards to protect election integrity.
   - **Waiving Fees for Voter Identification**: Representatives considered waiving fees for non-driver identification to ensure no voter is overly burdened, as part of broader efforts to protect voting rights.

### 7. **Future Steps and Comprehensive Approach**
   - **Compiling a Report**: The committee planned to compile a report summarizing discussions and recommendations, with input from stakeholders such as the Attorney General’s office. The report would address short-term and long-term solutions, including voter identification, absentee voting, and residency issues.
   - **Retaining Bills for Further Study**: Some bills, such as HB 289, were suggested for further study to develop a more comprehensive approach to voting rights and residency issues.

### Conclusion
The meeting underscored the complexities of state and federal citizenship, the historical evolution of voting rights in New Hampshire, and the need for legislative clarity to ensure fair and consistent election practices. Witnesses and representatives emphasized the importance of aligning election laws with constitutional principles, addressing discrepancies in absentee ballot handling, and protecting the integrity of the electoral process. The discussions highlighted the need for thoughtful, comprehensive legislative action to safeguard voting rights while maintaining election integrity.
