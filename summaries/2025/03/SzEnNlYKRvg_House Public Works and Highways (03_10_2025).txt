The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting focused on a wide range of capital budget requests and infrastructure projects across multiple state departments and institutions. The discussions emphasized the urgent need for strategic investments to address aging infrastructure, leverage federal funds, and ensure long-term maintenance and safety. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points covered:

### **Infrastructure and Capital Budget Requests**
1. **Department of Environmental Services (DES)**:
   - **Dam Repairs**: Highlighted the critical state of aging dams, with 64 high-hazard dams prioritized for safety repairs. The DES has utilized $30 million in ARPA funds for repairs and reconstruction but requires additional funding for ongoing maintenance.
   - **Water and Wastewater Programs**: Requested lapses extensions for hazardous waste, drinking water, and clean water programs, along with $18.3 million to match federal funds for clean water projects under the Infrastructure Act.
   - **Superfund Cleanup**: $1.7 million was requested for additional cleanup at the New Hampshire Plating Company Superfund site.

2. **Department of Transportation (DOT)**:
   - **Rail Infrastructure**: Addressed long-deferred maintenance of state-owned rail facilities, including replacing deteriorated railroad ties and upgrading rail corridors. Approximately $2 million is needed for critical repairs.
   - **Highway Fund**: Prioritized sand and salt shed construction, fuel tank replacements, and garage roof repairs, with requests totaling $6.2 million.
   - **Transit and Airport Projects**: $390,000 was requested for FTA Transit match and $3.6 million to match FAA funds for airport safety and infrastructure projects.

3. **Canon Mountain Aerial Tramway**:
   - **Critical Need**: The 46-year-old tramway is nearing the end of its lifespan, with components that cannot be replaced if they fail. Initial replacement estimates were $25 million, but the sole bid came in at $33 million. While $18 million has been allocated, an additional $20 million is proposed, leaving a $10 million gap.
   - **Economic Impact**: The tramway generates over $1 million annually, and its decommissioning would significantly impact tourism and revenue.

4. **State Parks and Natural Resources**:
   - **Marina and Road Repairs**: Requests included $475,000 for marina improvements at AOG State Park and $1.5 million for road repairs in the Connecticut Lakes Headwaters property.
   - **Roofing and Infrastructure**: A statewide fund for roofing and repairs was emphasized to address emergencies like storm damage and septic failures.

### **Department of Corrections (DOC)**:
   - **Aging Infrastructure**: Requests included boiler replacements, electronic controls and camera upgrades, HVAC unit replacements, and fire alarm system upgrades.
   - **Safety and Compliance**: Projects focused on replacing outdated systems, such as the body alarm and man-down system, and removing underground diesel tanks to comply with environmental regulations.
   - **New Men’s Prison Facility**: Site evaluations and master planning are underway for a new men’s prison facility.

### **New Hampshire Veterans Home (NHVH)**:
   - **Facility and Services**: The NHVH is a long-term Intermediate Care Facility with 250 beds, funded by the state for 225 beds. It faces staffing challenges, particularly in recruiting nurses.
   - **Capital Projects**: Ongoing projects include drainage and water safety improvements, entry life safety improvements, and a new 20-bed dementia unit funded 65% by the VA and 35% by the state.
   - **Budget Requests**: Funds were requested for air handlers, diesel tank replacement, veteran tubs, beds, and medical lifts to improve safety and care quality.

### **University System of New Hampshire (USNH)**:
   - **Capital Budget**: The USNH submitted a six-year capital budget, with the governor recommending $20 million for fiscal years 2026 and 2027. Key projects include:
     - **Morse Hall Renovation (UNH)**: A $22.5-$24.9 million project to replace HVAC systems and modernize fume hoods, critical for research generating 40-50% of UNH’s research revenue.
     - **Hyde Hall (Plymouth State)**: A major renovation project nearing completion, with $1 million requested to finish.
     - **Morrison Hall (Keene State)**: A $5 million renovation to address life safety, ADA compliance, and deferred maintenance.
   - **Enrollment Decline**: The USNH is experiencing an 11% decline in undergraduate enrollment, attributed to demographic trends and regional competition.

### **Portsmouth Port Authority**:
   - **Market Street Marine Terminal Dredging**: $1.4 million was requested to dredge sediment and debris, allowing larger ships to utilize the port.
   - **Rye and Hampton Harbor Rip Wrap Repair**: $765,000 was requested to strengthen seawalls damaged by storm surges.
   - **Market Street Warehouse Replacement**: $1.97 million was requested to replace an underutilized warehouse with a new office building.

### **Department of Justice (DOJ)**:
   - **Case Management System**: The DOJ’s 20-year-old case management system, Praw, is obsolete. A $2.2 million cloud-based system is proposed, with a 3-5 year implementation timeline.

### **State Nursery**:
   - **Boscawen State Nursery**: A $2.5 million project is underway to modernize the nursery, including a new irrigation system. However, funding was zeroed out in the governor’s budget, raising concerns about cost overruns.

### **Key Themes and Challenges**:
   - **Funding Shortfalls**: Many projects face significant funding gaps, requiring creative solutions like bonding, federal grants, and increased visitor fees.
   - **Aging Infrastructure**: Numerous state assets, including dams, rail facilities, and the tramway, are outdated and in urgent need of repair or replacement.
   - **Economic Impact**: Infrastructure investments are critical for supporting tourism, freight, and revenue-generating activities.
   - **Collaboration**: Agencies are working closely with other departments and stakeholders to address challenges and ensure project success.

The meeting concluded with plans for further discussions on priorities and funding during upcoming work sessions, emphasizing the importance of responsible budgeting and sustainable funding models for long-term infrastructure maintenance.
