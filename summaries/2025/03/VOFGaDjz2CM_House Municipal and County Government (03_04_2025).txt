The New Hampshire House of Representatives subcommittee held a work session on March 4, 2025, to discuss **House Bill 432**, which pertains to recovery houses (sober living homes). The session began with the Pledge of Allegiance, followed by a discussion focused on key concerns and recommendations regarding the bill.

### Key Points Discussed:
1. **Certification Concerns**:
   - Members expressed concern that recovery houses can operate before being certified.
   - Certification is currently voluntary and requires residents to be in the home before certification can be granted, which some members found problematic.
   - Suggestions were made to require certification prior to opening.

2. **Parking Issues**:
   - Parking was highlighted as a significant concern, especially in neighborhoods with limited space.
   - Members debated whether parking regulations should be included in the legislation or left to local ordinances.

3. **Septic Systems**:
   - The bill’s impact on septic systems, particularly in homes not connected to town sewer systems, was discussed.
   - State statutes already address septic system requirements for changes in property use, but members wanted clarity on how this would apply to recovery houses.

4. **Safety and ADA Compliance**:
   - Members raised concerns about the removal of language requiring recovery houses to be "safe and healthy."
   - Some argued that recovery houses should be ADA-compliant to ensure safety for residents, while others noted that ADA requirements primarily apply to publicly accessible buildings.

5. **Local vs. State Control**:
   - There was debate over whether local municipalities should retain control over zoning and permitting for recovery houses, rather than having the state override local regulations.
   - Some members felt that local governments are better equipped to handle land use issues.

6. **Need for Recovery Houses**:
   - Members acknowledged the critical need for recovery houses in the state, particularly to address homelessness and substance abuse issues.
   - However, concerns were raised about the bill’s carve-outs that exempt recovery houses from certain safety and zoning regulations.

### Recommendations and Motion:
- A motion was made to recommend **ITL (Inexpedient to Legislate)** to the full committee, meaning the bill should not proceed in its current form.
- The motion passed **4-1**, with the majority agreeing that the bill requires further study and amendments to address the concerns raised.

### Final Thoughts:
Members emphasized the importance of ensuring safety and health standards for recovery house residents while balancing the need for these facilities. The discussion highlighted the complexity of the issue and the need for collaboration between state and local governments, as well as potential amendments to the bill to address unresolved concerns.
