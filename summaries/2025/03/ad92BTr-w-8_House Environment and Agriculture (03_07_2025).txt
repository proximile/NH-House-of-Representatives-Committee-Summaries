The New Hampshire House of Representatives meeting focused on two key areas of legislation: **HB 250**, which addresses the **muzzling and management of dogs**, particularly those deemed **vicious or a nuisance**, and a broader bill related to **animal welfare**, including **animal cruelty, confiscation, and protective custody of animals**. The discussions highlighted the need for **local flexibility**, **due process for animal owners**, and **alignment with state laws**. Below is a cohesive summary of the key points from both segments:

### **HB 250: Muzzling and Management of Dogs**
1. **Current State Law (RSA 466:31)**:
   - Defines **nuisance, menace, or vicious dogs** based on behaviors such as excessive barking, chasing people or vehicles, or causing property damage.
   - Outlines penalties and procedures, including **rabies immunization checks** after a bite incident.

2. **Local Control vs. State Control**:
   - Debates centered on whether **local municipalities** should have authority over dog muzzling and management, or if these should remain under **state law**.
   - Concerns were raised about potential conflicts between **local ordinances** and **state statutes**, particularly regarding **muzzling**.

3. **Proposed Amendments**:
   - Considered allowing **local governing bodies** to adopt **bylaws** for managing **vicious or nuisance dogs** as defined by RSA 466:31.
   - Focused on **muzzling**, with discussions on whether it should be explicitly included or part of broader **management practices**.

4. **Balancing Concerns**:
   - Emphasized fair application of **muzzling requirements** only to dogs with **problematic behavior**.
   - Addressed the need to protect **hunting and working dogs** from unnecessary restrictions.

5. **Final Proposal**:
   - Leaned toward a **narrow amendment** allowing local governments to regulate **muzzling of vicious dogs** while retaining existing provisions for **licensing and restraining** dogs.
   - Left **penalty structures** unchanged.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Plans were made to draft the proposed amendment, with acknowledgment of the need for future review of broader **dog management laws**.

### **Animal Welfare Legislation**
1. **Amendments to Animal Cruelty Provisions**:
   - Added language to ensure animals are not confiscated without proper cause, such as when an officer believes the animal’s life is in danger.
   - Addressed the right of individuals charged with animal cruelty to petition for a **veterinary examination** at their own expense.

2. **Protective Custody and Seizure of Animals**:
   - Clarified that animals cannot be altered or used for fundraising while in protective custody without the owner’s notarized authorization.
   - Debated the distinction between **protective custody** (for the animal’s well-being) and **seizure** (for criminal investigations), emphasizing that animals should be returned to the owner if no charges are filed or if a warrant is not issued.

3. **Lactating Animals**:
   - Included provisions to ensure lactating animals are not separated from their non-weaned offspring during confiscation, except when proper care is provided.

4. **Cost of Care Fund**:
   - Proposed adding language to ensure applications for reimbursement from the **cost of care fund** for livestock demonstrate proper seizure procedures and consultation with experts.

5. **Confidentiality and Integrity of Investigations**:
   - Added a requirement for individuals involved in animal welfare investigations to sign **non-disclosure agreements** to protect confidential information.

6. **Deputization of Humane Societies**:
   - Discussed removing the deputization of **Humane Societies**, ensuring only law enforcement officers have the authority to seize animals, while still allowing Humane Societies to care for confiscated animals.

7. **Study Committee Proposal**:
   - Considered forming a **study committee** to review the entire statute (RSA 644:8) related to animal cruelty to address gaps, inconsistencies, and outdated practices.

8. **House Resolution on USDA Slaughter Bill**:
   - Mentioned a proposed **House resolution** regarding the USDA Slaughter Bill, with plans to vote on it during an upcoming executive session.

### **Overall Themes**:
- **Local Flexibility vs. State Oversight**: Both discussions emphasized the need for **local control** in managing dogs and animal welfare issues while ensuring alignment with **state laws**.
- **Balancing Protections and Rights**: Efforts were made to balance **animal welfare protections** with **due process for animal owners**, ensuring clarity and consistency in the law.
- **Future Review**: Acknowledged the need for further review of broader statutes to address gaps and inconsistencies.

The meeting concluded with plans to finalize amendments and send the legislation to the Office of Legislative Services for further review, reflecting a commitment to thoughtful and balanced policymaking in animal welfare and dog management.
