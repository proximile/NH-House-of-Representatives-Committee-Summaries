The New Hampshire House of Representatives recently held multiple meetings addressing critical issues related to developmental disability (DD) services, long-term care, Medicaid, and state-funded programs. These discussions emphasized the need for sustainable funding, improved service delivery, and equitable support for vulnerable populations across the lifespan. Below is a cohesive summary of the key themes and priorities from these meetings:

### **Funding and Service Needs for Developmental Disabilities and Long-Term Care**
1. **Developmental Disability (DD) Services**:  
   - Continued funding for DD services in fiscal years 2026 and 2027 is essential due to the lifelong nature of these services. The committee stressed the importance of supporting individuals from childhood through adulthood, noting low attrition rates.  
   - The DD waiver, which supports individuals with developmental disabilities, requires rate adjustments to ensure providers can deliver necessary services.  

2. **Prioritized Funding Needs**:  
   - Key priorities include rate increases for Community First Choice (CFI) services, guardianship slots for individuals on the DD waiver, and congregate housing for older adults. Congregate housing, previously unfunded, remains a critical need.  
   - The committee also reviewed the utilization of $500,000 allocated for recreational services in FY 2025, with a $600 cap per user.  

3. **Room and Board Costs**:  
   - A major concern is the lack of Medicaid coverage for room and board costs for residential service providers. Rising utility, rental, and food costs threaten providers’ ability to continue services. The committee discussed developing a county-specific formula to calculate room and board rates.  

4. **Transition to Managed Care Organizations (MCOs)**:  
   - Preliminary discussions explored transitioning long-term support services (LTSS) and CFI into the MCO structure. This could improve efficiency and quality of life but raises concerns about maintaining a person-centered approach versus a medical model.  
   - The transition would require counties to enhance capacity for medical evaluations and training.  

5. **DD Pilot Program**:  
   - A DD pilot program authorized under HB2 continues to support individuals until they age out of the program.  

### **Division of Long-Term Supports and Services Overview**
1. **Division Structure and Services**:  
   - The Division of Long-Term Supports and Services includes three bureaus: Aging and Adult Services, Developmental Services, and Family-Centered Services. It serves individuals across the lifespan, including those with physical disabilities.  
   - The Bureau of Developmental Services (BDS) consumes approximately 60% of the division’s general funds.  

2. **Workforce and IT Enhancements**:  
   - BDS has a 15% vacancy rate, which is relatively low given statewide workforce shortages.  
   - Significant IT investments have improved data tracking and reporting, particularly for Adult Protective Services (APS) and BDS, enhancing transparency and automating functions.  

3. **Service Delivery**:  
   - APS workers handle about 97 cases each, and the division has implemented a 24-hour online reporting system for abuse and neglect.  
   - Nutrition programs like Meals on Wheels serve over 37,000 individuals, providing meals, social interaction, and oversight for isolated individuals.  

4. **Legislative Impact**:  
   - HB2 provisions include funding for the system of care for healthy aging and the suspension of the Foster Grandparent program due to lack of funding.  

### **Medicaid, Nursing Home Funding, and State Programs**
1. **Medicaid and Nursing Home Funding**:  
   - Discussions highlighted challenges with Medicaid rates, nursing home funding, and ownership changes in nursing facilities, which have led to back billing and increased costs.  
   - The state is prioritizing community-based care over institutional care, with the CFI waiver being a key focus to help individuals remain in their homes.  

2. **Area Agencies and Service Delivery**:  
   - Area agencies play a crucial role in providing developmental services, with an emphasis on transparency and efficiency in billing and service delivery.  

3. **Waitlist and Service Access**:  
   - The committee clarified the difference between funding availability and actual service access, working to address barriers to service delivery.  

4. **Consulting Contracts**:  
   - Questions were raised about the cost and effectiveness of consulting contracts, such as those with Alvarez & Marsal, and whether internal staff could achieve similar results.  

### **Key Takeaways and Next Steps**
- **Stakeholder Input**: The meetings concluded with a call for further stakeholder input, particularly regarding the potential impacts of transitioning LTSS to MCOs.  
- **Funding and Rate Adjustments**: Ensuring adequate funding and rate adjustments for DD services, CFI, and congregate housing remains a priority.  
- **Community-Based Care**: The state is committed to prioritizing community-based care over institutional care, with a focus on improving quality of life for individuals with disabilities and older adults.  

Overall, these meetings underscored the need for sustainable funding, improved service delivery, and equitable support for vulnerable populations, while addressing workforce challenges and leveraging technology to enhance efficiency and transparency.
