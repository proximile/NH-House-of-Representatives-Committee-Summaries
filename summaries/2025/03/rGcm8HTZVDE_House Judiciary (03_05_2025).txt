The New Hampshire House of Representatives recently held a series of meetings addressing several key bills and resolutions, with discussions centering on education funding, judicial authority, data privacy, and family support obligations. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key points and debates:

### **Education Funding and Judicial Authority**
1. **House Concurrent Resolution 1 (HCR1)**:
   - HCR1 seeks to reaffirm the legislature’s authority over education funding and policy, challenging the judiciary’s role in the **Claremont decisions** (1993 and subsequent rulings). These decisions ruled that the state has a constitutional duty to fund an adequate education for all students, leading to ongoing litigation and court-ordered funding mandates.
   - **Supporters**, including **Representative Greg Hill**, argue that the judiciary overstepped its bounds by mandating specific funding levels, encroaching on legislative authority. They contend that the word “cherish” in the state constitution does not equate to a funding mandate.
   - **Opponents**, including **Warren Cormack** (Assistant Attorney General) and **David Trumble** (former representative), argue that the judiciary’s role is to interpret the constitution and ensure compliance. They warn that ignoring court decisions could lead to a constitutional crisis.
   - Education advocates, such as **Representative Pam Brown** and **Caitlyn Bernier**, highlighted the state’s failure to adequately fund schools, placing a heavy burden on local taxpayers.

2. **House Resolution 7 (HR7)**:
   - HR7 authorizes an investigation into a judge’s decision in the **ConVal case**, alleging judicial overreach, usurpation of legislative authority, and partisan activism. The resolution is not an impeachment but a preliminary step to determine if impeachment is warranted.
   - **Representative Mike Beler** argued that the judge’s decision exceeded judicial authority by mandating specific funding levels without legislative input.
   - **Opponents** countered that the judiciary was enforcing constitutional obligations due to legislative inaction.

### **House Bill 520: DOE Subpoena Power**
- **House Bill 520** seeks to grant the New Hampshire Department of Education (DOE) subpoena power to investigate alleged violations of the **Code of Conduct for New Hampshire Educators**.
   - **Purpose**: Proponents argue that subpoena authority is necessary to compel witnesses and documents during investigations, ensuring thorough oversight and child safety.
   - **Concerns**: Opponents, including the **New Hampshire Educators Association (NEA)** and the **American Federation of Teachers (AFT)**, question the necessity of subpoena power, citing potential overreach and a chilling effect on educators, especially in controversial curriculum disputes.
   - **Fairness Issues**: Critics noted that the bill does not allow educators under investigation to subpoena documents during the investigative phase, creating an imbalance in due process.
   - **Support**: Proponents emphasized that subpoena authority is standard in other states and essential for effective investigations.

### **Data Privacy: House Bill 195 and House Bill 522**
1. **House Bill 195 (HB195)**:
   - HB195 aims to strengthen data privacy protections by requiring **opt-in consent** for third-party providers (e.g., utilities, banks, ISPs) to access or use personal data, except in specific circumstances (e.g., emergencies, law enforcement).
   - **Supporters** argue it provides stronger consumer protections, particularly in light of the Fourth Amendment and New Hampshire’s constitutional privacy amendment.
   - **Opponents**, including **State Farm**, the **New Hampshire Bankers Association**, and **TechNet**, raised concerns about compliance burdens, conflicts with existing laws (e.g., **Senate Bill 255**), and potential delays in fraud investigations.
   - Law enforcement representatives expressed concerns about the bill’s impact on their ability to access data quickly in urgent cases.

2. **House Bill 522 (HB522)**:
   - HB522 complements HB195 by restricting government entities from acquiring, retaining, or using personal information from third-party providers without consent, except in specific circumstances (e.g., regulatory, investigative, or administrative functions).
   - **Supporters** argue it is necessary to implement New Hampshire’s privacy amendment and limit government overreach.
   - **Opponents** raised similar concerns as with HB195, particularly regarding its impact on law enforcement investigations.

### **House Bill 132: Family Support Obligations**
- **House Bill 132** proposes the repeal of **RSA 165:19**, a law that holds legally liable relatives financially responsible for supporting family members in need. Municipalities can seek reimbursement from relatives (e.g., parents, children, siblings) for welfare assistance provided to their family members.
   - **Support for Repeal**: Proponents argue the law is outdated and harsh, often straining family relationships. It does not account for modern family dynamics, such as estrangement or financial constraints.
   - **Opposition to Repeal**: The **New Hampshire Municipal Association** and municipal welfare administrators argue that the law, while rarely enforced, serves as a useful tool to encourage family assistance and minimize taxpayer costs.
   - **Rare Enforcement**: Testimonies indicate that the law is infrequently used, but its existence acts as a deterrent and reminder of familial obligations.

### **House Bill 188: Contempt of the General Court**
- **House Bill 188** addresses **contempt of the General Court**, establishing civil and criminal penalties for individuals who fail to comply with a duly issued subpoena.
   - The bill was prompted by a prior incident involving non-compliance with a subpoena.
   - It outlines procedures for determining contempt, including a vote by the House or Senate, and allows for judicial review.
   - Penalties include a **misdemeanor charge** (maximum fine of $1,200) and civil contempt, which could result in incarceration until compliance is achieved.

### **Conclusion**
The meetings highlighted ongoing tensions between the legislative and judicial branches over education funding and the interpretation of the state constitution. Debates on **House Bill 520**, **House Bill 195**, and **House Bill 132** centered on balancing oversight, privacy, and fairness with concerns about overreach, compliance burdens, and outdated laws. The committee is expected to consider amendments to address these issues before moving forward with the bills.
