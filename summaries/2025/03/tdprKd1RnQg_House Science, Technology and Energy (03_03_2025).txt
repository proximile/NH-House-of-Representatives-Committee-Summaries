The New Hampshire House of Representatives held a series of meetings focused on energy efficiency, utility regulation, property taxes, and environmental legislation. Here is a cohesive summary of the key discussions and decisions:

### **Energy Efficiency and Weatherization**
1. **Weatherization Initiatives**:
   - The committee emphasized the significant impact of residential energy use on the state's carbon emissions, noting that weatherizing homes could reduce emissions equivalent to removing 50,000 cars from the road. This effort aligns with New Hampshire’s 2030 sustainability goals.
   - A new study committee was proposed to strategize weatherization efforts, particularly targeting low-income and rural households that face energy insecurity. Existing programs like the New Hampshire Saves program were discussed, with a call for a centralized body to unify stakeholders and leverage federal funds.
   - **House Bill 599** was introduced to establish a committee to examine weatherization initiatives, addressing the high energy costs faced by families in older homes.

### **Property Tax and Utility Regulation**
2. **House Bill 696 FN**:
   - The committee recommended "ought to pass" (OTP) for this bill, which seeks to exempt electricity generators from the utility property tax and include them under the Statewide Education Property Tax. This change aims to reduce litigation costs and treat electricity generators as manufacturers rather than utilities. The bill preserves pilot agreements for generators until 2032 and ensures stable education funding despite the shift in tax revenue sources.

3. **Shared Utility Billing in HOAs**:
   - The committee addressed the issue of shared utility meters (e.g., wells and septic systems) in residential condominium associations (HOAs) being billed at commercial rates, even though they serve purely residential units. Legislators proposed amending RSA 356b (condominium law) and RSA 378 (public utilities law) to ensure shared meters are billed at residential rates and costs are charged back only to the units sharing the meter. Utilities like Unitil raised concerns about the complexity and cost of updating billing systems, but the committee plans to refine the amendment to ensure fair billing for residential units.

### **Environmental and Renewable Energy Legislation**
4. **House Bill 567 FN**:
   - The committee voted to indefinitely postpone (ITL) this bill, which aimed to eliminate useful thermal energy from renewable energy classes. The decision was based on concerns about disrupting existing thermal energy programs that many residents and businesses rely on.

5. **House Bill 764 FN (Geoengineering Bill)**:
   - The committee discussed an amendment to change the language from "prohibited" to "discouraged" regarding geoengineering activities, including weather modification and stratospheric aerosol injection. The amendment also proposed exempting cloud seeding in cases of catastrophic drought and requiring the Department of Environmental Services to notify federal agencies about the state’s stance on geoengineering. The amendment failed with a 9-9 vote, and the original motion to pass the bill also failed. The committee ultimately voted to indefinitely postpone (ITL) the bill.

6. **House Bill 219 (Electric Renewable Portfolio Standard)**:
   - The committee passed an amendment to HB 219, which eliminates Class 2 renewable energy credits (RECs) and reduces the obligation for Class 1 thermal RECs from 2.2% to 1.7%, aiming to save ratepayers money. The amendment also adjusted alternative compliance payment (ACP) rates to align with neighboring states. The bill passed as amended with a 10-8 vote, and both majority and minority reports will be prepared.

### **Department of Energy (DOE) and Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Restructuring**
7. **House Bill 266**:
   - This bill proposes structural changes to clarify the roles and responsibilities of the DOE and PUC following a 2021 restructuring. The DOE supports the bill, arguing it aligns with the intent to give elected officials control over energy policy. However, the PUC raised concerns about the DOE’s optional participation in proceedings, which could slow down adjudication and require additional resources. The committee discussed potential amendments to address these issues, including retaining the requirement that the DOE be a party to all proceedings and clarifying the DOE’s authority to investigate matters and provide evidence to the PUC.

### **Federal Energy Policy**
8. **House Resolution 15**:
   - This resolution urges Congress to change Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) policies to ensure that only just and reasonable costs associated with new or upgraded electrical transmission projects are passed on to ratepayers. Current FERC practices presume the prudence of transmission costs, leading to higher rates for consumers without adequate scrutiny.

### **Future Meetings and Work Sessions**
- The committee scheduled additional work sessions to discuss remaining bills, including those related to residential condominium property electric rates. They also planned to meet on March 10th to address the remaining 11 bills, with the possibility of extending the session if necessary.

### **Conclusion**
The meetings highlighted the committee’s efforts to balance energy efficiency, environmental protection, and fair utility regulation while considering the financial and practical impacts on residents and businesses. Key themes included the need for centralized weatherization efforts, fair property tax treatment for utilities, and clear roles for the DOE and PUC in energy regulation. The committee’s decisions reflected a mix of advancing, amending, and indefinitely postponing various bills based on their potential impacts and feasibility.
