The New Hampshire House of Representatives recently held a series of meetings covering a wide range of legislative topics, including healthcare, alcohol regulations, public safety, and financial policies. Here’s a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and decisions:

### **Healthcare and Insurance**
1. **Medical Device Eligibility**:  
   The House debated whether eligibility for medical devices should be determined by doctors rather than insurance companies. Proponents argued that doctors better understand patient needs, while concerns were raised about potential unnecessary expenses if devices were prescribed for convenience rather than medical necessity. The motion to retain the bill for further discussion passed.

2. **Medicare Supplemental Policies**:  
   The discussion centered on whether Medicare supplemental policies should cover pre-existing conditions. Representative Spear highlighted the effectiveness and high satisfaction rates of current Medicare Advantage plans, citing data from CMS and the Kaiser Family Foundation. He expressed concerns about increasing costs for existing plan holders if pre-existing conditions were mandated. The motion to retain the bill for further discussion passed.

3. **Insurance Coverage for Glucose Monitoring**:  
   A bill addressing insurance coverage for glucose monitoring was retained for further discussion due to evolving science and insurance criteria.

### **Alcohol Regulations**
1. **House Bill 529 (Liquor Law Changes)**:  
   Representative Grill introduced HB 529, proposing several changes to alcohol regulations, including extending the last call for on-site alcohol service from 1 AM to 2 AM statewide, allowing municipalities to authorize a 3 AM last call, extending in-store sales hours, allowing bartenders to refill growlers, and legalizing the sale of to-go cocktails. The bill aims to enhance personal freedom, boost the local economy, and align New Hampshire's liquor laws with neighboring states. Concerns were raised about public safety, enforcement costs, and business impacts, particularly regarding staffing shortages and third-party delivery services. The committee moved to retain the bill for further discussion.

2. **Extended Hours and Public Awareness**:  
   There was a discussion about extending service hours for special events and public awareness of current laws allowing service until 2 AM. It was clarified that while extensions can be approved by the Liquor Commission, local municipalities are consulted for input.

3. **Cup Sealing and Delivery**:  
   Concerns were raised about the feasibility of sealing cups for alcohol delivery and the potential for increased drunk driving incidents. The debate highlighted differing perspectives on third-party delivery services and the need for age verification.

### **Public Safety and Infrastructure**
1. **Tree Cutting and Roof Safety**:  
   A bill related to federal grants for tree cutting and roof safety improvements was discussed, with concerns raised about insurance companies denying claims based on roof construction standards. The motion to retain the bill for further discussion passed.

### **Financial Policies and Investments**
1. **House Bill 302 (Digital Assets and Precious Metals)**:  
   This bill allows the state treasurer to invest in digital assets and precious metals. After discussion, the committee passed an amendment simplifying the bill and limiting investments to 5% of funds. The bill was passed as amended, 17-0.

2. **House Bill 639 (Blockchain and Digital Currencies)**:  
   This bill involved the use and disputes of blockchain and digital currencies. After extensive discussion, the committee passed it as amended, 14-3, with some members expressing concerns about energy usage and the need for further study.

### **Other Legislative Actions**
1. **House Bill 185 (Ambulance Service Reimbursement)**:  
   This bill related to reimbursement rates for ambulance service providers. The committee voted 16-0 to deem it inexpedient to legislate, meaning it will not move forward.

3. **House Bill 241 (Treatment Alternatives to Opioids)**:
