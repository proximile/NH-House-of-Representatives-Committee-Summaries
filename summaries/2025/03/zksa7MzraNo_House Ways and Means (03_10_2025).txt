The New Hampshire House of Representatives held a series of meetings focused on gaming regulations, revenue distribution, and legislative oversight, with particular attention to **House Bill 728 (HB 728)**, **HB 737**, and **HB 2**. These bills propose significant changes to the state’s charitable gaming industry, including the transition from **Historic Horse Racing (HHR) machines** to **Video Lottery Terminals (VLTs)**, adjustments to revenue sharing, and enhanced local control over gaming establishments. Below is a comprehensive summary of the key discussions and decisions:

### **1. Transition from HHR to VLTs**
- **HB 728** proposes phasing out HHR machines by January 1, 2028, and replacing them with VLTs, which are more cost-effective and secure. The transition would primarily involve software changes, with costs estimated at $3,000 to $4,000 per machine.
- VLTs are seen as more competitive due to lower operational costs and a broader market of manufacturers, offering better efficiency and revenue potential compared to HHR machines.

### **2. Revenue Distribution Changes**
- The bills aim to adjust revenue sharing among operators, charities, and the state. **HB 728** increases the state’s share from 25% to 30% and reduces operators’ share from 75% to 70%. Charities would see their share rise from 8.33% to 10.5%.
- **HB 2** proposes different tax rates for VLTs, with the governor suggesting a 55-45% split (operator-state) and the Senate proposing a 35% tax rate. Senator Tim Lang recommended a 32.5% tax rate as a compromise.
- Concerns were raised about potential revenue losses to the **Education Trust Fund (ETF)** due to changes in tax distributions, with debates over shifting funds from the ETF to the **General Fund**.

### **3. Local Control and Opt-Out Provisions**
- **HB 737** allows localities to opt out of allowing gaming establishments, with amendments reducing the timeframe for non-operation from 10 years to 6 years. The bill passed unanimously and was placed on the consent calendar.
- Representatives emphasized the importance of local control, ensuring that towns can vote on whether to allow gaming facilities and retain oversight over their operations.

### **4. Problem Gambling and Regulatory Capacity**
- The bills introduce steady funding streams for problem gaming services, addressing concerns about insufficient resources for gambling addiction. However, there were concerns about the state’s capacity to regulate up to 6,000 VLTs, with calls for additional staff and resources to manage the expanding gaming industry.

### **5. Economic and Market Considerations**
- Discussions highlighted the saturation point for gaming machines in New Hampshire, with an estimated limit of 6,000 machines. Currently, there are around 3,500 machines, leaving room for approximately 2,600 more.
- The opening of new casinos, such as the one in Nashua, was expected to impact existing facilities like Gate City Casino, reflecting the competitive nature of the gaming industry.

### **6. Legislative Oversight and Commission Structure**
- Concerns were raised about the structure of the gaming commission, with suggestions to include legislative oversight or a joint House-Senate committee to ensure transparency and accountability.
- Licensing fees in New Hampshire are significantly lower than in neighboring states, which was seen as an incentive for operators. Licenses are non-transferable on their own but can be sold as part of a business transaction.

### **7. Education Funding and Teacher Pensions**
- There was a strong push to address disparities in teacher pensions, with suggestions to use surplus gaming revenue to fund cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) for retired teachers.
- The governor’s proposal to shift $95 million from the ETF to the General Fund sparked debates about the impact on public education funding, with some advocating for a 60-40 split in favor of the ETF.

### **8. Fiscal Impact and Revenue Projections**
- The Lottery Director indicated that revenue estimates would likely be revised upward due to recent facility openings and increased demand, suggesting the bills could generate significant additional revenue for the state.
- Representatives debated the potential economic impact of gaming, with estimates suggesting significant funds could be generated for education and municipal tax relief.

### **9. Next Steps and Scheduling**
- The House scheduled upcoming legislative sessions to address key bills, with tentative meeting dates set for **Tuesday the 18th** and **Tuesday the 25th**. The speaker expressed confidence in Jordan’s ability to chair the meeting in their absence.

### **10. Public Testimony and Support**
- Stakeholders, including the New Hampshire Charitable Gaming Operators Association, supported the bills, viewing them as a natural progression for the industry. Public testimony emphasized the need to modernize the gaming model and ensure fair revenue distribution.

### **Conclusion**
The New Hampshire House of Representatives’ discussions reflect a cautious yet forward-looking approach to gaming regulation, balancing the interests of operators, local communities, and the state. The proposed bills aim to modernize the charitable gaming industry, increase state and charity revenues, address operational inefficiencies, and ensure robust oversight and support for problem gambling services. The next steps involve finalizing revenue distribution models, enhancing legislative oversight, and addressing the fiscal impact on education and other state programs.
